Unfortunately, after that, Ubisoft somehow decided to use the old card saved on the account, which no longer works, instead of the new one I provided.

Second strike at Ubisoft is approaching,218,1g3dwx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1g3dwx5/second_strike_at_ubisoft_is_approaching/,187,"As of today, October 14, 2024, Ubisoft workers in France are preparing for a significant strike. This action stems from their frustration over Ubisoft’s new return-to-office policy, which mandates employees to be in the office at least three days a week. The French video game workers' union, Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV), is calling on Ubisoft's French employees to join the strike from October 15 to October 17, 2024.

The strike reflects growing discontent among employees, particularly following Ubisoft’s announcement of a hybrid work model that workers feel imposes unnecessary hardship. This tension comes in the midst of other challenges Ubisoft faces, including poor game performance and management decisions that have already upset employees and parts of the player base.

This protest could be a turning point for Ubisoft as it tries to navigate internal dissatisfaction while tackling broader industry pressures.

Why I don't buy Ubisoft games anymore,5,1g3d8oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1g3d8oo/why_i_dont_buy_ubisoft_games_anymore/,39,"Let me preface by saying this is not an Anti-Ubisoft take.  
I used to be a huge fan of Ubisoft games and stopped buying anything from them around 2017.  
Since the very first AC and Farcry2 down to AC:Odyssey. Recently it got myself thinking ""Why did I lost all interest about Ubisoft AAA games ?""  
  
One word sums it all for me: **Surprise.** Or more accuratly, lack of it.

Everytime Ubisoft makes a new AAA I am almost confident it's going to be an Open World action RPG, with map unlocking by going to ""towers"".  
I used to really like that, spent many hours and they are quite fun game even the new ones I am sure, but I just feel like I played way too much of this gameplay loop to keep buying more of it.

I would expect that from the same IP, but I feel like Farcry, AC, Breakpoint, etc all have the same ""feel"" with a different map and main gameplay mechanic (guns, swords etc). But they all ""feel"" the same imo.

Think of the changes between Farcry 1 (I know Ubi is not the dev), Farcry 2 and Farcry 3. All thoose game were very different and caught me by surprise back then. Farcry 4 and 5 all left more or less a twist on FC3.

To sum up, I am an adult now, and I don't have much free time to play like before, and I don't feel like spending that time playing the ""same game"" (yes, this is an exaggeration of my feeling) over and over.

I don't know if orthers quite old folks have the same feeling as I do.

And I wish on the AAA space, Ubi creatives had more freedom like they ocasionnally showcase on smaller titles.",East-Cat4535,1728904305.0

I am writing to propose an idea for an Assassin's Creed-style game that could not only be a thrilling and immersive experience, but also a powerful educational tool. I believe that the story of Queen Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba would make for an incredible game, with her fight against Portuguese slave traders and defense of her people's independence providing ample opportunity for stealth missions, intense battles, and political intrigue.

As we enter the era of 4K and 8K graphics, I believe that now is the perfect time to bring Queen Nzinga's story to life in a way that is both visually stunning and emotionally impactful. This game could be a testament to the power of resistance and the enduring spirit of the West African people, while also providing an engaging and entertaining gaming experience.

Assassin's Creed Hexe should have a Black female protagonist ,0,1g2qggg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1g2qggg/assassins_creed_hexe_should_have_a_black_female/,18,"I'm honestly going to ignore the hate, but I genuinely think that assassin's Creed hexe should have a black female protagonist. All we have had for the past 16 or so games is 4 black protagonist ( Aveline doesn't count because she's mixed) adewale, yasuke, bayak and probably Aya. While the rest are of different nationalities how is this right. In terms of diversity this is just sad, and I feel like it will be another 10 years before we ever get another minority representation in assassin's Creed. Sure Ubisoft has got the ball rolling with yasuke, but they shouldn't stop there. 

For something like assassin's Creed hexe, a female black protagonist really fits because they can tie it with the slavery angle, ( female protagonist came from slavery and her or parents escaped) this would give the charecter motivation to do what they need to do in the game, and give them a motive people sympathize with, And a goal. What's frustrating is that if they don't change the female protagonist, Young black women wanting to pick up this game won't feel represented. That's all I'm going to say.

Ghost Recon: Breakpoint,4,1g1xaq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1g1xaq0/ghost_recon_breakpoint/,0,"So I've been playing raids lately, and I must say, they sure dropped the ball on realism with this. Not only do they require you to play it with a full 4 man human squad (unlike every other aspect of the game), but all the boss levels are uncreative bullet sponges that force you to approach them the exact same way, gone is any element of stealth or creativity.

Not only that, if you raise an alarm and they call for backup, the game spawns in 5 wolves close to your position, who know exactly where you are and even tho it says they can't see you, they'll run after you until they catch you, then spot you, then kill you.

If you happen to drop a landmine as soon as they spawn and run away, they'll all blow up, and then soon after, another 5 wolves will spawn in and do the same. If you happen to escape where they can't follow you, such as off the cliff... then an attack heli will spawn and close on your direct location.

I love the realism of this game, but Raid was a real lost opportunity. They could've done a lot better than resorting to an arcade shoot em up. The gimmicks for ""difficulty"" sake is such a disappointment, absolutely kills immersion, and the aspects that make this game stand out among the rest.

I wish they made a realism variant for raids that didn't rely on these cheap tricks for difficulty and made the bosses an open world opponent that could be tackled in more than one way.

What would make such a mode stand out even more is taking notes from Splinter Cell: Blacklist, by making missions that can be accomplished either by guns blazing (assault), stealth kills (panther) or non-lethal sneaking pass enemy lines (ghost), and rewarding players accordingly.

Other than that, I'm really liking this game. I have logged around 220 hours so far, but I can't help but feel raids could've been so much more than what it is.

Any thoughts? What would you change or add to the game if you could? Would love to hear others' thoughts. 

P.s. what's with needing to shoot a helmet off a heavy (machine gunner) when you headshot them with a bloody 50cal sniper rifle, ain't no one surviving a bullet of that caliber to the cranium, I don't care how bulky the helmet is, it could be made of tungsten and you still dead!",Blackmist3k,1728729217.0

Assassins Creed,Division, Splinter Cell, Far Cry, Rainbow, and Ghost Recon. Splinter Cell has been off the radar since 2014 (Blacklist came 2013). Siege is almost 10 years old. Division only has 2 games and honestly we have the most stable online community in the games in my opinion. Then Heartlands got canceled. And now we're waiting on 3. Still. Far Cry and Assassins Creed fall ill to the same things. ""We"" didn't want level systems and ""looter shooters"". And the story got stale and gameplay repetitive.  Far Cry plots starting at 3: Pirates vs Natives and MC, Dictatorship vs rebels, Cult vs rebels, Dictatorship vs rebels. Ghost Recon Breakpoint came in 2019. It's a great game except it feels repetitive but still fun. I don't know, it feels like Assassins Creed isn't even Assassins Creed anymore. Ghost Recon and Div are barely holding on it seems like. Please listen to your fan base. Whats left of it I guess. Ubisoft is a cornerstone to my gaming childhood. I don't want people to fail or people to lose jobs.

When did Ubisoft fall off a cliff? Or was it a gradual decline?,26,1fytvun,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fytvun/when_did_ubisoft_fall_off_a_cliff_or_was_it_a/,107,"I’ve been a fan of Ubisoft for years, but it’s clear something went very wrong along the way. I’m curious, when exactly did Ubisoft fall off for you? Was it gradual or did they jump the shark at one particular moment?

For me, Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag was their last true high point. The naval combat was fantastic, and it felt like they had so much potential. But look at what they’ve turned out recently. Star Wars Outlaws is embarrassingly mediocre for a franchise with limitless possibilities, and Skull and Bones is just a shadow of what Black Flag achieved years ago. It’s like they completely lost sight of what made their games special.

Maybe it was with Assassin’s Creed Unity and its buggy launch, or was the writing was on the wall with the Watch Dogs series not quite delivering on its promises?

The way I see it, the rot has fully set in at Ubisoft, and honestly, I don’t see them recovering anytime soon. Unless some Elon Musk-type figure steps in, fires the execs and all these managers obsessed with squeezing every last penny out of us with microtransactions, and brings in developers who actually love making games, not just monetising them, it’s hard to see a way out. The culture need to be completely overhauled.

When exactly did their priorities shifted entirely to cranking out cookie-cutter open-world games and pushing live-service models, instead of focusing on creativity and gameplay innovation?

Do they have any chance of turning it around, or are they too far gone at this point? Can Ubisoft can be saved?",Nolan_q,1728371147.0

Why can you activate the exact same game twice on an account? I've had a key for rainbow 6 for a a few months. Wanted to gift it to a friend whos new to pc's. I gave him the key and he said it wasn't working so I went over to my account thinking let me check if the key is valid. And oh it was, but the problem is I have no new games but the code isn't valid any more. Contacted ubisoft but with their support I'm not hoping for much.
