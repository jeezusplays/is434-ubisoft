1fqjl48,OutlawGaming01,1727428529.0,A Japanese gamer’s perspective on Assassin’s Creed Shadows,511,1439,"Yasuke being a legit samurai has never really been proven. Yeah, he pops up in anime now 'cause it looks cool, but growing up, we never learned about him like that.

If the game's gonna be about a real historical figure, it would've made way more sense to go with someone famous, like Miyamoto Musashi, instead of trying to make Yasuke fit the role—especially since we barely know anything about him.

Making Yasuke, who probably wasn’t even a samurai for real, the face of samurai culture kinda feels like it's taking away from Japan's actual history.

That’s why people are saying the game’s guilty of cultural appropriation. It’s rubbed some Japanese and international fans the wrong way. Honestly, if Ubisoft wanted to include Yasuke, they could’ve just had him alongside a well-known Japanese samurai instead of making him the main guy.


What do other Japanese gamers think about this? 

EDIT.1:

Someone made a very interesting point below:

“Yasuke is our first historical protagonist” -ac shadows most recent “showcase” at 2:58

EDIT.2:  A common reply I keep seeing is: (BRUH, its just a game, chill)

Asian hate is real and having grown up in the U.S. (teenage years), I personally experienced many challenges related to it. Over the years, I’ve become more capable of defending myself.

However, when I see a French company create a non-Japanese protagonist in a game who is depicted as significantly taller and stronger than the Japanese characters, it feels like they’re promoting a problematic narrative. It comes off as culturally insensitive and tone-deaf.

Normally, I don’t pay much attention to discussions around DEI in gaming, but in this case, the decision feels particularly misguided and could have been handled with more care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fqjl48/a_japanese_gamers_perspective_on_assassins_creed/,2024-09-27 17:15:29

Assassins Creed,Division, Splinter Cell, Far Cry, Rainbow, and Ghost Recon. Splinter Cell has been off the radar since 2014 (Blacklist came 2013). Siege is almost 10 years old. Division only has 2 games and honestly we have the most stable online community in the games in my opinion. Then Heartlands got canceled. And now we're waiting on 3. Still. Far Cry and Assassins Creed fall ill to the same things. ""We"" didn't want level systems and ""looter shooters"". And the story got stale and gameplay repetitive.  Far Cry plots starting at 3: Pirates vs Natives and MC, Dictatorship vs rebels, Cult vs rebels, Dictatorship vs rebels. Ghost Recon Breakpoint came in 2019. It's a great game except it feels repetitive but still fun. I don't know, it feels like Assassins Creed isn't even Assassins Creed anymore. Ghost Recon and Div are barely holding on it seems like.

mwfo2k,Comprehensive_Part42,1619127854.0,I quit my job of 4 years at Ubisoft Customer Support. It was messy,184,37,"\#HoldUbisoftAccountable

I worked for over 4 years as a customer support representative at Ubisoft in the US. It's a soul-crushing job that really shouldn't have any reason to be. The customers are usually great, the coworkers are awesome, and the product is literally video games.

Naturally, the problem is the corporate work culture. Large for-profit businesses can't let anything be comfortable if cutting that comfort means more profit for folks at the top and for the investors. Growth is king.

So why did I stay for so long? I'm a gamer and I know how I'd want to be treated if I ran into an issue in a game or with my account. I felt like things could be better and I wanted to help make those improvements a reality. Recently, I finally remembered that great Ubisoft villain, Vaas, from Far Cry 3:

"" The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. ""

Quitting was not enough for me. I still wanted to try to leave things better than I found them. So I started writing my resignation letter. This was going to ruffle some feathers...

What follows is a version of that open letter. I do not and will not name any names and I have removed references to internal information.

I'm posting this here because the original was purged from the email servers before most of my colleagues could read it. Some of those that did told me it meant a lot to them and I wanted to try to make this available again.

Yes, this is a letter full of grievances but it's also a letter celebrating what I loved about the job and maybe inspiring the awesome people I left behind to demand better. Maybe you're in a similarly dehumanizing job. Whoever you are, this letter is for you:

>Hello Everyone,  
>  
>It's \[Ubi-Odin\]. Where I can, I will try to keep this constructive.  
>  
>Since we don't announce when anyone leaves anymore, I thought I would go ahead and take the liberty.   
>  
>After more than 4 years of deluding myself that Player First meant something, it's time for me to throw in the towel and follow in the steps of so many talented agents, specialists, and leads, back out from the cult of Ubisoft and into the real world with my head held high. This is effective immediately.  
>  
>This letter is, among other things, a chance to say my peace and close the door behind me so that I may never make the mistake of coming back a third time. This will likely burn any chance I have of working on a high-profile game ever again but if there is even a chance this could improve things for the teams I'm leaving behind and the players I had the pleasure to work with, it's all worth it.  
>  
>I'm going to miss many of you. In my time here I have met a number of my closest friends and most respected colleagues. In particular I want to share just how grateful I am to everyone who was cool when I made my big announcement. Your support literally changed my life.  
>  
>To the players I worked with, I enjoyed speaking with around 97% of you. Even when I had to give someone bad news or let one of you know you were requesting something unreasonable I had an opportunity to have a human connection and a chance to show someone kindness who might just have been having an awful day. I will truly miss the chance to work with you all further.  
>  
>Except the racists, the Nazis, the cheaters, and the phishers. You can all go screw yourselves. I've been waiting to say that for a while.  
>  
>Players, demand better from Ubisoft and remember that the agents are just doing what they can with what little resources they are provided. If you want better support, leave negative reviews any time you are ever feeling underserved so that the powers that be can't pretend everything is rosy.  
>  
>To all the agents and specialists who care about providing a quality service to players, even at personal cost, you're the real heroes. Maybe someday someone will reward you for your efforts instead of holding you hostage to stacked metrics beyond your control.To everyone supporting the agents: I didn't know many of you well but I think the ones I enjoyed working with know who they are. Thanks for being the foundation holding this flimsy department aloft.  
>  
>To Upper Management: I have nothing constructive to say to you that I haven't proposed in some shape or form over the last few years through the proper channels and been told there was no way it could happen.  
>  
>It's going to take a lot more than me quitting for you to start caring about your employees' mental health and on the job stress, or about whether they feel like an actual part of one of the most profitable companies on Earth. We sure aren't paid like it.  
>  
>I remain grateful to management for explicitly letting me know I made the same wages as Target employees, something I had not fully realized until that point. Target associates make more in base wages than we do at the NC CRC and are often offered more schedule stability. For reference, the Target base pay is $15. Support work for the RTP area ranges from about $14 to $30 per hour.  
>  
>Even McDonald's and Walmart have expressed an openness to raising their base pay to $15 in the near future.  
>  
>Ubisoft reported roughly $2,137,000,000 USD in revenue for 2019. How much of those profits did YOU get to share in after profitability bonuses were removed for all permanent employees below the Associate Director level?  
>  
>Before I made this decision, I was in the process of applying, for the second time, for a job at the literal same rate of pay I'm already at, but with significantly expanded responsibilities. That's how much this company has made me question my own worth. No more.  
>  
>A few parting thoughts for the agents I'm leaving behind:- Do not work on the expectation that this job will lead to glowing professional references you can use in the industry outside of Ubisoft (except from other ex-Ubisoft employees). At best they'll confirm you worked for them and what title you had. (Check the employee handbook)- Learn every skill you can there quickly and leave before you get attached, like I wish I had.  
>  
>or- Unionize. It would be catastrophic if there was a work stoppage in Support. What are they going to do? Grab a bunch of folks off the street and train them in less than a week (again)? Call back the folks they just finished furloughing? You have the power if you want it.  
>  
>Be excellent to each other. I wish you all the best in your future gaming endeavors.  
>  
>Sincerely,  
>  
>\[Ubi-Odin\]

I hope my words helps someone whose job makes them feel less than human. We're all born deserving of love and care. It's the systems that need to change.

Thank you for reading.

1fx78t6,Raidenski,1728184132.0,Ubisoft Is Reportedly Planning To Release 10 Assassin's Creed Games In Five Years,138,206,"When the news broke out that Assassin's Creed: Shadows was being delayed, it was met with mixed reactions. Personally, I see it as a good thing, as it gives the development team more time to iron out the bugs that are too often found in Ubisoft releases; it seems that Vaas Montenegro sat down with the executives and told them the definition of insanity... Or so I thought. 

Now it appears that Ubisoft is planning on speed running Assassin's Creed fatigue; instead of taking 5 years to develop one game, they're gonna be releasing 10 AC games in 5 years. 

Despite Assassin's Creed probably being my favorite videogame franchise ever since the first game, and having played every mainline AC game up until Odyssey, and having Valhalla in my library, I decided to take a break, as I had spent over 200+ hours playing Odyssey, and despite thoroughly enjoying the totality of the game and its various DLC's, it was exhausting enough that I haven't even gotten off the island of Kephallonia in New Game+. Ironically/coincidentally, I'm currently playing The Division; another Ubisoft title. 

As much as I love the franchise, I don't see how over-milking the AC franchise is a good idea. Each of the Assassin's Creed games have faltered in several facets that could have been improved had they stayed in development for a little while longer, but Ubisoft seems perfectly content with ""good enough""... Now their future as a videogame publisher is uncertain, with talks of a buyout by another multimedia conglomerate.  

Could this be the final nail on the coffin for Ubisoft, or could this actually be what it takes to regain their foothold as an industry giant and reclaim their status as a beloved videogame publisher? I think at this point, nothing Ubisoft does will sway some gamers who are dead set in their disdain for the company, but what do y'all think about Ubisoft's plans to release 10 Assassin's Creed games in the span of 5 years?

1frjbm5,zaza991988,1727544179.0,Ubisoft make me sad,67,93,"The obligatory thing to say is that I am not a hater, and I own so many Ubisoft games from their major franchise (AC, Ghost Recon, Far Cry, watchdogs, Prince of Persia, The Crew, The Division...)

In the last few years, you have noticed a drop in the gameplay quality of their games. I have a tolerance for long games if they are well-made. I truly enjoyed AC: odyssey and considered it as one of my favorite Ubisoft games (AC: odyssey should have been the start of another separate franchise that focuses more on mythology-based RPG and not an assassin game), i liked Ghost Recon Wildlands and Breakpoint (after the patches). I enjoyed Far Cry 6 and the division series.

Ubisoft art direction and environmental artists are truly some of the best in the industry and capable of releasing amazing-looking games that run well year after year. The cities they create feel very authentic.

Ubisoft also has good gameplay systems, from how the weapons feel and perform, to how the combat flows, to the additional tools they give you to take several scenarios. to usually decent progression system that let you feel more powerful at times goes on

The stories they tell aren't bad, but aren't great either, almost every Ubisoft game follows the same formula, a starting locked-off area that teaches you game mechanics, then three (or more) independent separate areas with separate stories and characters that you can take in any order, and then a final confrontation.

If I have to summarize what makes games turn away from Ubisoft games are constant small frustrations that eventually add up to makes the game feels like a chore to play. Let’s give you some examples.

you can take a look at Far Cry 6 with repeated quest design, and removal of leveling up perks instead of sticking them to clothing pieces each scattered on a different part of the map behind puzzles or enemy camps. Or the not-present main villain, or the fact best gear is hidden behind a paywall.

Almost every Ubisoft game's best weapons and abilities are hidden behind a paywall. Their games are built around frustrating/edging you enough to shell out extra in-game monetization for a game that you already paid for. I am here wondering how much extra money are they making in these MTX console/PC games ? 

Every Ubisoft game must have a merchant that doesn’t take the regular currency, but only takes a premium currency that either has to grind for an unreasonably long time with random weekly reward.

Or selling a complete edition or ultimate edition of the game that doesn’t contain all the content, and you expected to fork extra money on that.

Not to mention the online requirements for single-player games, live services for most Ubi games and finally removing content from your library that you paid for.

All these frustrations add up to gamers automatically feeling like they are about to get screwed because Ubisoft has done so repeatedly in the past.

Some Ubisoft games feel off is that in most cases gameplay systems don't work well together.

In LoZ:Botw almost every upgrade is behind a temple puzzle, but these puzzles are diverse enough with a separate theme that allows challenge your problem-solving skills, different combat skills, timing skills, or creativity and the game gives you all the tools to do that early on.  AC: Valhalla obviously tries to copy the idea of a puzzle behind weapon and upgrade but you end up with a badly designed puzzle that is either not properly introduced, or just looking around to find an opening from an angle to shoot a lock so you can enter a door to shoot another lock to get to a lame rewards (ingots). And the best/coolest rewards (weapons/armors) are hidden behind a paywall. What makes matters worse is that you will spend more time than you like just to find the angle from where you want to shoot because of the game's dense geometry and the art style. Or the never-ending skill tree that is filled with +1% damage while (random action)…. It just feels disrespectful of your time. Even Immortal: fenyx rising suffers from a similar puzzle design but to a slightly lesser degree. These games just feel constantly frustrating you so go and buy ingots from the store using real world money

Or stealth section in star wars outlaws where you don’t have any stealth tools and broken line of sight system.

Or shallow characters and repetitive missions in every Ubisoft game that the writers of the game think they are amazing and cool.

And this makes me sad. Most Ubisoft games aren’t bad, they are a company that targets a 7/10 or 8/10 game that hasn’t released anything a real GOTY in the last decade. It feels like maybe if they spend more time polishing the gameplay systems, better writing,  and better quest design they can end up with solid games every time because you can see the potential. Ubisoft feels like the smart kid in highschool class, who is set to do the bare minimum to get a passing grading that you know can ace the exam if they make the effort, but after a long time doing these, you started wondering if that can even recover because of their bad habits. That is why their games always go on sale soon after launch because no one wants to pay the full price for a game they have played before with a different skin on top, especially when you know another one in releasing in few month that will end up a similar experience. The best way to enjoy a Ubisoft game is to take a long break between their franchise and that what I think instinctively we are doing as gamers.

Splinter Cell, Assassin's Creed, Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, Prince of Persia, FarCry ... They were incredible games. Most of the fans came from this time. It was a favorite developer for many people. I will never forget the feelings I had when I finished Splinter Cell Chaos Theory for the first time, or when the huge twist happened on the first assassin's creed. Or the whole tactic and strategy involved in Rainbow Six Vegas. But you started to take a different path. They just started to follow the money; without realizing how much money they would have made, and how much they would have grown if they remained in the hearts of the fans. When you see companies like Activision and EA making tons of money just making a map, and putting players inside to kill themselves, it really looks like they made a mistake in making money. Why spend so much time and resources making AAA games with incredible story and gameplay? But do you know why Hyper Scape really failed? For Ubisoft fans, that was not your game. A free game, battle Royale, with no story at all? We don't expect that from you. For new generations of players, and for most older players as well, ubisoft has become just another developer. They don't care so much about the product they launch, just how much money they make. Some of us old fans still hope to see all the greatness that Ubisoft had. At least Activision is remaking old games from scratch. But I repeat, Ubisoft was known for the quality it brought both in the story and in the gameplay of its games. It will take time for your free games to make the success you want. It will take time for us old fans to forget about the developer you once were and the franchises you abandoned. It definitely feels like the majority of buyers of your currently games, AC Odyssey, Watch Dogs, Ghost Recon, are the forgotten fans of the old times, desperate to feel what they used to with your games. Pledging for it. You saw that you did not made the money that you expected on The Division 2 or Breakpoint. Part of the reason is because we, the old fans, are giving up about those times. You are distancing from your foundation, and that won't bring you much money for a long time.

1fcop2r,rebel761,1725886367.0,Ubisoft Shares Slump After Investor Urges Assassin’s Creed Maker to Go Private,56,72,"Shares of [Ubisoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FR/UBI?mod=ANLink) Entertainment plunged Monday after a minority investor called for the maker of the Assassin’s Creed videogame franchise to go private and install a new management team.

AJ Investments, a hedge fund based in Slovakia that holds less than 1% in Ubisoft, said in a letter to management that it was unsatisfied with the current performance and strategic direction of the company.

Ubisoft has been facing a number of setbacks in recent months. It no longer expects to release “Rainbow Six Mobile” and “The Division Resurgence” in the fiscal year ending in March 2025, saying in July that developers needed extra time to ensure the games meet players’ expectations.

The delays came after the group ceased development of “The Division Heartland,” a decision it made to redeploy resources to bigger releases such as “XDefiant.” Its share price has tumbled more than 50% over the last 12 months. Shares in Paris were down more than 9% on Monday after AJ Investments published its letter to Ubisoft management.

Juraj Krupa, founder and chief executive of AJ Investments, said he wanted the letter to be a wake-up call for other investors. The hedge fund said Ubisoft should go private and urged the founding Guillemot family not to block a sale process. It also called for the installment of a new chief executive willing to weigh the sale of some studios and lay off staff to cut costs.

Ubisoft didn’t respond to a request for comment on the letter.

Upper Echelon Gaming's video (lacks some specificity, involves honest yet important mistakes cleared up by Hoeg Law): [https://youtu.be/4MdxFitwEj4](https://youtu.be/4MdxFitwEj4)

This video talks about the new, upcoming change to Ubisoft terms of service, and **essentially they seem to be stretching their ownership into your creations if, more or less under any circumstance, any of their products are involved in these creations.\*** This seems to even stretch to being able to use your very likeness if it is involved in this creation.

I have been continuously worried about the recent push towards anti-consumerist and down right possessive attitude recently shown by the AAA companies but this truly worries me. Please, if I have missapropriated anything or have looked over anything I'd appreciate being enlightened. However, I am afraid this is actually a thing.

Edit: A typo fixed.

**Edit 2\*: I (and Upper Echelon) seems to have things wrong seemingly because of shitty articulation. It was most likely a misunderstanding (refer to Hoeg Law's video). Sorry for the upset.

Deliberately cranking the price up of each edition of the game exponentially to force people into their dog water subscription service. Not only that but the game isn't even available on Steam, because Ubisoft the multi-billion dollar organisation doesn't want to pay any fees to be on the Steam store   


I was so excited for Avatar until I saw it wasn't on Steam, but still I though maybe ill try it regardless. Then I got to the store page and saw the prices and thought nope I'll never be playing that game.   
It's going to be the exact same for this game too I wont ever touch it. I don't understand how it's possible for a company to be so out of touch $130 dollars for a video game.   


This is why people pirate games. You're games keep getting worse and the prices keep going up. When will you realise that. The to make things worse you don't put your games on the most popular store front on the PC platform to avoid fees. The worst part is people will defend this aggressive price gouging, because people swear blind allegiances to faceless corporations who don't even care of their existence and defend them to the ends of the earth it so weird.   


I was so excited for this but I can whole heartedly say I will not be buying this game or any Ubisoft title in the foreseeable future your company is sickening.   


• Sort your pricing model out

The division 2 is actually a solid title, great shooting mechanics, progression and world, however it didn’t sell quite as well due to a classic ubisoft tale, it’s a sequel to an overhyped first game that disappointed, just like watch dogs.

&#x200B;

Point is, this year, ubisoft have both of their biggest franchises releasing title, AC Valhalla and watch dogs legion, and the company success is heavily relying on these games, so any of these games release with remotely below average reviews, the company is really doomed, I personally have both of the games pre ordered as they both appeal to me as a fan of the franchises, but I really hope ubisoft has finally got their shit together and these 2 games are actually worth my $60 and polished unlike the buggy mess breakpoint was.

They made some of the most famous games known to man, which include Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs, and of course the best fucking game ever Raving Rabbits. Now you may question this. Raving Rabbits, why that game? Let me tell you. There are multiple installments of the Raving Rabbits game series, which I'm sure all of you have played or heard of. It was essentially a puzzle game with Rabbits! Family friendly, fun, and can entertain you for hours on end. Some of the best moments were when the characters would go ""Bwah,"" which sounds like gibberish, but if you decipher it slowly, then it reveals a darker story. You see ""B"" comes from the German letter ß, or S in English, but due to the Rabbits not being to pronounce S the simplified it by thinking of how it looks. Which means that technically the Rabbits created the English Lexicon. ""W"" comes from the North Korean money currency of ₩ which also means that the Rabbits possible may have originated from the Communist North Korea, and considering their raw power it technically means they could be related to Kim-Jon Un and therefor be demi-gods. Finally, ""ah"" comes from the mean of ""holy shit you scared me"" meaning the Rabbits can strike fear into their enemies and kill them with ease. Think about it. Have you ever seen a human in a Raving Rabbits game? I thought not. This means they killed off every human alive, and created their own video game series called Huge Humans, which means we all live in a simulation created by Rabbits.

Thats when i started talking with the support.

1, So support had no idea why is that.

2, I managed figure it out that i cannot choose this game ( ac valhalla ) from the selection becuse i have installed it at some point while i had uplay+ ( thats why fenyx grey aswell )

I MEAN WTF ..  the email address where i recived the bill is totaly different then the one i use for gaming .. and use different for social media aswell. So what on earth whoud that proof for them ? That the shop who sent me the email is the same as on the bill i sent them ? This was the reply ""

In orde to help us with the investigation we will need to see fullscreen images of proof of purchase and the proof of activation key. Fullscreen means the screenshot cannot be cropped.

Once we receive the requsted images that are in line with our internal policies, we will investigate this further. ""

Now, you might think that I'm a salty boomer who wants nothing more than to see Ubi burn, but here's the thing: I'm not! I love Ubisoft! I loved the company they used to be. Rayman 2 & 3, the Prince of Persia trilogy, Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30, the original Far Cry Trilogy, Might and Magic, Beyond Good and Evil, the Clancyverse. All of these games are must plays IMO (and as a fact), which makes it so frustrating to see them go down this path of betrayal of consumer trust and disrespect to a beloved property and Icon who helped kickstart them. Yes, Tom Clancy himself had no involvement barring Rainbow Six 1, but future games prior to GR: Wildlands stayed true to his principles of grounded fiction, believable scenarios, and tactics over OTT action.

Sure, Siege is pretty good, but it's going through one of the worst identity crisis I've think I've ever seen. And the Clancy games alongside it, both released and announced?

I explain my feelings and beliefs that got me to start this petition in the description of it, but here's what this petition entails: It entails getting Ubisoft to give up. Stop making Clancy games, and sell their property to another client. Because if XDefiant in particular is any indication, they just don't care at BEST and are hellbent on destroying the franchise for profit in a 'Scorched Earth' scenario at worst.

In response on January 8th I Received a message from Ubisoft support indicating my case was now under investigation, and I should hear back regarding it soon. Message can be seen [On imgur](https://imgur.com/a/nc9j0mJ)



On January 17th I reached back out to ubisoft to ask if they had an update on the situation and received the following response on January 18th: Can be seen [On imgur](https://imgur.com/a/nc9j0mJ)

I continued to reach out to them multiple times every few days regarding updates to this situation over the course of the next week, and on the 26th of January my case was officially escalated.  

On February 8th I reached out to live chat support to try to get an update on the situation and was told to once again continue to wait for an update

On March 7th I once again reached out for an update and was told to continue to wait until they had a development on my case.  Message can be seen [On imgur](https://imgur.com/a/nc9j0mJ)



In total Ubisoft has been in possession of my money for just under 1 year and 8 months, and after over 5 months of talking to ubisoft support I have continued to not have any progress made on refunding me, even after I have let the support reps know multiple times that I would be fine with store credit instead of a refund to my credit card if that would help to the solve the issue faster.

i don't think ubisoft should get the hate that they are getting... i have seen people complain about how much the games cost and the in game content but hey its up to you to pay that much not them... and if you think about it why are we not giving hate towards EA... like bro they are the most money hungry game company out there... for example (apex legends) $160 weapon recolour like why.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/10kmjri/why_is_ubisoft_getting_so_much_hate/,2023-01-25 09:35:43

I bought Motorfest back in Novemeber through Epic Store and went to install it for which I needed sign in to Ubisoft. I go ahead and sign in to be told there's an error. Fast forward to just before Christmas with a lot of back and forth, investigating and waiting it turns out my Ubisoft account was once connected to another Epic account (my old one from several years ago I no longer have access to and don't use) which I found odd because I don't ever recall buying a Ubisoft game before through Epic and they tell me I need to re-connect the Ubisoft account to that old Epic account.

Anyway last week after a break for Christmas and New Year I re-open my case and explain the situation about old the Epic account etc and they respond (unusually) within a couple hours however they have misunderstood my respone and think I have 2 Ubisoft accounts so send me a code to to move the support ticket to another Ubisoft account. I respond explaining they have misunderstood then back to radio silence since last week. Today I went on to ask for an update having had no response to find my ticket was closed!

12uqeym,EccentricSage81,1682127711.0,Does ubisoft use better textures/materials or formatting? why they 'look good'?,17,4,"titles like far cry 6 or assassins creed valhalla let you press was it the F3 key or P key and go to photo mode.. then scroll the mouse wheel forward for forever.. until it wont go zzzzk zzzk zoom in anymore..

then drone fly the camera around.. and close up zoom in while in the max quality settings but i turn depth of field/motion blur off when its an option. you would then notice ... gasp! details!.. details on the details! where do all these details come from that other game titles lack? i mean i just use a config ini text file document file turning on a bunch of AMD display driver functions like better than unbiased rendering by typing some words into a text file.. ultimateultrapsychoextremerendering in intergradingcrosshatchRDNArealityemulation rendering and other wordy things i type.. and boom.. the characters faces change like real when they fight. its so cool when they like snarl at each other.. rawr! its a super shame my card is a radeon 5700xt and CPU a 5700G.. so they're just barely powerful enough CPU to pretend to use the GPU. since its not an RTX card i cant ever do a single ray tracing thing. BUT well since ray tracing is a FAKE false lighting shortcuts technique like uhh photoshop plugins to pretend to real light BUT ISNT because better than ray tracing requires a post 1960s computer. Since i've AMD GPU and CPU because its a real computer i can just use scientific TRUE light raymarching truegodrays rendering ray casting instead. if u use UNBIASED rendering it looks worse and speeds up a heap. go figure.sure it still looks amazing in unbiased but 2/3 of the details and 'drawn to screen' goes away and it crops in when i unbiased rendering like mad. because i only have a HDMI TV and HDMI 2.0b is only ever 1080p 120hz in REAL COLOR FULL BANDWIDTH SC 12bitRGB 444 project file/desktop workspace and 10bit display panel output formatting it then needs too much bandwidth to go any higher than that. So i compromise a bit by massive render resolutions.. i mean monstrous.. and then 2.00 image scaling. my adaptive 60fps and freesync .. will always be the 60fps.. but the fake benchmarks and fake FPS keep showing 30-50.. man nvidia fags r dumb. so uhh.. what makes their umm textures so.. poppin fresh? in low lighting conditions in the right angles it becomes photorealistic! my phone games identical settings and quality and better than unbiased rendering as my PC.. its a rx 630 LG V60 AT&T model used refurbished bought cheap off ebay imported to australia from USA. since this is a vulkan title i should be able to run it my phone no problem. Other PC/mobile identical games run just fine. my youtube and netflix get my same 3d lighting and graphics settings applied to all my 2d videos when i reality emulate them also in infinitydimensionalemulation.

any chance of a 'mobile port' that could be used with say a ps5 controller on android? not like a stream it from your PC or console.. i mean on the phone!? remember when my phone isnt RDNA 1 and if you look at was it octacore RDNA1 or6cores the RDNA 2 AMD phones have 2GPU cores and are 2/3 faster again in the biggest fakest underestimation in history ever benchmarks released by the fake tech companies. so u should keep in mind that its performance per watt.. thats right.. PER WATT! is shockingly higher RDNA 1 to RDNA 2.. cards with a fraction the memory bandwidth have so much more performance and lower latency and more.. infinity .. literal infinity.. that.. well.. they're hard to even guess how much better they are.. RDNA 7 in the light processing zen core.. as in upgraded from the ps3's faster than reality cell processor that freely syncs with existence.. the zen core is one with everything! thats right.. you guessed it.. TRUE INFINITY INTERNETS! w00t yay party !! w00t.. mathematically yes science wins the internet! as long as you type in the right words and tell it what to do and use all AMD computers on the network. .. so does somebody with a RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 card wanna post some screenshost or videos so i can see what im missing out on?

heres my config file settings i copied it in maybe 7 times or more? 4-14? just game and window or alt tab and copy another game 5 mins.. see if its better or not?

heres a video file of some game play.. where i still hadnt seemed to set it correctly. i'll get there again someday. when i first did it. one .ini file and like 2 pages of words got me the best game graphics ever.. like 7 times the details and quality of reality coz you could see skin pores from so many meters far back like as if viewing through a microscope. but fags keep disabling my stuff. my RDNA 1:1 universe reality emulation DNA quality tool hasnt worked right since day one and i keep cranking it up and putting words like octillion googols before it and x99999999 after it.. trying to get it to work again and same thing turned on several times and true and false multiple flags.. and add it in registry too. when i find what retard fags are disabling all the true computers of the 70s and 80s i will totally wreck them by reporting them to the authorities for international espionage/sabotage obstruction of trade/business and market manipulation and not being able to do math the fags...

I wanted to create this post to highlight the positive thing that Ubisoft Mainz (BlueByte) managed to achieve. They are releasing an update for an 11 years old game to preserve all its features after the servers closure.   
This is an example that all Ubisoft studios should follow. Video games are the form of art, and games preservation is important so we, and future generations, can enjoy our faviourite games in years to come. I wish this will make a mark, so the whole company will realise that yes, old games are worth preserving, especially if they are trying to sell their subscription model (Ubisoft+), and you can't just erase your history.

Just like the title says I'm not sure why there hasn't been a solid solution/fix to having this error code come up when you launch R6.. I've been trying to fix this for OVER TWO DAYS NOW and I don't see and end to this never ending battle. When you lookup this error code on the internet all you find is a bunch of THREADS GOING BACK TO 2021 asking how to fix this problem with no fix in sight

Some people seemingly get this fixed within minutes with no explanation while others like me are sitting in purgatory hell again waiting.. I enjoy playing Rainbow 6 but I don't enjoy Ubisoft or their monkey brain Battleye software. I've scoured every thread on the internet looking for a fix for this and STILL no answers are to be found

It also doesn't help that when ""updating security measures"" fails instead of being able to retry it back to back you have to wait a certain number of seconds before it will even let you retry to ""update"" it again.. At first its 10 seconds and then 20, 70, 120, 350, 750, 950 and then it resets.. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO COMPOUND HOW LONG I WAIT IN-BETWEEN RETRYING AN UPDATE!?!?!? It wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to manually click the retry button every time!! But now trying to fix this for basically the third day now Ive waited over 5 hours in the in-game menu letting this timer spin around multiple times just so I can retry this supposed update when this is all just rooted to Error Code 0-0x00000001... This is the kind of stuff that makes me dislike Ubisoft as a company, I enjoy their games but I cant stand their un-userfriendly practices and are unwilling to fix these silly issues that have been an issue for YEARS and have been a result in countless posts.

You know that the fact that you employ someone/work with someone that upholds certain views doesn't mean you share them right?. I guess a company's employess must all have the same political views or get fired (that's real democratic right there) in fear of the ""public opinion outbreak"" if you get even vaguely associated with a conservative (or in this case a liberal that expressed one conservarive opinion).

 You used to not be able to get a job due to your race, or gender. Now you can't due to your political opinion. Be a democrat/left-leaning liberal or don't work, get canceled. I don't even like Helen, but it's fucked up that you can't disagree politically with the ""majority""  without facing censorship. This is dumb. And it's been going on way too long. And it's apparently only an issue with people on the right with shitty opinions. when it's people on the left working in this industry that support the Chinese Communist Party, everything's fine, that's cool. Who cares that they have people in concentration camps over there?.  

I wish we could just enjoy a game without having to worry that we may be enjoying the work of someone that thinks differently from us. How fragile must your psyche be that you feel threatened because there's someone who thinks differently in a game you like. If I see an actor in a movie who is a communist (for example) I don't give a shit. And If I see a catholic ultra conservative, I don't give a shit. You should judge artists on the basis of their art, not their political views.

It turns out that I do not get the full product, but some kind of ""circumcised"". 

 I'm already sick of it, I love to knock out achievements from games in Steam. 

 How to make a company integrate all the achievements for their titles into Steam immediately!?  

I do not understand why there is no criticism of Ubisoft on the Internet because of this O_o 

I demand to add achievements in all Ubisoft games in Steam, achievements for which are already ready in Uplay  just integrate it.  

Even with the old Risen recently adding achievements, the developers understand that this is an important aspect of the gaming experience today.  

When will ubisoft understand this???",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/13ykzb1/ubisoft_add_achievements_in_steam/,2023-06-03 02:42:02

1dfwc5a,BabaYaga3694,1718386113.0,How to Recover Your Ubisoft Account When Support Isn't Helping: Filing a BBB Complaint,14,19,"Hey everyone,

I recently had a stressful experience where my Ubisoft account was hacked, and the email was changed to a Russian one. Despite contacting Ubisoft support multiple times and providing proof of my account they have denied to give my account back

Thankfully, the issue has now been resolved, and I wanted to share a specific step that helped me get my account back: filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB).

Here's how filing a BBB complaint helped me recover my Ubisoft account and the steps you can take if you find yourself in a similar situation:

# Steps to File a BBB Complaint

1. **Gather Evidence**:
   * Document all interactions with Ubisoft support, including support ticket numbers, emails, and screenshots of the issue.
   * Collect evidence of your account ownership, such as purchase receipts or linked accounts.
2. **Visit the BBB Website**:
   * Go to the BBB website at [www.bbb.org](https://www.bbb.org).
3. **File a Complaint**:
   * Navigate to the ""File a Complaint"" section.
   * Provide detailed information about your issue, including how your account was hacked, the lack of response from Ubisoft support, and any evidence you've gathered.
4. **Be Clear and Concise**:
   * Clearly explain the problem and what resolution you are seeking. In my case, I requested that Ubisoft revert the email change and restore my access to the account.
5. **Submit the Complaint**:
   * Once you have filled out all the necessary information, submit your complaint.
6. **Follow Up**:
   * After filing the complaint, you will receive updates from the BBB about the status of your complaint. Ubisoft responded to my BBB complaint within a few days, and my issue was resolved shortly after.

# Why This Works

Filing a complaint with the BBB can prompt a faster response from Ubisoft, as companies take BBB complaints seriously. It adds a level of urgency and accountability, encouraging the company to address your issue promptly.

I hope this helps anyone facing similar issues with their Ubisoft account. If you have any questions about the process, feel free to ask!

Good luck, and stay safe online!. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1dfwc5a/how_to_recover_your_ubisoft_account_when_support/,2024-06-15 01:28:33

17odt5a,ZoleeKing,1699196693.0,Ubisoft's support system for its users is absolute garbage / non-existent,12,14,"I have never experienced anything worse in terms of receiving support for a product, service, or account that I have or own. And it is not just a single user's experience, as I understand there are a lot of people in the similar positions. 

The only way to get any form of help or assistance from Ubisoft is to submit a case to them. I have had a ticket open since the start of October to change my email address as I no longer had access to the email address (the domain owners have switched to a subscription based model and have deactivated old accounts that were not logged into for a period of time).  I used this email 12 years ago when I created my Ubisoft account. No answer whatsoever to date on the ticket. 

Fast forward to yesterday, somebody has logged into my account from Russia, so now my account is compromised. 

I now need to change my password, but in order to do that I need access to the email account associated with my Ubisoft account, but as previously stated I don't have access to it. I also can't change my email address because Ubisoft hasn't gotten back to me for over a month. 

After contacting the domain owners of my old email address, they were able to reinstate my account (with a clean inbox since my old mail was not migrated) and give me access for 3 days, after which I either have to pay the subscription or deactivate my account again. 

Great so now I can change my password right? Wishful thinking, because the email with the link to change my password just does not arrive. Neither does the email to change the email associated with the Ubisoft account, and neither does the link to enable 2FA on the account. No emails are coming through from Ubisoft, at all. It is a small, country specific email domain, and I have read that the system has issues with those. So now I'm left to wait, and pray that Ubisoft answers my ticket that has been open for over a month. 

I try with the admins of the Ubisoft Discord channel, where I have been monitoring the discussions for just two days, only to discover that multiple users are reporting very similar, if not the same, experiences that I am having. A user reported that their account has also been compromised and have been waiting for the password change email for over a week, one user has been waiting for the same for over a month. Multiple users reported that their ticket to change their email addresses (as they don't have access to the email anymore) have been open and unanswered for over 3 months! 

How is it acceptable (or legal maybe?) for a company this size to have no mechanism whatsoever to support users with simple things like changing of passwords and changing of emails, ESPECIALLY in cases where the users' accounts have been compromised. People have hundreds of dollars’ worth of games/stuff on these accounts. This is just unacceptable in my opinion.

1gc28be,SoSneeKee,1729883697.0,Ubisoft Support Experience,11,8,"Hello, everyone.  2 years ago, I signed up for a Referral Program for Rainbow Six Siege. If the program were completed, you would be granted an in-game skin.  I completed the program according to all parameters, but never received any reward. The program showed completed on my user.  However, the progression was stuck for multiple of my participants I recruited. No matter how many games we played, the progress bar would not increase. After filing a support case, which was subsequently escalated to an internal team, it was confirmed that the progress tracking was bugged and thus failed to deliver the reward that I earned.  At the time, ubisoft support said there is nothing they could do, as there was no way for them to generate a skin for my account.  I dropped it because I believed that this made sense at the time. Fast forward 2 years to now.  With the inception of Rainbow6 marketplace, players can obtain skins from past events, challenges, etc, so long as they have enough r6 currency to pay for it.  Thus, I opened a new support case in hopes Ubisoft Support could either provide me with the r6 credits necessary to buy the skin, or buy the skin themselves and help transfer it to my account.  Below is a record of my experience with this issue.

After referencing previous cases and once again providing screenshots that the progression tracking was bugged, an Ubi rep escalated my case again.  The result they found was that the tracking was indeed bugged at the time, which is why I never got the skin.  Thus, I explained that this skin is now available on marketplace and requested the allotted amount of credits so I may purchase it at no expense to myself.  For reference, this skin is now worth $700USD+/88k  r6 credits+ due to its rarity.  This is why I cannot just buy it myself. Ubisoft support once again told me there is nothing they could do, which I find hard to believe.  How is a support team that assists with r6 credit issues unable to issue r6 credits? They then said ""sorry about that!"" and closed my case.  Naturally, I reopened the case and asked to speak with someone who COULD help me.  Well, support continued to stonewall me, citing that the rewards program was over by the time I opened a case.  This is true, but their own website says that rewards may take 24hr+ to appear on the account, so how could I have known there was a bug before that 24hr time period?  I pushed this issue with support and continued to reopen the case, but they have now resorted to copying/pasting canned responses and bullying me with the threat of support strikes due to ""inappropriate behavior on this case."" As far as I can tell, the only inappropriate thing I've done here is ask Ubisoft Support to do their jobs. I have meticulously provided every shred of detail and evidence they requested regarding this issue.  I had to bother real-life friends to reinstall this game to help me with this referral program two years ago, then bother them again for screenshots proving it is bugged.  Ubisoft does not seem to care and refuses to provide me with a fake, in-game currency to resolve this issue.  It is a very simple solution in my eyes, but they claim there is nothing anyone at the company can do.

I have played this game since day 1 early access, with 9 years of purchase history illustrating my support of this game. My intention is not to generate malice towards Ubi Support, it is to give you some insight on what the ubisoft support experience is like: ""Yes we see proof of the issue, yes the issue was our fault, no we will not do anything about it whatsoever. Sorry you are out $700+, just let it slide this time, okay?"" I have included my entire correspondence with support regarding this matter so you may independently decide who is at fault here.  Please do not harass ubi representatives below.  I have censored the individual rep names to prevent this. It is extremely frustrating that they cannot facilitate such a simple request. I just want the damn skin that I earned.

glq2i0,austinwm1,1589758578.0,Why Valhalla is actually locked at 30fps.,11,5,"So I had a theory going into the next generation that some of my friends said I was stupid for believing. Turns out it's the truth and exactly what's happening

My theory: do to the unprecedented backwards compatibility of both systems, gaming studios would only make one version of the game(instead of two separate versions) with a separate(mostly automatically installed) free DLC that was graphics textures. This is very similar to what they already do with the Xbox one x and the enhanced packs you install for it. All of this to save money and development time.

If you look at the high end of current gen consoles you know that both the one x and the pro both can run games in 4k however both consoles can only do this at 30fps (some companies have opted to run about 1080p but below 4k to get better graphics and still get higher frames but we're talking about 4k games here because of Valhalla). Both new systems have been pushing the narrative of 4k at 60fps hard. And yes it is up to the devs to actually make use of these abilities. 

So looking at this information and the fact that the game is coming out on both generations and will be able to be played on PS4, PS4 pro, Xbox one, Xbox one s, Xbox one x, as well as the PS5 and The Xbox. It extremely like ubisoft is choosing to instead of develope multiple versions that would be able to take full use of next gen hardware, they've chosen to make a version for the previous generation and then port it to the next gen with a texture pack to make it 4k.

Ubisoft had a situation like this back when the Xbox 360 and PS3 came out with a splinter cell game. During this situation however they made 2 different versions. For the previous generation certain parts of levels were turned into cutscenes(ie a skydiving scene ) while the rest of the game was in downgraded graphics. The next gen version was fully playable(same skydiving part you could actually control how you fell) with better graphics. In this situation they made the game for the next gen consoles but then ported it backwards to the previous gen. 

Time will only tell how many games going forward are going to follow this same path of development on last gen hardware with texture packs for next gen consoles. With consoles making almost every game backwards compatible there's almost no reason for them to not take this approach at the beginning to save money and make maximum profit while selling subpar next gen games. I fear we won't see what the next generation is really capable of till we get a game made exclusively for next gen consoles with no thoughts about whether itll run on the previous generation. 

TL;DR: Ubisoft has made a game for the current gen consoles and are porting it to next gen consoles with a texture pack dlc, instead of developing multiple versions that can take advantage of each generations individual benefits. This is a practice we will see going forward for the time being and we won't truly see anything magical for next gen till it's exclusive to only next gen console.

I put 1 copy of far cry 6 in my basket and used the code bringing it down to £15.

knowing i was being paid in 2 days i went for it, only to check my paypal and they had doubled the transaction, one with the discount code, and one without. the transactions were 3 seconds apart so its obvious i couldnt have made a brand new order for another copy in that time which is what they are saying i did. 

because they had forced an extra transaction that i did not approve of £24.99 my account went negative and i needed to cancel before i was charged an overdraft fee but it did not give me the option to refund the more expensive one, infact it said not eligible immediately . so i had to refund the cheaper one for now under the assumption a billion dollar company could resolve this issue.

after loads of back and forth they refused to give me a partial refund to match the price i was actually supposed to pay but instead they promised to give me a full refund on it, not ideal because i wanted to keep the game but pay the price that i was supposed to pay, but i agreed because id already spent hours argueing with them on how theyre breaking the law. fast forward a few days and i recieve an email saying they are refusing my refund even after they promised to process it and paypal wont do anything about it.

I bought Far Cry 5 for cheap and played through the prologue the other day, I came back to it today to play some more and [I get greeted with this](https://imgur.com/JZDbC25), I think ""strange, I already linked it to my uplay account"" then to my surprise [I get the following message.](https://imgur.com/wOLXwWy) 

So I follow the instructions and go to ubisoft support on their website, I try to sign in but it just keeps loading so I leave it for a while... [I come back and it's still going](https://imgur.com/qoPLshn) so I refresh and try log in again and in the meanwhile go on the FAQs and go to the account section but [this is all the help I get.](https://imgur.com/Ss9Y4GM)

Let me make this very clear, *we should never be forced to use a third party to contact a company about a problem we have with them, let alone just to play a game we already fucking own*. 

All in all this just goes to show how little a shit ubisoft gives about it's customers. There's no automatic way you can submit a complaint through the launcher itself to try and get access to game you own which could then be later checked to avoid people exploiting it. No way of contacting them about problems with a game on their own website without signing in, which is evidently not a simple and easy thing to do. And no way of even speaking to anyone about problems with accessing your account for 6 hours a day. I know uplay gets a lot of shit but haven't bought one of their games for years and so haven't had to deal with it, now I see why people hate it so, so much. 

This is a company that grosses around 2 billion dollars a year but they can't implement a basic functioning launcher, a reliable log in system for their own website or 24/7 customer support without involving a third party.

10cw7sf,GrayWolfGamer-,1673819800.0,An suggested Ubiosft Franchise reboot.,9,8,"I think Ubisoft needs to consider starting over with a clean slate. Looking at their franchises it's mind boggling why they aren't one of the top developers. They hold a good chunk of gaming's most iconic franchisees, Far Cry, Assassins Creed, Ghost Recon. But chose to essentially turn them all into literally the same RPG-like game. It's time for them as a company to step back, and look what got them to their position to begin with. Having a diverse slate of games, From a lighthearted platformer like Rayman to an open world shooter like Farcry. 

Most will roll their eyes and jerk away at the prospect of reboots, but their franchises are rung out and exhausted at this point, it's time simply to cut out most of the gunk, and go back to the foundations of what these franchises were originally about. FarCry needs to return to its sandbox roots. Take us back to the jungle, and give us an dangerous sandbox environment. Rayman could easily be the Mario of Ubisofts franchise. Immortals  could be their Zelda. The Divisions atmosphere is unmatched and could've done much more with its setting and tone. There's so many franchises that they neglect or twist to be something that they never were. 

In chase of getting their big hit live service game. They trampled on their franchises and now are scratching their heads on why they are failing as a company. Hopefully, Ubisoft doesn't sink, because I'd be a shame for some of these franchises to be lost forever.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/10cw7sf/an_suggested_ubiosft_franchise_reboot/,2023-01-16 05:56:40
1aqgmtl,lundon44,1707893167.0,Does Ubisoft customer support exist?,9,26,"Posting here because apparently Ubisoft's Discord, Facebook, Twitter etc all just end up routing you back to their same ""help"" page to open a ticket. A ticket which creates a case. A case that never gets reviewed. 

I hadn't used my Ubisoft Windows app in a while. But recently thought about buying the new Prince of Persia game. My app required an update, which inadvertently required me to log back in again. And the disaster begins..

After logging in with my correct password, my 2FA required a code to be sent to me via email that I need to enter. Well, after 2 weeks of trying every single day and trying different web browsers, no email ever comes with a code. Yes, I checked all spam and junk folders. Now my only assumption is that my account may have been compromised during my time of inactivity and my email changed on my account and the code is being sent elsewhere that I have no access to. 

First thing I did was look for a phone # to call Ubisoft. Of course one does not exist. They want you to open this ""case ticket"". So obviously I did. It's been 10 days with zero updates or responses to my case. This seems wild to me considering a company like Steam can resolve a compromised account in less than 24 hours. 

After searching for further assistance options, I see there is a Discord channel for support. Out of desperation, I join and make a comment like ""How does one receive a response to case that's been open for xx days regarding a possible compromised account?"". Apparently this resulted in an instant ban from the channel and now I can't type any message about anything anywhere on their Discord. Nice. Also couldn't help but notice their channel was riddled with other comments from people also complaining their can't access their accounts, they've been waiting weeks now for a response etc etc. I assume they all got banned too. 

Lastly, I see there is an Ubisoft Facebook page. I try hitting their"" contact us"" button which comically loops you back to their homepage to open a ticket. What happens it you try to open another ticket? You get a message that says ""additional tickets will only delay your response further.""

This whole process is enough to drive someone to abandoning their existing Ubisoft library forever. How does a company not actually offer any form of ""customer support""? Has anyone ever succeeded in resolving a problem with Ubisoft with a ticket?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1aqgmtl/does_ubisoft_customer_support_exist/,2024-02-14 14:46:07

Wow, what a week.

I have been fighting with Ubisoft to regain access to my Anno 1800 games after Ubisoft Connect forgot my details, and I could not log back into the account. All I get is various errors. So, I went to the Ubisoft support site to get help.

To my disappointment, they [shut down their live-chat support over a month ago](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/article/ubisoft-support-changes-to-live-support/000105563) in favour of using Discord, Twitter and Facebook. They provide an [account recovery form](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/contact?platform=29&game=50003&category=100&hideFields=all&af=1), which I filled in last weekend.

Usually, when you create a support ticket, you get an automated email telling you the ticket was created and someone will get back to you ASAP, but to my surprise, no email.....

Later that day, I questioned whether I had created a support ticket, so I tried again. This time, I took a screenshot of my ticket ID. A few days pass, and I get no response, so I go to the Discord server and ask in their support forum how long it would typically take to hear back. One of the Ubisoft employees told me that they could not give me that information and that I was off-topic. They then closed my request.

[The only response I have had from support thus far. tldr; not our problem, go away!](https://preview.redd.it/q2vjwtgsrkzb1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd6920656877d094320c839cfe6025ad31d421f)

I start talking to others on their Discord server and realise this is a far larger problem. Of the 19 active support topics in their Anno help section seven posted by other people are about similar issues, and all of them seem to be having issues getting support:

*Discord links: you have to be on their server to read these:*

7. [Anno 1800](https://discord.com/channels/863058244934696961/1171150217953955860)

Talking to one of the users, I realise that while tickets created under account recovery seem to get shredded - if we create tickets under billing (*aka the I am trying to give you money, but a bug on your site won't let my* category), I get the automatic email and the ticket shows up on my account page.

It really seems like Ubisoft has fired the customer support reps who help existing customers as part of their mass layoffs while keeping those who can continue to take in money.

Six days on, still no support, no access to a refund through Steam because I had played this game for more than two hours before the issue occurred, and all they do is send me back to [Ubisoft who ghost me and dozens if not hundreds of others](https://nz.trustpilot.com/review/www.ubisoft.com?stars=1) .

To take our money, give us a broken game we cannot use, and ghost us when trying to get any level of customer support is tantamount to theft.

I have filed a complaint against Ubisoft, with the New Zealand Commerce Commission, as I am fairly sure Ubisoft is [violating the Consumer Guarantees Act](https://www.consumerprotection.govt.nz/help-product-service/streaming-and-downloads/#:~:text=Digital%20products%20are%20covered%20by%20the%20Consumer%20Guarantees%20Act%20(CGA).%20Like%20all%20products%2C%20digital%20products%20must%20meet%20guarantees%20set%20out%20in%20the%20CGA%3A), which gives all New Zealanders the right to a refund, repair or replacement if a product they purchase is not fit for the purpose of which it was sold.

&#x200B;

**Call to action:**

If you, your friends or family have had any similar experience with Ubisoft, please post about it below. Give as much detail as you can; I hope we can gain enough attention to publicly embarrass Ubisoft into action.

&#x200B;

p.s. It's nice to see that the company that cannot find time to support paying customers can find time to downvote their customer's criticism!

I had gotten her the first game years ago and she liked it alot. So over the years I bought her AC2, Brotherhood, Revelations, (and apparently got a freebie of 3, but more on that later). But she never got around to finishing 1 at the time and now she was ready to go again. 

It started simply enough, I installed her disk of Assassin's Creed and away she went. She reached the end of the game and asked me to install the next one, so we sign into her Ubi account and there it is, AC2, and Brotherhood. But Revelations and 3 are both missing. I was concerned at first, but I decided to check my account instead. I've had this happen before where some Sims expansions were bought on MY account instead of hers, and EA moved them over with a simple phone call. Ubi should be at least as good, right?

Well, not so much. I call the Ubi support line, and apparently the phone agents can only help with accounts that can't be signed into. The agent was pleasant though, and opened up a ticket for me to complete so I could handle the issue with a live chat. A hair inconvenient, but not too bad. I completed the ticket with:

Me (8/7/2017, 11:38:22 PM): I no longer have them 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:38:39 PM): I see. Where did you purchase these games? 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:38:47 PM): I don't remember 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:38:51 PM): This was years ago 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:39:08 PM): It took her a REALLY long time to collect all of those flags in Assassins Creed 1 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:39:52 PM): OK. We do need a receipt to transfer a game. I will also let you know the only version of AC3 you have is the free copy from the 30th anniversary celebration that cannot be moved 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:40:46 PM): Why does it matter if I have a legitimate key/version and no longer need it for it to be moved to her account? I'm not asking for another copy opf the game. I'm asking that it be moved 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:41:10 PM): Since I have it, and it is registered, and it is legit, you shouldn;t need anything else 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:41:23 PM): I do apologize, but that is the requirement for moving the game 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:41:38 PM): That is a load of garbage

either

Me (8/7/2017, 11:43:07 PM): and they aren't fighting a hostile takeover by Guillemott 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:43:16 PM): THIS is how you lose customers

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:43:58 PM): One moment please 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:45:30 PM): I have verified that in order to move the game, we will need a valid proof of purchase, such as a receipt or invoice. If you do not have those, we cannot move the game. I do truly apologize for any inconvenience this may cause 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:46:07 PM): Why would you need a receipt when it is REGISTERED to my account? How else can you register a game to an account if you didn't buy it??? 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:46:25 PM): We require it to verify your purchase of the game from an approved vendor 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:46:36 PM): And after this chat I will continue to be able to play said game on MY account (which I don;t want to do) 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:46:57 PM): and will still be able to continue to receive apparently subpar support for it if I so choose 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:47:27 PM): And I don't care what you think of  whatever store I bought the game from 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:47:29 PM): That is what we will need to transfer the game. Is there anything else that I can assist you with today? 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:47:38 PM): Yes - move the game 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:47:44 PM): Or get me a manager who will 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:48:06 PM): No one else will move the game for you. If there is nothing else I can assist you with i will need to end this chat 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:48:34 PM): This is pathetic. It explains why you guys are doing so poorly though 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:48:58 PM): I am now boycotting future Ubi titles. Thanks for saving me future money 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:49:21 PM): I am very sorry you feel that way, but I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:49:39 PM): My day will be fine. I just need to log her into my account to play her game 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:49:53 PM): But I'm not purchasing any more Ubi games 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:50:01 PM): And I am telling everyone why. 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:50:24 PM): This was a simple customer service request, and you guys screwed it up. Congratulations 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:50:42 PM): I am sorry you feel that way, but this is the policy 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:51:03 PM): I would advise your corporate masters to rethink their policies 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:51:14 PM): I will absolutely forward your feedback 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:51:19 PM): Please do

You find a good formula and stick with it. Now I still highly enjoy some of these games -far cry 6 is one of my favorite games-, but it all starts to feel similar. I think you need to spend more time on planing the games, developing story’s, and finding ways to make the gameplay feel similar, but fresh. 

I know a huge game company won’t change anything because a dude on Reddit told them to. I’m just saying that so many of these games have a ton of potential that has been missed. We’re fans, we will wait a while for a better product. If it takes a few years for there to be a far cry 7, so be it. 

I think there is something to be said about the fact that many Indie developers are making some of the most popular games out. Because they have nothing to lose, so taking risks, well, isn’t very risky at all. These people are passionate about there products and as a result they turn out pretty good.

So it was fun party game for us and kids and I wanted them to have fun so I bought a physical copy for the Switch.

I accidentally clicked ""update"" and viola - me and my family can't play the game now. Upon launch the game is blocked by ""CREATE UBISOFT ACCOUNT AND START UBISOFT CONNECT OR ELSE"" bullshit, you can't go pass this screen, you can only exit the game now.

I tried to delete our family's savedata and installed software (I have a physical copy) so this is patch most likely, disable the internet connection, restart the Switch - no luck.

  
Even in Airplane mode the game won't launch and says - install an update, and if you do it now forces this monetization & spying crap, more to that if you actually connect with their DRM - it spams huge half-screen intrusive ""YOU ARE PLAYING OUR GAME, CHALLENGE COMPLETED"" in the menus, in the game, between the games, this is so fucked up!

Go to the official page, change my account info back to English, change my password to something random, and wait for it all to happen again, but this time I couldn't even log in. It appears that people other than me in different countries are able to login with my account without needing my 2FA code, and just straight up removing it and put it on their phone. So now I am locked out of MY account and guess what, ubisoft support won't help. All my games, gone. All my progress, gone. All of my hope for this company, gone.   


Yeah I'm pissed, but hey, maybe their login servers will go down so no one can login.

10/10 will get Fucked again by Ubisoft. At least EA gives me a good time.

1fs9fvm,noswag15,1727630181.0,Things that are not being talked enough about ubisoft's anti-consumer practices ? ,8,20,"I am a bit concerned about how this whole ubisoft fallout is going to play out. Not because I don’t think they deserve it which they absolutely do, but because the online discourse seems to be heavily focused on a few specific mistakes that they’ve been making. And while the things that are being talked about are things that need to be talked about, I am barely seeing any mention of issues like single player games requiring internet to play, the requirement to have a dedicated launcher that gets in the way of playing a game that I own in every possible way, the aggressive and borderline illegal pushing of stuff that requires gamers to spend more money to do even basic things on games that they’ve bought and already fully paid for, their employees asking gamers to be comfortable not owning games to name just a few.

I feel like ubisoft is finally waking up and starting to think about making amends but when no one talks about these deep rooted issues, I feel like the company is going to get the wrong (or insufficient) feedback/message and continue to fail. If I am being honest, I want them to succeed because they make some of my most favourite games but the way they’re doing it is clearly not working.

So I wanted to highlight a few things that \*personally\* irk me. I am sure there are more and some of the issues may not resonate with some and that’s fine. So in no particular order, these are the things that bother \*me\* (and I’m sure several other gamers).

Why does ubisoft lump every gamer into one category and treat us all like shit ? I get it Ubi, you’re a business and you need to make money and when you see people illegally acquiring your products, it might be disheartening so if you want to take measures to prevent or reduce that, by all means go ahead and do it, but can you please not make is so annoying that you end up discouraging people who actually want to buy and play the games ?

When I buy a single player game, I just want it to be installed on my machine and clicking on it should take me straight to the game. Why should I wait for the clunky and ugly launcher to show up an ugly black empty store page and have to stare at it till whatever checks need to be performed and then wait so long till I can actually get to the game’s menu. And especially when there’s an update to either the game or the launcher, I now have to wait even more and click yes to a bunch of UAC prompts and once everything is done, it forgets my login and I have to login every single time. I just want to play my single player game on my gaming handheld device but no .. I have to fumble with entering a long 20 character mix of numbers symbols and hieroglyphs on a tiny virtual keyboard to even get to the next stage. I could install password managers (which I obviously don’t want to on a gaming handheld) to make it easier but I still need to copy and paste the password.

Why can’t I just play the game offline? If a check needs to be performed, do it on some schedule and clearly show when the last check was done and how much longer I have before the next check locks me out. Give options for me to extend the verification by performing an adhoc check so that I can briefly connect to the internet during my travels and “top-up” my access. There are ways to implement validation checks while still maintaining good user experience for legitimate users but it saddens me that the company’s knee-jerk reaction is to implement aggressive checks at the cost of UX for the honestly majority of users. The verification checks themselves .. why do they have to be tied to ubisoft launcher at all ? Why not have a separate lightweight headless process that performs the checks in the background when the game is loading before the menu is shown ? Surely a company as large as ubisoft can figure out a way, right ?

Why is there no update on issues that plague existing games ? Does there have to be million games released in quick succession before the previous ones are even done ? I bought avatar frontiers of pandora and while the reception has generally been lukewarm, I absolutely had a blast playing and sunk around 100 hours in it. \*had\* being the keyword here because the game has suddenly stopped working and asks me to purchase the skybreaker DLC to even play the base game that I’ve already paid for. How is this even legal ? I wanted to give ubisoft the benefit of doubt and thought that this is probably a recently introduced bug that will quickly be patched but no .. looks like this issue is widespread and has been open for months and ubisoft knows about it but still there is no information about when or if it will ever be resolved.

Which brings me to the whole “forced updates” and lack of options to delay or deny updates. Games are software and software will have bugs no matter how well it’s implemented or tested but the audacity of ubisoft to think that they’re infallible, that their servers will never go down and that they will never have bugs when the reality is exactly the opposite is a clear indicator of some evil force within the company that’s acting against well meaning stakeholders. Because there’s no way that actual developers who slog day and night to create these games don’t know about these limitations and the gamers also know these because they face these routinely. So it looks like ubisoft’s management is absolutely out of touch and is in the middle of this whole mess because it’s pretty clear that the management made decisions to rush out unfinished products. Even worse is the complete silence and the way the company just shrugs it off as business as usual. No wonder people don’t trust ubisoft. Something drastically needs to change in order to win back the lost trust.

Why do I HAVE to login to a ubisoft account to play assassins creed on a playstation 5 ? It slowly crept in. First it was not required at all. Then an option to login was added but was not mandatory. Then with Valhalla, it suddenly became mandatory to login to a ubisoft account in order to play a game that I bought on playstation ? Why ? It got so annoying that eventually I caved and logged in, only to have a severely degraded experience. The game which was buttery smooth before on PS5 started to have micro stutters every now and then. Not to mention all the useless avenge quests bugging out and constantly bombarding the screen with crap like “XYZ has been slain. Avenge their death” or something along those lines. More filler padding on an already padded game just doing the same thing over and over again. It got to a point that I couldn’t do a single action in the game without the same “avenge” notification popping up with an annoyingly loud sound (I am talking like a notification every second type frequent). I dropped the game right there and never looked back. Why do I not have an option to say “no” to the forced login ? why can’t I just peacefully play the game (which I paid a premium for) in peace ?

Engage with the users more actively please ? Don’t treat users as cash cows to milk till death, eh ? Why not have an honest conversation like a reddit AMA or some channel that the company is comfortable with and take criticism constructively instead of gaslighting everyone ? Sure, there are always going to be people who take it too far with their criticism but the solution is not to assume everyone is like that and turn a blind eye. In fact, there’s so much backlash because there are so many problems and while some people may not know how to voice them properly, it’s absolutely important to listen to the ones that are willing to have a discussion and willing to provide feedback ? Why not be transparent when issues are reported by acknowledging them and giving routine status updates instead of leaving users hanging ? Isn’t that basic courtesy to show to people who have trusted the company enough to spend their time and money in ?

Do better Ubisoft.

P.S. I posted this on r/gaming but got removed saying I need to already be an active contributor on the sub to make posts so I'm trying my luck here. Hope I'm not breaking any rules (I have checked the sidebar).

TLDR; There is no perfect company and it's impossible to please everyone and every company inadvertently upsets a few of them but somehow ubisoft has managed to upset a vast majority of its consumers with a wide variety of issues but only the DEI and lack of polish are being talked about while the other issues are not being talked about enough.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fs9fvm/things_that_are_not_being_talked_enough_about/,2024-09-30 01:16:21
10gae8q,From_Gaming_w_Love,1674155689.0,Reflections of an angry gamer: How Ubisoft failed us AND shareholders.,6,3," Beating a dead horse here but one more plop on the pile can't hurt. I'm not meaning to lecture you guys and I know Ubisoft doesn't monitor this sub but I wanted to put this ""out there."" The internet has lots of room so here we go:

**TL:DR-** 

**1) Deliver the game you promise**

**2) Provide SOME measure of support for your products through their life cycle or AT LEAST as long as you're promoting it / selling it full price (cough- or putting it on gamepass)**

**3) Engage with the community in a genuine way**

**4) Preserve / Protect our progress like it matters**  
 

Gamers weren't always mainstream but now that we are and the time we spend consuming content is extremely valuable. If we estimated only 1% of the global population plays computer games roughly the 8.6 hour per week average, this is roughly 80 million people sitting down for almost 3/4 of a billion hours PER WEEK.  
 

The gaming industry is highly competitive and eager to shake all the money out of our pockets to sustain growth to what the google machine tells me will reach roughly 225 billion dollars in 2023. And we're usually more than happy to oblige them but it comes with a few very basic conditions: We want the game you promise, we want it to work, we want to feel as if our opinion matters and we want our progress to be preserved.  
 

Are any of these things impractical or unfair? I don't think so... I want to take a walk down memory lane with a few of you who have been around for awhile in hopes that maybe these reflections will put a spotlight on exactly how catastrophically Ubisoft missed the mark on ALL of them. I'll keep it basic since this is opinion based only but feel free to expand on the things that matter to you and the titles you play.    
 

**We want the game you promise: Underhype and overdeliver.**  
 Breakpoint is really the only experience I have here and even then most of what was promised was more through the association with Tom Clancy and Ghost Recon. With that comes a certain expectation of a ""gritty technomilitary shooter."" Breakpoint would have been fine if they'd just dumped the Tom Clancy / Ghost Recon association. So much of what made it a colossal failure was a complete disregard for that brand and the man behind it- they might as well have gone ahead and just called their recent boondoggle ""Tom Clancy Ghost Recon: Skull and Bones.""  
 

With the promises come claims of innovation and of course this comes with an element of risk- there was nothing innovative about Breakpoint... except that we ""were able to blouse our boots."" Feel free to blouse your hip waders Mr. CEO man as you wade through this ocean of \[censored\] you and your company have found yourself in.  
 

**We want it to work: Customer support for the win!**  
 In what I can only assume was a cost cutting measure, technical / customer support is among the worst in the industry. Ubi-Drones, for the most part, patrol the forums and social media hungry for opportunities to copy and paste often irrelevant instructions to deflect away from known but hidden issues. The debacle with Wildlands servers comes to mind... and to add insult to injury instead of acknowledging this they made it worse by expanding the reach of Wildlands to Gamepass- making the game almost unplayable for anyone. Ongoing promises to ""get the information to the team and get back if there are any developments"" are completely empty and a months long challenge for ANY drone to give a SINGLE example of where ""the team"" came up with a solution or relevant feedback on ANY Ghost Recon title over the last couple years has remained unfulfilled. Wildlands players were only able to keep playing since so many got frustrated by not being able to play they moved on to other titles... This left room for the rest of us to keep playing the game we continue to love.  
 

**We want to feel as if our opinion matters:** Engage the with the community who love your title!   
 Not everyone cares enough about what they play to ""put it out there"" but when folks weigh in on any number of platforms / forums / social media et al, it's with an enthusiasm that warrants some consideration. Of course it's not practical to expect a personal response all the time, but SOME sort of acknowledgement to the broader community messaging would go a long way. Ubisoft dumped years of passionate discourse when it converted over to this absolutely atrocious forum... This is- bar none- the worst forum I've ever been on and as a guy in this generation of gamers, gaming forums were pretty much a staple. You can keep your facebook and twitter trash... I come to the ""official forum"" with some expectations and the clunky, nonsensical layout and functionality of whatever you call this at the expense of all the conversations we've had specifically on the topic of trying to get Breakpoint off the rocks... it's just inexcusable.  
 

**We want our progress to matter: Don't delete our fucking stats!**  
 Maybe even worst of all- back in about May when (almost?) everyone had all their stats wiped in Wildlands and the answer was ""It's a legacy title so we can't do anything about it"" was maybe the biggest slap in the face for gamers- many of whom give themselves little challenges as part of the distracting element the game provides. The sense of accomplishment is palpable- especially to get through emotionally trying times like... oh I don't know- pandemics? So to have all of that progress thrown in the trash with no explanation or recourse is disgusting. Gamers will no longer trust that their progress matters and as a result will be less likely to invest time OR money into future Ubisoft titles until there is a high level commitment... lol nevermind. Even a high level commitment from the CEO is empty and meaningless. Not even sure why I'm wasting my time writing this- this entire mess can rest squarely on his shoulders. That management team sat on this problem and filled their pockets with our money while their little community cheerleaders ran around helping to cover it all up with fake promises or outright lies is disgusting- and THAT'S the taste we have in our mouths in consideration of ""Ubisoft.""  
 

And it's not just us- clearly this reputation... all of the complaining from all the gamers about all the titles speaks through record low sales and a company in financial crisis piloted by greedy rich people. You don't need to be a financial expert to recognize that Ubsioft- starting at the VERY top- got greedy and tried coasting to easy money on the backs of the passionate gaming community. Regaining that trust after such widespread disrespect for what gamers care about may -literally- be impossible given Ubisoft's immaculate track record for failing to deliver...

157gxsx,Rowindishere,1690124231.0,DO NOT BUY UBISOFT PRODUCTS,8,9,"Ubisoft does not deserve your money at all, we should stop buying their products and make them lose millions or even go bankrupt.
As you may have known, Ubisoft is suspending accounts on their launcher because of ""inactivity"" and they're using Ubisoft Connect to abuse your rights as a costumer, and most likely forcing you to log into their shitty service or else your account will be suspended and lose all access to games that YOU PAID FOR! It is a disgrace to see such a company doing such bullshit to their users, we should stop buying games like Rainbow Six Siege, Far Cry 6 or any of their products, and any YouTubers like Varsity Gaming and others that have a reputation in the community behind those games can also help in the cause if they want to, stop streaming or posting videos featuring their games.
I also recommend that you report announcement trailers of games that already came out, as they feature false advertising, the trailers are nothing like the final product (leave Far Cry 3 out since the game looks better than the trailer).

In defense of Rainbow Six Siege, they destroyed the fucking game, Today's R6S has no loyalty to the book it is supposed to be based of.
This game was supposed to be a SWAT simulator, like Ready or Not, it was NEVER supposed to be Fortnite, Valorant or a copycat of CS:GO.
It was supposed to be a REALISTIC TACTICAL SHOOTER AND ONLY THAT. 
This company is taking advantage of Tom Clancy's death to fuck his franchise, if he was still alive he wouldn't allow such bullshit to happen to HIS GAME, the developers have no idea what the fuck their doing to his game, stop listening to Pros and ESPORTERS for fucksake, they have no rule in the game's development. 
You guys need to stop waiting for the government to do something about the false advertising, the internet has no such thing as laws, Y O U HAVE TO DO SOMETHING NOT THE GOVERNMENT.
Either the CEO gets the fuck out of the company or they go bankrupt.

Please give me a moment to review your case. In the meantime, feel free to add any additional information that may pertain to your issue, and I will be with you shortly. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:18:53 PM): I tried signing up for the free trial of uplay+ a few days ago, and it still wont let me sign up. it puts me in a site loop. I was able to do it through the website, and add games to my account, but when I try downloading and playing them on the client it says my subscription has expired. clicking renew gives me another broken link 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:19:49 PM): Also it has charged my card twice, the 2nd time I tried resubscribing it told me there was a problem with my payment and it couldnt continue, even though it charged my card immediatley after that. and I still have no access 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:20:09 PM): Thank you for reaching out to us about this. The charges are an authorization request sent to your financial institution. These charges will drop in a few days. I apologize for any confusion caused by this. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:20:43 PM): Ok why did it charge me twice and then give me an error message the 2nd time saying it couldnt charge it, but did anyway 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:20:53 PM): also, i still have no access too my trail 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:21:14 PM): Additionally, we are aware of an issue affecting some subscribers where the subscription shows as expired when they have an active subscription.

 The developers are in the process of investigating the issue, and we hope to have a resolution in the coming days. 
Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:21:42 PM): You may have been charged twice as the system hadn't flagged you for having a subscription yet, and sent another authorization hold. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:21:59 PM): so that being said, is our trail time going to be extended? it seems alot of people are having this issue with no answers, also no way to cancel 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:22:26 PM): a month long trail isnt accurate when you dont have access too it  

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:22:59 PM): I understand your concern and feedback. We do not currently have any more information on this issue at this time, however we are working as quickly as we can to restore access to our subscribers. We appreciate your continued patience with this. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:23:48 PM): so if its not fixed for another week or 2, or at all...we basically are gonna lose the free trail time we were promised and with no way to cancel be charged for a service that dont work? 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:24:05 PM): seems kinda like a scam to me. a bit shady... 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:24:22 PM): I can understand why you would feel that way. We are working on making sure this does not happen and that we have access restored. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:24:24 PM): not good PR for a new service or as a publisher in general at the very least

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:24:33 PM): Did you have any other questions for us at this time? 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:24:55 PM): right but the issue is we are being charged for a free month long trial that isnt being delivered with no answers 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:25:18 PM): The authorization hold is a pending charge that will be refunded. I'm sorry that there was any confusion about this. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:25:42 PM): again, are we gonna be credited for this or is our trial gonna end and we are not going to get our full 30 days 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:26:13 PM): I do not have any information on potential compensation for this at this time. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:26:23 PM): if its not fixed for 2 weeks, does our month trial start when its fixed, or are we losing 2 weeks of a month trail due to an error on ubisofts part 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:27:24 PM): well the company staying silent and refusing to acknowledge is just making the situation worse. especially for an already high 15 a month. not a good 1st impression 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:27:53 PM): We are aware of this, and we are working to resolve this issue as soon as possible. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:27:57 PM): cant imagine many people continuing to support them, me included 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:28:42 PM): will we get an email once the service up? or do they plan on staying silent on that as well, hope people forget and then charge thier card on oct 1st 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:28:43 PM): Any updates on this ongoing issue will be posted to our support page and also the official forums.
 
Me (9/7/2019, 12:29:43 PM): How do I cancel to keep from being charged after this ""trial"" is over

Me (9/7/2019, 12:30:08 PM): it seems its impossible to cancel as well.  

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:31:17 PM): When service has been restored, we will be able to cancel this for you. As long as the cancellation is processed before October 1st, you will not be charged. Since this issue is preventing an active subscription from being on your account, you will not be charged. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:32:05 PM): I see I have an active service on the website, but not the uplay client however.  

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:32:32 PM): That's the issue we are trying to resolve. The website is showing an active subscription, but it is not active on our side. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:33:23 PM): so, it does show an active subscription on one end but not the other, so what would prevent it from being charged if its not resolved by the 1st 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:33:40 PM): Since we don't have a subscription on our end, you won't be charged. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:34:30 PM): As I said Ive already had 2 charges now on my card, a third will cause me to file a fraud report and chargeback with my bank 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:34:49 PM): I've mentioned before that the pending charges on your statements are authorization holds that will not finalize and will be refunded to you. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:37:21 PM): Ok. I guess I will wait to hear an official statement. If the company dont make good on this it will kill uplay+ before it starts. if our trial isnt extended thats false advertising and not gonna go over well with customers. And from what ive been hearing its already left a pretty bad taste in peoples mouths.  

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:37:41 PM): I'm sorry to hear that. We hope to have this resolved soon. In the meantime, I hope you enjoy your weekend!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/d0y9u8/my_experience_with_ubisoft_support_about_their/,2019-09-08 00:40:05

Maybe it's just me being stupid and can't find a fix for the said bug but still, all the other issues with servers and other games and yet, no fixes? I hope that the community agrees with me as much as my friends do, if not then it is what it is.

Final notes, instead of focusing on new content or games that won't really get big (\*cough\* skulls and bones \*cough\*), try fixing all the issues in your already existing games. It feels like a company this big shouldn't have to take this much time with larger issues in their big games.

So I figure that I should click Launch Ubisoft Connect... it launches to the CD Activation window and doesn't have the game in my library at all.

I then think the smartest of ideas is to submit a support ticket... so I go to Ubisoft's Support page and the page won't allow me to select which game I have my problem with, so the support page doesn't even work.

When you open Steam Page in this region it says ""**Purchases made in this region will only receive the Russian and Simplified Chinese languages**."".

 This is unacceptable, I don't want to play the game in any other language, other than English. Why doesn't Ubisoft at least make this version available for purchase in our region? We don't even have the option to pay more to get access to the original language and stuck with CN/RU instead.

There was a same issue with The Division, and Rainbow Six: Siege. Ubisoft is the only company that uses this practice of language locking. They don't seem to understand that Russian or Chinese may not be native language for everyone living in CIS/CN, some people might even just be here for work or other thing and not know the language at all. Or maybe some people just don't want to play in Russian.

There also doesn't seem to be any way around it AFAIK, as ""Global"" version wouldn't activate on RU/CIS account and vice versa. Not so ""Global"" anymore, huh?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/5tgrix/rant_russian_chinese_language_lock_xpost_from/,2017-02-12 03:01:26
sd3p6b,elegantsshadow38,1643195933.0,My thought on Watch Dogs Legion,5,5," 

1: Ubisoft was trying to cash in the Resistance craze that mainstream media was doing since 16 which by the time the game came out it was already over and the media wanted to move on.

2: People were complaining about Grinding. (speculation). Like since people were complaining about grinding in games and they just stripped the leveling and replaced it with the perk system. Had they kept the leveling and class system like had they did in E319.

3: They focus on the broken part of the game: Watch Dogs online is the worst. It seemed like they were copying on what took Rockstar nearly ten years the perfect and expected people to like it. From matchmaking and bugs. it was boring.

4: story: The story had so many holes I thought that the game came out in Ides of March. The story was disjointed and the only best was short and should have been the focus rather than whatever it was telling [This video tells it better](https://youtu.be/yRwNh_4WmII)

5: Covid: In between 2019 and 2021. The world stood still. The pandemic has slowed and killed a lot of things. In fact, this is the worst time than anything. So the game took a hit which rather than releases it the following year. they rushed it in hopes to beat Cyberpunk 2077. Had they released it in 2021 when things got a little better...the game would have been better off.

6: they just gave up while the game is buggy and unplayable: Ok I get not wanting to make DLC, but the game is still buggy and it ruins it for newcomers later on.

7: Ubisoft is facing a crisis: with workplace harassment and people leaving the company. It makes sense why the game is in the state it's in and will be till 2026 if ever.

Idealistic remedies  
Well, Ubisoft could have kept their support open and had some fixes here and there for people who haven't brought the game yet.

jvt093,SoulessPanic,1605619897.0,Do not use your credit card for Ubisoft+ | Legal complain inbound.,6,2," Let me start saying that this it doesn't matter if it's 15euros,500 or 5.000.It's about the illegal practise(this just seems plain scam) in this situation and no respect shown towards consumer.I have never seen something like this ever before, even with small companies nevermind huge corporations like Ubisoft.  


So like most of you, i paid for Ubisoft+ yesterday using my credit card. Got the invoice via e-mail, downloaded the game i wanted to play and then suddenly my account got suspended. I immediately contacted customer support and they gave me the link for the FAQ they have in the announcement and they told me that the funds are on hold from my financial institution(bank) and that it depends by them on when my money will be released. This seemed reasonable.  


Now the ""funny"" part. I went to my bank today to check on this. What they told me is that the funds are NOT on hold from their side but instead it's on hold till 6th of December(!) by Ubisoft. I asked them if i can cancel the transaction and they told me i can't until the funds are released by Ubisoft on 6th of December.  


I contacted customer support again and after calling on their lies he told me to provide them with some information from my side(bank transaction, last card numbers etc.) and that he would forward this to Ubisoft+ team for further investigation. Of course, he told me he cannot provide with timeframe for response from Ubisoft+ team.  


Now, in their FAQ they state :  


""While this request is processed, the funds are not transferred to Ubisoft, but put on hold. This temporary hold is cancelled daily by Ubisoft, though it may take more time for your financial institution to release the funds back to you. They will be able to give you more information about authorisation holds policy.""  


Simply put what they state on the FAQ are NOT true as i described above. The temporary hold has not been canceled and my bank cannot release the funds back to me.  


Now, i spoke with my lawyer and he told me that if Ubisoft do not release the hold or provide me with the subscription i payed for until the end of the day we can form a legal complain through the bank. I am also waiting for the respone from Ubisoft+ team.  


This situation is outrageous and unaccaptable.  


I will provide the transcipts with the contacts i had with customer support. PLEASE DO NOT DELETE, ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION HAVE BEEN BLANKED OUT.

Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:25:04 PM): I understand that you have been charged for Ubisoft+ but the subscription is suspended?  


Me (11/16/2020, 9:25:56 PM): Hello, yes that's the case. I purchased it got the receipt downloaded the game and then it was suspended. I checked my bank records and money was transfered  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:26:58 PM): Upon investigating the subscription, I have to inform you that there is no processed payment in our system. The charges visible in your payment account are on authorisation hold from the payment provider.  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:27:45 PM): These charges should be temporary and the funds will be returned back to your payment account once released. For an accurate time frame on when the funds will be released, I kindly advise you to contact your payment provider/bank.  


Me (11/16/2020, 9:28:30 PM): Okay, but can you tell why the transaction wasn't completed. Do you require to have more than 15.00EUR in the credit card for it to pass the transaction ?  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:29:43 PM): The issue might be caused by many factors, I suggest to check the billing details for special characters, as they could cause this issue.  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:30:04 PM): The subscription is 14,99 Euro, if you have 15 it will be enough.  


Me (11/16/2020, 9:30:15 PM): I've seen many people suggest to do it with PayPal, do you think it would be better ?  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:31:19 PM): If possible, I do suggest to try with another payment method as that has helped with similar issues.  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:31:33 PM): If you are adding a another payment method, please also select it as default.  


Me (11/16/2020, 9:31:48 PM): Last question, is it possible to pay via Revolut ?  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:33:25 PM): All available payment options are listed on the checkout page, if the option for Revolut is not shown it might cause this issue.  


Me (11/16/2020, 9:34:10 PM): Okay, i will wait to get the funds back and try again. Thanks for the assistance.  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:34:55 PM): Happy to help! Should you have questions or need assistance, feel free to contact us again. I wish you a wonderful day!

Ubi-Cbraskov (11/17/2020, 1:53:58 PM): From what I understand you have paid for Ubisoft+ and not received the service.  
Me (11/17/2020, 1:54:22 PM): Indeed, i paid for it. Got the receipt, downloaded the game and then it was suspended.  


Ubi-Cbraskov (11/17/2020, 1:56:38 PM): OK, after checking your account I can see that the payments have failed. Please find our article below regarding failed payments:

Me (11/17/2020, 1:58:43 PM): That is confirmed by my bank, the funds are NOT holded by the bank, can you explain that to me please ?  


Me (11/17/2020, 1:59:13 PM): And are on hold till the 6th of December !  


Me (11/17/2020, 2:00:37 PM): This request appears as an authorisation for roughly the same amount as your subscription. It is an important step to protect our customers. While this request is processed, the funds are not transferred to Ubisoft, but put on hold. This temporary hold is cancelled daily by Ubisoft, though it may take more time for your financial institution to release the funds back to you. They will be able to give you more information about authorisation holds policy.  


Me (11/17/2020, 2:00:43 PM): This is from the FAQ  


Me (11/17/2020, 2:02:24 PM): It says the temporary hold is cancelled daily by Ubisoft, and it says that my bank is responsible for returning the funds back to me. Which is not the case since tha bank told me they are on hold from Ubisoft side.

Over the past week, I have had the worst experience with Ubisoft customer support.  Honestly, and objectively, it has been worse than I have ever received from any other venue, let alone a major company like Ubisoft.  I have never felt so undervalued as a consumer in my life.  I have found a myriad of posts here (and other places) from other people who have had similar experiences.  

For clarity, I am not some angry jerk who is simply angry because they didn't see things my way.  Honestly, I have no idea how they saw things, as they just stopped talking to me altogether.  Just a complete lack of communication from their end, even when I contacted them again, politely asking for any kind of update or direction on how my case was being handled.  I found this particularly infuriating as I could see where my case had been ""updated"" each time they logged on to read my comments, but no response or update was given.  Truly, I would've been fine had they just said ""we are not going to be fixing your issue"".  That would've at least been something...

This is not how you treat people, Ubisoft.  After 168 hours, I closed my own case having received no support or answers at all, leaving only the message that I did not intend to purchase any more games from this company until some sort of paradigm shift happens within their support practices.

1djaa6o,goal_dante_or_vergil,1718770354.0,"Reminder: the Creative Director for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Jonathan Dumont, was directly named as a sexual abuser by female Ubisoft employees in 2020. Instead of being punished, he was instead rewarded by being made Director.  ",2,38,"I have a feeling that this whole debacle about the black Samurai, Yasuke, is just a way for Ubisoft to deflect attention away from the fact that the Creative Director for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Jonathan Dumont, was directly named as an emotional and sexual abuser by female Ubisoft employees in 2020. 

Dumont has been accused of “verbally abusing and making sexual advances toward his colleagues, particularly women and new starters.”

A report from Game Developer into alleged abuse Ubisoft found that Dumont was, according to multiple sources, ""abusive and controlling"" and ""one of the biggest offenders"" at the company. The workers who spoke to Game Developer claim that Dumont would throw objects, punch walls, and be verbally abusive, using slurs that would reduce his targets to tears. He was even said to tell women how they should dress.

""[He] pushes people to the edge of their mental health regularly, and tries to justify his behavior by saying 'this is how you get things done.'"", said a source speaking to the publication. ""[He makes] various misogynistic and homophobic comments, and when he's called out on them will come out with defenses like 'my mother left my father when she realized she was a lesbian, so I know what I am talking about.'""

“Dumont has been responsible for many developers leaving Ubisoft altogether, due to his alleged outbursts “creating a climate of fear.”

""Dumont has been the reason [for] multiple of my colleagues leaving,” the A Better Ubisoft member tells us. “Be it because of sexual advances, belittlement, fear of him, or having seen his behaviour when in a bad mood. His outbursts have created a climate of fear known for years in the studio and failed to be acted on for a long time.”

The source also shares that while Dumont has made an effort to “improve himself”, his alleged past actions “are still very fresh in the mind of many”. As a result, “some in the Quebec studio have asked not to work on Red because of his position on the project.""

This seemingly contradicts Ubisoft's recent claims at a briefing in Paris this Thursday. ""Yes, we stumbled. And we have acknowledged that,"" said Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. ""We learned a lot along the way, and have made meaningful progress with concrete action plans.""

In a statement to TheGamer, Ubisoft provided another response from Guillemot, stating that anyone who was accused of abuse but remains at the company has been ""appropriately disciplined.""

1dlwxql,Tank2B-1986,1719066578.0,Reconsider Watchdogs,4,15,"

I have been a long fan of Ubisoft games, from the old-school Assassin Creed games to the classic Prince of Persia. I have been very impressed by how the team has pushed forward into one of the most world-renowned video game companies in the gaming business. To that, I have run across articles stating Ubisoft's intention to table quite a few games in order to focus on a large abundance of Assassin Creed games. Now, don't get me wrong, I can comprehend the need to put some things on hold to focus on others. It is a respectful way of approaching tasks so you can get the level of polish necessary to increase the level of success. I just believe that Ubisoft is tabling, indefinitely, Watch Dogs at a time when I think the gaming community could use this intellectual property.

I have played all three Watch Dogs and truly fell in love with the series starting with Watch Dogs 2. The approach to WD2 was not only an attractive packaging but it also captivated a lot of fun to the gaming loop. With every minute I played WD2, I found myself torn between making money from doing side missions so I could dress up my main character and forwarding the story which had me laughing from one adventure to another. It was, in my opinion, a very long game, but it was nothing like the Assassin Creed games of late. Honestly, that is another reason why the game was so approachable. The world that was created for WD2 just seemed to be a very decent blend that resulted in such a satisfying conclusion that had me waiting for Watch Dogs 3. Of course, everything can't always be good and I acknowledge that there aren't any games that I have come across that I'd consider perfect, so my constructive criticism is warranted.

One of the biggest issues with WD2 is the single playable character. To me, Ubisoft crafted such fun and loveable characters that it was a shame that we didn't get a chance to take them out in the field. The story was focused on DedSec's adventure and expansion of their popularity, which makes sense. I just think we could have had a chance to expand the gamer's attachment to these characters so that they hold more of an impact on the story as we scurry to the conclusion. In my opinion, it may seem minor, but in regards to the story, I can't help but hold interest in the members who were already established. Especially after finalizing the DLC. That would have been the perfect moment to allow us to play as our favorite DedSec members.

My other gripe wasn't anything apparent to me until I was highly engrossed in Watch Dogs 3. That gripe was the limited animation that Marcus had at his disposal. Marcus was such a capable fighter with his unbreakable ball and rope, but from the tutorial of the game to the final mission, your takedowns, and attacks seemed far too limited. It isn't all doom and gloom because the parkour animations are outstanding and even though they greatly fixed in Watch Dogs 3, they didn't carry over the parkour animation to WD3.

Nothing could extinguish my excitement for the next chapter in the newly established DedSec community and for everything I was excited about, it didn't disappoint. The intro to Watch Dogs 3 was exceptional. The agent that we had at our disposal introduced us to the controls but also introduced us to the animation takedowns that would fuel every minute of my time in this game. This inspired me to play through the game not just once, or twice but three times and still play to this day. I feel that Ubisoft has crafted a world and scenario that was grounded in realism with a sprinkle of sci-fi technology that made players feel capable but not unstoppable.

I could probably write another page about the animations alone but I want to just
commend the dedication in allowing the animators to fully approach all the game's animation with such fluidity and artistic flare. The game does something rare that other games don't and that is rewarding players who test outside their comfort zone and discover all the other characters who have unique capabilities or skills. The silence of the nail gun, the defibrillator, the sledgehammer, and even a hypnosis pendant all make each character feel unique and a joy to use. Hand-to-hand combat had a fun yet challenging rock-paper-scissors aspect to it and the gunplay in the game wasn't perfect but fit the character's skill level for most people since they weren't all mercenaries who had experience with weapons.

The story does take hold of your emotions once you start to unravel how DedSec is being weaponized to further the agenda of multiple bad actors. More so, the betrayal that is revealed truly motivated every one of my following mission success so that we can get back at this person whom we trusted. Again, ending the story left me in the same place as WD2 did; anticipating the next approach to the DedSec situation.

Just like WD2, WD3 isn't immune to constructive criticism. I love the game but the running animation was a bit awkward in my opinion. Especially in comparison to Marcus and his parkour capabilities. It just seemed like something that could have been duplicated from WD2 or executed better. It was nothing game-breaking but it felt like a step backwards from WD2.

I also think the limitation of weapons being used dependent on the recruited person was
warranted and a bit annoying. Let me explain what I mean. The secret agent, who had a silenced pistol, probably would have training in multiple weapons. I am ex-military and we may have had an assigned weapon, but we still touched a lot of the other weapons the military uses. In my opinion, I would have allowed them to use other weapons that others had at their disposal. Maybe making the Hitman or Agents rarer to find or more difficult to recruit. I also think you could have had a leveling system for each person you recruited, unlocking weapons and skills as they gained experience. This would have
been a challenging task for your team but the reward would have outweighed that work. Every takedown, headshot, and escaped alert would fuel those levels and unlock other things for this player. Even allowing some sort of customization to each character you have recruited increases the hurt the player felt when this person was killed in action.

Honestly, those are the main things that I felt could have truly been enhanced. Maybe adding a few more gadgets for our use would have been acceptable as well, but that can be something I look forward to in the next Watch Dogs. Speaking of such, I have a lot of ideas on the direction you could go with this next game if you ever get around to making it. 

The first thing I don't want you to do is jump deeper into sci-fi. As I stated above, the blend Ubisoft has come up with in WD3 was perfect. Cloaking, armored enemies, and drones that attack and pursue our characters are great obstacles for a game like this. We can always push this a tad bit further by adding a limited exo-suit enemy and attacking mechanical animals that can also cause each mission a bit of a headache. Obviously, this will have to be offset by more animation and tactical weapons and tools to neutralize these threats. I have faith that Ubisoft will be able to add these and other additions that don't usher the world, that has been built, into a ""Star Wars"" type realm.

I would love for Ubisoft to bring back the recruitment that was added in WD3. Just expand the occupations that the random generator is allowed to toy with and add the aforementioned leveling system so that they can start as a street mime who can only use an electric gun and get to be a capable DedSec member who can learn an artistic takedown or have tech that can EMP the entire block. Do add the ability to fully make your character the way you want, even if that means adding a character customization generator so that you can have one person, probably your first DedSec member, whom you can truly build up and design. Perhaps give that character a longer leveling up pathway who can truly be an omega agent but still require an occupation to start the character creation. If he is imprisoned, that's where your recruited members come into play. Require that he be rescued and dependent on the severity of the crime, meaning the number of stars that were accumulated before the arrest, will dictate how difficult the mission is to recover our agent. 

Vehicles in the game were serviceable but maybe add other unique modes of transportation. Skateboards seem silly but could be fun. Especially if you add that into the takedowns. Rollerblades, bikes, jet skis, and even unlockable hoverboards would be extremely interesting and add enough technology that doesn't remove the grounded feel that has been established. Weapons would fall into this as well. I would love to see an agent who is a sushi chef have the ability to do knife takedowns and knife throws for silent distant takedowns. Maybe just limit his overall weapon capability initially until he levels up enough to expand what he is capable of using.

Ubisoft was great at linking each WD to one another and I wouldn't stop doing that with the fourth edition either. Maybe have missions that mention other members of DedSec and even allow them to accompany you on specific missions. I know that could be asking a lot but it would truly set the game apart from other Ubisoft games. Even if you are just allowing them to join our character in main missions initially, it would still be amazing to have Marcus testing our skills or Aiden being our mentor. The real showstopper of linking IPs to WD was the Assassin's Creed crossover. Not only was it written very well, but it also used the London setting of past Assassin Creed to justify the existence of the location which placed the events of Assassin Creed Syndicate in the same world as WD. I think this could be pushed further with another crossover with WD and Assassin Creed and try crossing over Division, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, or even Raving Rabbids (Rabbids would be ideal for clothing designs and movie posters).

The level design for WD games is phenomenal and if you can keep that consistsstent, it will continue to be great. Not sure what location would be ideal, but I'd contemplate creating another city like was done with London, or creating a chain of islands that could allow us to have different experiences in different locations. Regardless of locale, consider expanding the headquarters for DedSec and adding some minor customizations like items you pick up or mission-specific rewards. Maybe a place where you can see all the legendary masks hanging from the wall. More interior locations would be welcome and have the player's character be able to interact with the outside environment from the interior environment. Adds a level of emergence and gives you a little more capability against the Al as they ascend on our masked player who is attempting to avoid arrest.

Co-op in the main storyline would be much appreciated but never required. Most of the time, co-op through the main story tends to make the game a lot easier to get through because you can rely on another person to revive you or guide you through the game. To counter this, up the difficult level by one when another person is added. I can imagine it will be surprising to think you can just run around hacking and killing without any strategy just because you have a friend join your game. WD is a game about planning and stealth, with the ability to go tactical when things go chaotic. Let's embrace that factor and emphasize the need to continue using your technological tools and strategic thinking.

Weapon customization should be added as well. I love changing the designs of my weapons but adding a few sights, or under barrel attachments would further flush out the gameplay. Adding a leveling function to the all the games weapons would also be outstanding. Customizing the knives, brass knuckles, and whatever else is decided on to be used would be very attractive to gamers. Reaching into the creativity to even create other tools that can be used, and customized. I would have loved to have
had a parachute with the DedSec logo on it. I spent a lot of time utilizing the construction drone that our character could ride, that I started thinking of ways to approach missions in unusual ways. Adding the approach from above would further the approach to missions. Floating in from above, dropping on top of a lookout with that takedown animation from above would be a perfect way to start some of those missions.

Honestly, I was motivated to do this because of the article I read saying that there is another Ghost Recon being created. I welcome another Ghost Recon game, especially since it was one of the first games I played way back in the day. However, I wanted to point out the potential that exist with an IP that was easily shelved. We look at the sales and the critics and tend to feel that it is a waste to take another risk on an IP that hasn't found its footing quite yet in the gaming world. Monster Hunter was the exact same way but Capcom kept pressing forward and their hard work was finally rewarded by increasing sales by roughly 17 million. Ubisoft is one of the most talented gaming companies in my lifetime, and WD is an IP I desperately want to see succeed. I just think that shelving WD indefinitely could set it back especially at a time where I believe the world could us a game that attempts to bring justice to the games society by shining a light on the corruption that we are seeing in our real life.

I truly do hope this message finds each person willing to read it well and that it gives Ubisoft a chance to think and see that fans, not just me, are passionate about this IP. 

Take care, stay blessed, and good luck with the future.

What you need to do a story on his how a huge company like ubisoft can charge their loyal customers who preorder their game 2x as much as non pre orders and then not only not get them the game on the release date but not even respond with answers to customers they scammed ..normal people can call ubisoft and they don't responded when you open their claims..here is my wifes example....I still have no access ...........


 I preorder the game spent 125.00 on a special exclusive package for my husband's birthday bc he was a huge fan he owns EVERY title. You sold me a extra shipping guarantee for 25.00 MORE so I could be sure he could play it on. His birthday yesterday morning I was email a label creation for his present. As of today its still sitting somewhere on a desk the tracking shows it not even being dropped off yet. So today he is sitting watching others playing a game I pre-order him months ago and paid almost 2x the amount people are paying today to download and enjoy bc they we smart enough to buy into your EXCLUSIVE PRE-ORDER.  And on top of everything else I can't tell him anything about his present because your joke of a non existing customer service department won't even respond. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND HONESTLY SEEMS MORE LIKE A SCAM!! HE OWNS 6 TITLES SO SAYING WE WERE LOYAL CUSTOMERS IS A UNDERSTAMENT!! I DONT HAVE THE A EXRA 100 BUCKS TO BUY THE DIGITAL VERSION TODAY SO HE COULD AT LEAST SALVAGE SOME OF HIS BIRTHDAY HES BEEN WAITING FOR MONTHS AND I HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE SOMEWHERE TO GET OFF THEIR ASS AND PUT IT IN THE MAIL STILL THIS IS LIKE A BAD JOKE...SOMEONE GIVE US INFORMATION AT THE LEAST.

I restored my email, returned all game accounts, except for the Ubisoft account that I had since 2011.

And they don’t care that the real owner writes them and asks them to return the account to the mail before the hack. The real owner of the account is politely sent, saying that there is nothing they can do to help, even if they provide the information requested by support.

**According to ubisoft support, whoever has access to mail from the account at the moment is the owner (and they only check for the current email that is currently linked to the account).**

Not in Steam, not in Epic Games, there is no such problem with returning a stolen account, if you write what happened and ask to return the account to your email before the hack and provide some data.

**Conclusion one - Ubisoft support covers scammers!**

e2is35,Need_solutions,1574873490.0,Ubisoft takes money for the games that do not work,3,1,"  

Hey everybody, 

so I have a situation with Ubisoft, which they do not want to resolve at all and I would appreciate any help that I could get. 

I bought Heroes VII and I wanted to play it online with my friend. Unfortunately, it is not possible - there is a bug after bug and we have tried all the options that we found. We opened the ports, tried all the other suggestions, but there was always ""out of sync"" error. If not this, there are other errors, like corrupt autosaves that do not load or game stuck after a battle, game stuck after buying a caravan, killing a hero, etc. Half of the time we spent figuring out how to solve it, though it is not possible and I have asked Ubisoft to refund me my money + my ubisoft credits that I used to get a discount for buying this game (20 % discount for 100 credits). I am absolutely disappointed in Ubisoft for apparently stopping to support this game and still selling it, even though there are tons of bugs and it is not possible to play it online or via lan (we have tried both options) without having to stop and spend many hours to load the game again. 

There are bugs in game engine itself. It is not a connectivity issue and ports, since we have tried turning off the firewall, playing on other computers, also playing on the same network in LAN, using same VPN network that automatically connects us and removes the port problems, etc. In short, it is a known issue without real solutions.

Their response is always the same: ""no refund is possible because you have waived your withdrawal right, by downloading and playing the game."" It’s even more difficult because every time I get a different person dealing with my claim in support. Obviously, I understand their policy, though not in this particular case. The same way I can acknowledge that they have a right not to refund me when I download the game and just want to return it for no reason (obviously if I just play the game and want to return it, it would not be a correct behaviour and they have a right to deny it), they must acknowledge my right to buy the game that works, that is, Ubisoft is responsible not to sell unworking games and take money for them - this is outrageous and scandalous for such highly reputable company. I have a right to ask for a refund if the game engine is broken, that is, I got a product of inoperable quality. Besides, half of that ""time I played"", I used trying to find solutions to the problems.

They asked me to make some videos that prove I have the mentioned issues – I did it, spent my time to play the game even when I knew I will not be able to finish it. And after that, just if nothing happened at all, they didn’t even react to those videos. All I got was the same response:” Our investigation team replied to us with further information regarding your case. I need to inform you that we are unable to process your refund request as you have already started and played the game.“

And that’s all. Ubisoft takes your money, doesn’t solve the problem, asks many questions and proofs, don’t react to them, every time gives you a different specialist to deal with your support ticket, and copies the standard sentence, which is always the same and has nothing to do with your particular situation. The money I paid for the game and the amount of refund is not the main issue, but to sell the games that don't work and to say that it's my own fault that I waived my right after downloading the game, is simply outrageous. 

I would appreciate any help that you could offer, or may this post at least make you aware with what’s happening – better to buy games from Steam or some other game selling platforms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/e2is35/ubisoft_takes_money_for_the_games_that_do_not_work/,2019-11-28 00:51:30
cw484a,Gr1mTheReaper,1566911327.0,Ubisoft gets so much unfair hate!,4,13,"You can have your own personal opinion about this company, and that’s fine. I, myself absolutely LOVE these people. They’ve made my favourite game franchises (far cry, splinter cell, Assassin’s Creed, just to name a few) and I praise them constantly. I had more fun with AC Origins than I have with any other game. I understand that the biggest issue with Ubisoft is the micro transactions in Odyssey at the moment. Apparently, EXP is difficult to obtain and people think they are forced to spend real-money on EXP boosts. I have never found this to be the case. Do I support Ubisoft for putting micro transactions into their game? Absolutely not! What I will say is that those who believe they are pressured into buying in-game boosts are finding a way to cave-in. Has anyone ever thought that maybe, just maybe, obtaining EXP is supposed to be difficult, that way you can experience more of the game and feel the sweet feeling of increasing your level? 

Another criticism is the exploitation of the story creator tool. Ubisoft goofed this up a bit, but the backlash is much too harsh. So was Ubisoft’s response. They never should have swung the ban-hammer. Single-player games like AC should be played and modified to the consumer’s content, but if Ubisoft did not want this exploitation, they should have never implemented a flawed system in the first place.

Anyway, for all your mistakes, I love you Ubisoft. Please continue to make your wonderful games!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/cw484a/ubisoft_gets_so_much_unfair_hate/,2019-08-27 21:08:47

To then find out that it was a bug in the game and that i would have to reboot the game and lose my hours of progress.

You guys suck.

I just wanted to say that you suck.

I will no doubt put this game away for a few weeks/months and check back later if the bug was fixed and that I can then continue the story without losing my progression. But know that I will be telling people ubisoft is a shit company that doesn't care about its paying customers.

Anyway, I have completed the portion of your game that us available to me within 10 hours. It was fun and kinda cute going up against characters recommended for lol 200+ while I am bearly at lol 3. But I have finished everything available to me.

rdvgxb,Ricco95,1639211749.0,AC Odyssey transfer to DX 12,3,0,"AC Odyssey is known for its erratic resource management, which increases the load on processors and reaches 100% even on the most powerful configurations. Why did you Ubisoft the last couple of updates to the game, did not think to transplant the game to the DX 12 API, but only added cosmetics like the Ezio and Viking costume, as well as minor minor fixes. many companies and developers are moving their old games to new graphics APIs for better performance. Example: Rene classic DX 11 and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice DX 12. You are a large company and don't do anything to improve the performance and optimization of your games after the end of the so-called official support. It is also logical that after the end of this period, people should stop playing these games and switch to new ones, but this does not happen. you should also stop selling these games in favor of new ones, which also does not happen, but at the same time you do not seek to improve the gaming experience of people who bought your games, they should do it themselves with the help of third-party fixes, although it will not be difficult for you to fix it. you could fix the AC 3 Remastered with its poor models and lack of dynamic lighting. I don't think it's that difficult for you. You could fix the wrong kernel load in AC Ezio Trilogy for the new OS. But all I hear in response to complaints is ""Support for old games has been discontinued"", then everyone should stop buying them, because their gaming experience will not be as pleasant as stated. it's a shame to see how simple indie studios value their players and provide them with the best experience despite the release date of their game. unlike AAA companies with a million-dollar fortune. it was a little longer than I expected to write, but these problems are taking place.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/rdvgxb/ac_odyssey_transfer_to_dx_12/,2021-12-11 16:35:49

A week ago I saw that Ubisoft announced their Friend Referral Program. On their site in Russian version it was written that if you bring 1 friend you will receive ""Black Raven"" **pack**. If you don't speak Russian, I've made several screenshots where it's shown that it's called just the same way as the pack for 1500 Helix Credits.

I asked a friend to use my referral link and buy the game. Imagine my surprise when the next day I received only one skin for Sunin!

I submitted a ticket (#17540957), but 5 days have passed and still no response.

Later I checked and found out that in English version they promise only 1 Black Raven (without the word ""set"") but if I knew from the start that they give only the single miserable skin I wouldn't bother at all asking friends to buy the game. As far as I can see, at the time of this thread, they are still promising this set for one referred friend: [https://referral.ubisoft.com/assassinscreedvalhalla/ru-RU](https://referral.ubisoft.com/assassinscreedvalhalla/ru-RU)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/zxnio5/false_advertising_by_ubisoft/,2022-12-29 06:44:01

jow989,lucian2302,1604628420.0,speculation on ubisoft+ payment problem,3,2,"so this may be public knowledge for some people but here is some info on the Ubisoft+ payment system, also sorry if this has been posted here already. 

DISCLAIMER : I DONT WORK FOR UBISOFT IN ANY WAY AND I DO NOT CLAIM TO KNOW HOW UBISOFT PAYMENT SYSTEM WORKS IM JUST GOING OF THE INFO ON THE FORUM AND SOME PERSONAL EXPIRIENCE SO THIS IS JUST SPECULATION 

forum source : 

https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/2160230-*READ-FIRST-BEFORE-POSTING*-Help-us-help-you!

First thing, Sorry for my English, it's not my first language and I'm not really in the mood for grammar checks right now.

Like many people I got myself a Ubisoft+/uplay+ subscription, and like also a lot of people my subsctiption got ""suspended"", now fortunately I did not have the money in my account to pay the damn thing twice like some others have so that's a good thing.

Now why did my ubisoft+ subscription get suspended.

Well, that's complicated,  I dont think its a scam like many people say it is, although it may seem like one. Truth be told, this seems to me more of a case of incompetence that straight up malice, which in a way perfectly describes Ubisoft.

So let's get to the core of the problem which is of course Ubisofts payment system, form what I have gathered form the forum the thing functions like this:

""When you sign up for UPLAY+ we send an authorization request to ensure your payment method is valid. While the request is processed, the funds are not transferred to Ubisoft, but put on a temporary hold. This hold is cancelled daily by Ubisoft, but it may take more time for your financial institution to release the funds. For more information on how your financial institution handles holds, please reach out to them"".

So that means that Ubi does not just take your money like any normal service, they actually take the money and put it on hold as a way checking that your payment method is legit. Then once a day they just clear the money automatically, this has one problem which is that your bank will probably not have cleared the payment yet (mine takes 5 days to do it), so Ubi just assumes that something went wrong on your end and suspends your subscription

now other companys do this, iv heard that paypal does a similar thing, but the thing is that most of the companys dont hold the entire payment not to mention that this is a subscription service that does not garantee imideate acces which is ridiculous. 

Then comes the fun part, since your subscription automatically resets as a default, and the system dose not make the difference between a suspended subscription they just reset it automatically.

So this explains most problems like double payments and subscriptions randomly getting suspended. 

Now I do believe that you end up getting your money back sience it just ends up on hold again, but that can vary, as for the double payments, since i have not been trough it I cant really comment on it but it seems like it can easily loop and drain your account . 

Ubisoft shold probably change this since this system just does not work for a subscription based system, but since they have keept it for a year now, it does not look like is going to change

But how do we fix it, well in my case I can  see my money being held on my bank app so I can probably just call them to clear it but it may vary for other people. I haven't tried yet since its 3 am where I live, but ill keep this post updated with my findings.

Finally, just to say that even though this info was on the forums I feel like Ubi should make this stuff more clear since I had to search for hours. 

Also they should fix the support page, it's honestly ridiculous not to be able to even post a ticket there

Hope this helped someone, and I wish everyone luck on their magical journey trying to use/refund this service :)

\----

The payment was made on the 9th, ie the amount fell into the block and is waiting to be written off by Ubisoft. But the request to write off comes incorrectly and therefore the amount cannot be written off. In this case, from the moment of payment on the 11th day, the amount will leave the block and return to your balance, and the payment will disappear from the statement. Or Ubisoft will be able to write off funds correctly

Its Privatbank, Ukraine.

   
In general, I have never encountered payment problems like this with Ubisoft. No company in the world charges an amount twice. Google, online stores usually write off $ 1 for verification and return it IMMEDIATELY.

hr7gua,doomslayerislife,1594752880.0,assassins creed: freedom,3,0,"
this game will be updated over time over the course of the assassin’s creed seires of games as they come out and new things will be updated in the way rainbow six siege is updated but in a little bit of a different way.

1.the story 
the story will start off in the modern day as a new character name james who gets recruited by the assassins to learn the last location of a missing piece of eden that used to be in rome but ended up going missing.

as you head into the amius you create your assassins character as the amius doesnt know which person is the right person a bit like odyssey where it couldn’t really figure out which character it was so it lets you create one instead.

the first chapter starts off in rome and slowly makes it way up to the modern day as each chapter will be in a existing place that the assassins creed games took place such as london or america or on the seas like black flag and such up until the very end of the game when you find the piece of eden and hide it as to make sure the templars dont find it.

the story will be fully playable with up to four friends or by yourself each mission will be playable with everyone and in all sorts of ways going from the assassin way of being quiet to going loud and fast at the end of the game you will unlock full freeroam across each map as at the end they will be all connected on a way as when ever you pass over to each area it will change you in to the clothes you were wearing at the time and the weapons you were using.

after completing each chapter you will get a special weapon for that area for you to use it in once you have completed the game as well as at the end of the game a weapon to use in all of the areas same as clothing as well.

2.assassins creed online 
this will be the part that gets updated when ever a new game in the seires comes out as new eras with the map from that game will be added as well as missions like gta online such as missions like heists and other things.

when you start you pick a faction you can work for or make your own here are the different options to pick from:

1.the assassins/ the hidden ones 
2.the templars/ the Ancient one
3.a neutral faction such as cops or law enforcement in each era 
4.your own faction you can start out but this will be unlocked after working for one of the main factions already in the game and once you have gotten to a specific level

over time alot like siege updates will be added when ever a new game comes out to add a new area such as if they make a new game set in japan with samurais and ninjas.

the game will be ported or remade for new consoles until the assassins creed seires is over as updates will span over the course of the seires lifespan and it will add lots of new things to it over time.

during the game you can buy business and do missions like heists as i said like gta 5 but in a different way when ever you get specific things done for it income will come through other players who buy stuff from your companys as well as if your faction is doing well in the area your in as the businesses you own will be effected in different ways from stuff happening in the world.

heist missions or what ever ubisoft would call them will be alot like gtas stuff but in a different way a bit like story you will see characters such as eive and jacob ezio and alot of others including the ones youu have help through out the storys as well they will both give you missions like the heists as well as other ones that will both help your businesses and other things.

both online and story will be cooperative focused in some way and the only people you will fight are other factions and not other assassins or people in your faction that your running or working with.

when you join a faction both ai and other players will have a special icon on the map players who are friendly will have a green and white icon to tell the player that its another friendly player if its ai it will just be green.

if its a neutral or Allied faction it will be blue and white or just blue if its ai 
and if its a enemy its red and white or just red.

when you join a faction you can become allied with other factions such as law enforcement or player made factions as during missions in freeroam if your in trouble or something weird happens they can come help you but if you do something that goes against that allied faction they will be a enemy and will no longer help you out but if you do something for them they might start helping out again if you do stuff for them.

if a friend makes a faction you can either join them or be immediately allied eith them when ever you play with them when your in a server (friends factions can not turn into a enemy faction the only penalty you get for going against them in some way is you lose money or some sort of item to do with that other faction or yours)

each era will bring the mechanics and setting from each game and will change when ever you cross over into a new area when playing so when ever you go into a new area make sure to change up your style of gameplay and who to look at different ways to progress through each area as some things will be harder then others hopefully ubisoft takes this to heart as co op in unity was fun but was only for some missions and wasnt used to its full potential and that tv spot even thought it was Exaggerated looked like what it might be if assassins creed was fully multiplayer like gta online make sure to give feed back 

by the way the only places with leveling is in online with other players as thats who you will unlock stuff over time as well as you can gain levels in story while playing with friends it just doesnt effect the ai enemies in the game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/hr7gua/assassins_creed_freedom/,2020-07-15 02:54:40

sgicon,pylevgeh,1643575205.0,When will Ubisoft stop throwing away money?,2,2,"The PC launcher, and everything connected to it, is hot garbage - and it always has been.  I don't care what cut of the profits Steam takes, because the 30% take on Steam is a hell of a lot better than the 0% Ubisoft has gotten from me since I quit consoles ten years ago.  Not putting your game out on Steam is not going to drive users from Steam, but it will certainly drive them from buying Ubisoft products.

Games that do release on third-party platforms still get stuck with Denuvo, which is absolute trash, and no amount of blaming the user (or pointing to the small percentage of users who don't have problems with it) will ever change the fact that it destroys system stability.  The service factually drives away users who want to buy Ubisoft products, in exchange for protecting the products from people who will NEVER pay for them... and that's just for the 1 - 6 months it takes to crack the game, after which Denuvo will still be driving away paying customers while doing nothing to stop pirates.

This type of backwards, ignorant greed is exhausting.  I'm tired of seeing companies like Ubisoft maximize short-term gains at the expense of actually being able to develop a following on PC, at the expense of developing long-term relationships with a massive group of customers that they have this-far been unable to tap.  

They seem to not believe they can truly expand their market on PC, but that's a self-fulfilling prophecy so long as they refuse to go to the PC market where the customers are, insisting instead that users come to their obviously inferior, dilapidated, collapsing marketplace.  So long as they keep inflicting unnecessary and invasive security measures on those customers.  So long as they keep making customer-harming decisions to try and min/max profits.  So long as they keep these practices up, they're going to continue missing 100% of the money spent by a large majority of PC users, a base known for spending more money (per capita) on the hobby than anyone else - and they're only going to have themselves to blame.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/sgicon/when_will_ubisoft_stop_throwing_away_money/,2022-01-31 04:40:05
1fqjl48,OutlawGaming01,1727428529.0,A Japanese gamer’s perspective on Assassin’s Creed Shadows,514,1439,"Yasuke being a legit samurai has never really been proven. Yeah, he pops up in anime now 'cause it looks cool, but growing up, we never learned about him like that.

If the game's gonna be about a real historical figure, it would've made way more sense to go with someone famous, like Miyamoto Musashi, instead of trying to make Yasuke fit the role—especially since we barely know anything about him.

Making Yasuke, who probably wasn’t even a samurai for real, the face of samurai culture kinda feels like it's taking away from Japan's actual history.

That’s why people are saying the game’s guilty of cultural appropriation. It’s rubbed some Japanese and international fans the wrong way. Honestly, if Ubisoft wanted to include Yasuke, they could’ve just had him alongside a well-known Japanese samurai instead of making him the main guy.


What do other Japanese gamers think about this? 

EDIT.1:

Someone made a very interesting point below:

“Yasuke is our first historical protagonist” -ac shadows most recent “showcase” at 2:58

https://youtu.be/IFnLUfEgjYs?si=qhIsSQjhcSm059Ki


EDIT.2:  A common reply I keep seeing is: (BRUH, its just a game, chill)

Asian hate is real and having grown up in the U.S. (teenage years), I personally experienced many challenges related to it. Over the years, I’ve become more capable of defending myself.

However, when I see a French company create a non-Japanese protagonist in a game who is depicted as significantly taller and stronger than the Japanese characters, it feels like they’re promoting a problematic narrative. It comes off as culturally insensitive and tone-deaf.

Normally, I don’t pay much attention to discussions around DEI in gaming, but in this case, the decision feels particularly misguided and could have been handled with more care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fqjl48/a_japanese_gamers_perspective_on_assassins_creed/,2024-09-27 17:15:29
mwfo2k,Comprehensive_Part42,1619127854.0,I quit my job of 4 years at Ubisoft Customer Support. It was messy,179,37,"\#HoldUbisoftAccountable

I worked for over 4 years as a customer support representative at Ubisoft in the US. It's a soul-crushing job that really shouldn't have any reason to be. The customers are usually great, the coworkers are awesome, and the product is literally video games.

Naturally, the problem is the corporate work culture. Large for-profit businesses can't let anything be comfortable if cutting that comfort means more profit for folks at the top and for the investors. Growth is king.

So why did I stay for so long? I'm a gamer and I know how I'd want to be treated if I ran into an issue in a game or with my account. I felt like things could be better and I wanted to help make those improvements a reality. Recently, I finally remembered that great Ubisoft villain, Vaas, from Far Cry 3:

"" The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. ""

Quitting was not enough for me. I still wanted to try to leave things better than I found them. So I started writing my resignation letter. This was going to ruffle some feathers...

What follows is a version of that open letter. I do not and will not name any names and I have removed references to internal information.

I'm posting this here because the original was purged from the email servers before most of my colleagues could read it. Some of those that did told me it meant a lot to them and I wanted to try to make this available again.

Yes, this is a letter full of grievances but it's also a letter celebrating what I loved about the job and maybe inspiring the awesome people I left behind to demand better. Maybe you're in a similarly dehumanizing job. Whoever you are, this letter is for you:

>Hello Everyone,  
>  
>It's \[Ubi-Odin\]. Where I can, I will try to keep this constructive.  
>  
>Since we don't announce when anyone leaves anymore, I thought I would go ahead and take the liberty.   
>  
>After more than 4 years of deluding myself that Player First meant something, it's time for me to throw in the towel and follow in the steps of so many talented agents, specialists, and leads, back out from the cult of Ubisoft and into the real world with my head held high. This is effective immediately.  
>  
>This letter is, among other things, a chance to say my peace and close the door behind me so that I may never make the mistake of coming back a third time. This will likely burn any chance I have of working on a high-profile game ever again but if there is even a chance this could improve things for the teams I'm leaving behind and the players I had the pleasure to work with, it's all worth it.  
>  
>I'm going to miss many of you. In my time here I have met a number of my closest friends and most respected colleagues. In particular I want to share just how grateful I am to everyone who was cool when I made my big announcement. Your support literally changed my life.  
>  
>To the players I worked with, I enjoyed speaking with around 97% of you. Even when I had to give someone bad news or let one of you know you were requesting something unreasonable I had an opportunity to have a human connection and a chance to show someone kindness who might just have been having an awful day. I will truly miss the chance to work with you all further.  
>  
>Except the racists, the Nazis, the cheaters, and the phishers. You can all go screw yourselves. I've been waiting to say that for a while.  
>  
>Players, demand better from Ubisoft and remember that the agents are just doing what they can with what little resources they are provided. If you want better support, leave negative reviews any time you are ever feeling underserved so that the powers that be can't pretend everything is rosy.  
>  
>To all the agents and specialists who care about providing a quality service to players, even at personal cost, you're the real heroes. Maybe someday someone will reward you for your efforts instead of holding you hostage to stacked metrics beyond your control.To everyone supporting the agents: I didn't know many of you well but I think the ones I enjoyed working with know who they are. Thanks for being the foundation holding this flimsy department aloft.  
>  
>To Upper Management: I have nothing constructive to say to you that I haven't proposed in some shape or form over the last few years through the proper channels and been told there was no way it could happen.  
>  
>It's going to take a lot more than me quitting for you to start caring about your employees' mental health and on the job stress, or about whether they feel like an actual part of one of the most profitable companies on Earth. We sure aren't paid like it.  
>  
>I remain grateful to management for explicitly letting me know I made the same wages as Target employees, something I had not fully realized until that point. Target associates make more in base wages than we do at the NC CRC and are often offered more schedule stability. For reference, the Target base pay is $15. Support work for the RTP area ranges from about $14 to $30 per hour.  
>  
>Even McDonald's and Walmart have expressed an openness to raising their base pay to $15 in the near future.  
>  
>Ubisoft reported roughly $2,137,000,000 USD in revenue for 2019. How much of those profits did YOU get to share in after profitability bonuses were removed for all permanent employees below the Associate Director level?  
>  
>Before I made this decision, I was in the process of applying, for the second time, for a job at the literal same rate of pay I'm already at, but with significantly expanded responsibilities. That's how much this company has made me question my own worth. No more.  
>  
>A few parting thoughts for the agents I'm leaving behind:- Do not work on the expectation that this job will lead to glowing professional references you can use in the industry outside of Ubisoft (except from other ex-Ubisoft employees). At best they'll confirm you worked for them and what title you had. (Check the employee handbook)- Learn every skill you can there quickly and leave before you get attached, like I wish I had.  
>  
>or- Unionize. It would be catastrophic if there was a work stoppage in Support. What are they going to do? Grab a bunch of folks off the street and train them in less than a week (again)? Call back the folks they just finished furloughing? You have the power if you want it.  
>  
>Be excellent to each other. I wish you all the best in your future gaming endeavors.  
>  
>Sincerely,  
>  
>\[Ubi-Odin\]

I hope my words helps someone whose job makes them feel less than human. We're all born deserving of love and care. It's the systems that need to change.

I’m curious, when exactly did Ubisoft fall off for you? Was it gradual or did they jump the shark at one particular moment?

For me, Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag was their last true high point. The naval combat was fantastic, and it felt like they had so much potential. But look at what they’ve turned out recently. Star Wars Outlaws is embarrassingly mediocre for a franchise with limitless possibilities, and Skull and Bones is just a shadow of what Black Flag achieved years ago. It’s like they completely lost sight of what made their games special.

Maybe it was with Assassin’s Creed Unity and its buggy launch, or was the writing was on the wall with the Watch Dogs series not quite delivering on its promises?

The way I see it, the rot has fully set in at Ubisoft, and honestly, I don’t see them recovering anytime soon. Unless some Elon Musk-type figure steps in, fires the execs and all these managers obsessed with squeezing every last penny out of us with microtransactions, and brings in developers who actually love making games, not just monetising them, it’s hard to see a way out. The culture need to be completely overhauled.

When exactly did their priorities shifted entirely to cranking out cookie-cutter open-world games and pushing live-service models, instead of focusing on creativity and gameplay innovation?

Do they have any chance of turning it around, or are they too far gone at this point? Can Ubisoft can be saved?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fytvun/when_did_ubisoft_fall_off_a_cliff_or_was_it_a/,2024-10-08 15:05:47

On the cover of ""good atmosphere"", and ""new generation"" workplace, lewd jokes and predatory practice were tolerated if not publicly encouraged. 

HR had a ""positive washing"" agenda, any case / complain need to be muffled. Victim put to silence and perpetrator moved in other department or promoted. Request of anonymous whistleblowing mechanism was denied as it would ""expose to a an open revelation""

Ubisoft was its publisher. But it was a part of my childhood although very briefly (that is until my CD broke and I could no longer play it).

I can play it but if there are too much units, then it gets to be too laggy that I could not see what was happening. 

There's a mission for the Sorin (the dragon-looking humanoids with Chinese/Japanese-like culture/aesthetics) where I really have to engage all of my units and make sure that I use each of their skills to fight off the Colonists (humans). But since there's a lot of units involved, it gets too laggy that the next thing that happens is that most of my units or the unit that I have to keep alive gets killed. 

That game has so much potential but it has a rather clunky control and it's very hard to play these days.

1djaa6o,goal_dante_or_vergil,1718770354.0,"Reminder: the Creative Director for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Jonathan Dumont, was directly named as a sexual abuser by female Ubisoft employees in 2020. Instead of being punished, he was instead rewarded by being made Director.  ",3,38,"I have a feeling that this whole debacle about the black Samurai, Yasuke, is just a way for Ubisoft to deflect attention away from the fact that the Creative Director for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Jonathan Dumont, was directly named as an emotional and sexual abuser by female Ubisoft employees in 2020. 

Dumont has been accused of “verbally abusing and making sexual advances toward his colleagues, particularly women and new starters.”

A report from Game Developer into alleged abuse Ubisoft found that Dumont was, according to multiple sources, ""abusive and controlling"" and ""one of the biggest offenders"" at the company. The workers who spoke to Game Developer claim that Dumont would throw objects, punch walls, and be verbally abusive, using slurs that would reduce his targets to tears. He was even said to tell women how they should dress.

""[He] pushes people to the edge of their mental health regularly, and tries to justify his behavior by saying 'this is how you get things done.'"", said a source speaking to the publication. ""[He makes] various misogynistic and homophobic comments, and when he's called out on them will come out with defenses like 'my mother left my father when she realized she was a lesbian, so I know what I am talking about.'""

“Dumont has been responsible for many developers leaving Ubisoft altogether, due to his alleged outbursts “creating a climate of fear.”

""Dumont has been the reason [for] multiple of my colleagues leaving,” the A Better Ubisoft member tells us. “Be it because of sexual advances, belittlement, fear of him, or having seen his behaviour when in a bad mood. His outbursts have created a climate of fear known for years in the studio and failed to be acted on for a long time.”

The source also shares that while Dumont has made an effort to “improve himself”, his alleged past actions “are still very fresh in the mind of many”. As a result, “some in the Quebec studio have asked not to work on Red because of his position on the project.""

This seemingly contradicts Ubisoft's recent claims at a briefing in Paris this Thursday. ""Yes, we stumbled. And we have acknowledged that,"" said Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. ""We learned a lot along the way, and have made meaningful progress with concrete action plans.""

In a statement to TheGamer, Ubisoft provided another response from Guillemot, stating that anyone who was accused of abuse but remains at the company has been ""appropriately disciplined.""

Now that I have sort of reached a conclusion with Bethesda, I want to know more about Ubisoft. 

From what I've observed, Ubisoft has sort of reached a point of stagnation where their recent installments, especially in their Assassin's Creed games, has been nothing but cookie cutter products, following the origins formula. Meanwhile, Far Cry 6 has been nothing but a mediocre success to the point where nobody is talking about it anymore. Their latest watchdogs game, Legion, is crudely designed and a huge downgrade from the second installment of the franchise. The latest things I've heard about their games now is how they're trying so hard to adhere to cultural accuracy while making the game as fantastical as possible, not to mention how this ""tryhardedness"" left a bad taste in the community's mouth.

This got me thinking, what went wrong? From my understanding, people started not liking the franchise after black flag. Meanwhile the old AC games gets a lot of constant praise until today. People also seem to like origins but not the later installments following this formula. Ubisoft also gains their infamy by seemingly not trying to innovate more with their games. I get that they're a business that has to make money and that a tried and true formula is the safest bet compared to the riskier option of experimenting with their games, but perhaps there is something more than that behind the scenes. Is it maybe because of their change of vision? Maybe investors that wants too quick of returns? Or maybe are they leaking money everywhere that they couldn't deviate from the formula too much because it would be detrimental to their finances?

It looks like multiverse concept in pop culture has become a fashion nowadays. With recent films and shows from MCU (e.g. Spider Man: No Way Home) and from other mediums, the whole multiverse idea has come to the spotlight. 

If current Ubisoft makes a new PoP game with this Prince-Verse concept (e.g. Princes from alternate dimensions fighting a common evil etc etc), it will become a hit and a very successful video game project. This idea would work really well because it is them who came up with the reboot concepts like 2008, Redemption and Osiris. I highly think they were genuinely supposed to come up with this idea now if the previous games were successful but unfortunately, PoP always has been unpopular and underrated franchise. There are even many people who don't know that this franchise exist. The later PoP games after the sands saga, PoP 2008 and PoP TFS, didn't sell very well and because of Mechner holding the rights, all the games are sold at a loss and an amount of profit share goes to him. All these made ubisoft shelve the franchise permanently.

I hope that current ubisoft would put AC on pause and would come back to PoP with ideas like this Prince-Verse or other.

In the end, a man can dream...

Super aggressive and violent to everyone? Nope. Their kinda terrifying unpredictable air of mystery? Nope. Any technology that isn’t a washing machine? Nope.

The rabbids have became more kid friendly as time has passed. Ever since rabbids go home they’ve never been the same. The original rabbids were evil and malicious but they’ve lost that edge. They had a civilisation. And now they are dumb rabbits that annoy humans. Rabbids invasion and mario + rabbids are perfect examples.

I wish Ubisoft actually made more call backs to the rabbids past besides the washing machine and the yellow submarines. Like what the hell happened to coliseum and serguei? The rabbids barely do any pop culture references either. Rabbids land kinda brought the old rabbids back by having them use technology and being a party game but it still didn’t have much from the original. Could also be that it was rabbid vs rabbid instead of rabbid vs human or rayman.

I miss the old rabbids, I miss their technology, I miss that technologies style, I miss their iconic scream and eyes Turing red, (seriously it’s “DAAAAAAAAAAH!!!” Not “BAAAAAAAAH!!!” Or whatever the hell the girl in assassin creed odyssey said.) and most importantly I miss serguei. .....in other words I’m saying.....

Sure, they don't give you a lot to do in them sometimes, but the Ubisoft worlds are some of the best ones in gaming to me.

Also, I think that Ubisoft is great at making enemy groups for shooter games, wether it's the Royal Guard in Far Cry 4, Santa Blanca/UNIDAD/Los Extranjeros in Wildlands or Fuerza Nacionales de Defensa in the coming Far Cry 6. :-)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/kggj46/what_would_you_guys_say_are_the_biggest_strengths/,2020-12-20 05:18:31

""Seeing as how Ubisoft shares are in total freefall and they seem open to player feedback, here are my two cents, especially considering recent comments from the VP about needing more time for 'polish' for assassin's creed.

Ubisoft can't see the forest for the trees.

They are fantastic with launching games that are big, open, graphically impressive, and have lots of things to do (mostly meaningless imo but I often get to a point where side quests become boring, repetitive, and time filling nonsense). You don't need more of this.

What you actually need to do more of is things you're less good, or comfortable doing, you need more strategic depth and layers of gameplay that encourages thought and requires players to actually develop some level of skill.

Enemies and environment challenges should actually feel like they respond to the player and adapt accordingly allowing us to implement our newly developed skills or loot in creative and rewarding ways.

Especially for a game that takes places in feudal Japan which has a rich culture of mastery. From little things like brewing tea, forging a sword, and cutting down an emeny.

There is so much narrative potential to tie to a rewarding and creative system.

So please don't waste time or resources on 'polish'. Please don't give more of the same. Please do something different and interesting!""",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fq36fk/letter_to_the_executives_after_shareholder_call/,2024-09-27 02:24:42

1fqm7kq,Maximum_Impressive,1727439061.0,"Historical inaccuracy's as term being co opted into Spreading Racism, Minimal research by gaming companies. Emasculation/Historal bad blood and disrespect.",0,23,"Historical accuracy as term has been co opted by movements who's main objective goal is to dig whistle their racism and hatred of anything Thay seem unsafe . You see it with reactions to minorities in fiction in fantasy settings. Or any any settings essentially. People are also sel selective on when it's applied ,such as new Ghost's of Tsushima game .


The previous game  already had female warriors for example . It's now something being now labeled to have changed .when in reality elements of what's deemed "" changing and revisioning history"" have already existed in that game . It was just deemed acceptable enough or ignored by the player base.

Many times you'll see gamers suggest the games should be historically accurate as very big issue ,when the Truth is most consumers don't really care at the end of day . How many games such a god of war and the like have ever fully perfectly represented the culture they take from However .

Ubisoft has been deemed to have done minimal research on its game of assassins creed . As Japanese users and fact checkers of historical history has pointed out many flaws in its portrayal. Which is true as many thing's are incorrect and speculative inferences. Floor tiles , incorrect usage of family crests and A character being regarded as samurai when historically it's speculation at best.

Ubisoft is in a long list of Western companies misrepresenting cultures .

But its not the only gaming company to do this . Take Capcom and it's pretty infamous history of misrepresenting cultures in its fighting games with some characters not really matching their background . Or games like resident Evil 5 infamously having overt racist elements being portrayed. But both studios fell into this by minimal research.

Gaming companies both east and west both fall into the same trap of not really correctly portraying the cultures they seek to represent. 

Now a element that should be openly addressed as it's been made by users and seems to be worthy of discussion.

The Emasculation of Asian men  across a wider portrayal in media in the west as a trend. Asian men have been disrespected in media by being portrayed as non masculine and subservient to foreigners. It's a trend you'll see spread into how they are regarded . It's a form of orientalism.Movements have risen up to counter this ,due to years of disrespect and Having it  affect personally.

 However like all movements some especially in the west will also end up promoting misogynist views due to those factors seeping into them as movement and also promote bigotry .


 Many users living in the west, and abroad do feel emusculated by a black man Bieng a playable character killing Japanese people as the other playable option is Female . Aswell as making talking points on how assassins creed characters should match there game of origins setting . But as counter point . We're was this energy when afro samurai premiered? Or when many assassins creed games were the mc  Dosent match there games setting? So it's very selective to choose which thing speficcally offends you . Wether it's valid or not .

Another elephant to address is the historical bad bood within asian cultures living in the west with African Americans . The two groups have notably been involved in alot of racist attacks on each other historically. There's very much a real animosity amongst both due to leaving long lasting grievances Especially if violent crimes are involved between African Americans and Asians. This animistosy has been tied to social and economic reasons affecting both communities. 

 So a black character killing Asians was always going to cause some sort of stir .

But again we're was this energy when Japan includes Yasuke as character that does kill Asians such as dynasty warriors. Or reactions towards afro samurai Wich is even more graphic for example.

Another final note to areas is the Nagasaki shrine incitdant . As you know many users feel extremely uncomfortable with the shrine being sold as product. As due to poor research it does match images of destroyed post nuclear strikes. This is undoubtedly a mistake by ubisoft do to failing to research this aspect. 

Japan suffered grievously when it was struck by the bombs . Two cities engulfed instantly in nuclear fire . Historical Japan has always been deeply affected by the bombs . As they were the first people in history to feel the affects of the new weapon of mass destruction. Characters such a Godzilla have arisen to address that fear . And many movements in Japan have risen to promote spreading the message of nuclear weapons and there destruction . 

It also ties into Japan's complex relationshop with the United States . As many feel it's always been something of awkward relationship. The USA does have large presence in how Japan makes its policies and conducts itself . It's very complex issue .

However one thing that should also be addressed is movements in Japan's use of deflection with the nuclear bombs to suppress shame of historical crimes or supress Criticism. Movements have used tie bombs as method to label themselves victims purely innocent on societal level post WW2 . That it was great crime and Japan was simply resting a foreign power . What gets shushed away is Japans Imperial war crimes and expansion of there own colonial history.


Had this Been a thing of past it would be fine . However Japan does walk itself many times into controversies . War shrines in the modern day commerating war criminals. Asking for comfort woman statues to be removed . Or government officials visiting and promoting elements of the unification church with retro nationalism.
 

All these issues have arisen in the wake of new AC as it will serve as historical milestone in how culture of the times will react to a product.In a politically charged time .",https://i.redd.it/uty1fe38fcrd1.png,2024-09-27 20:11:01

Division only has 2 games and honestly we have the most stable online community in the games in my opinion. Then Heartlands got canceled. And now we're waiting on 3. Still. Far Cry and Assassins Creed fall ill to the same things. ""We"" didn't want level systems and ""looter shooters"". And the story got stale and gameplay repetitive.  Far Cry plots starting at 3: Pirates vs Natives and MC, Dictatorship vs rebels, Cult vs rebels, Dictatorship vs rebels. Ghost Recon Breakpoint came in 2019. It's a great game except it feels repetitive but still fun. I don't know, it feels like Assassins Creed isn't even Assassins Creed anymore. Ghost Recon and Div are barely holding on it seems like.

mwfo2k,Comprehensive_Part42,1619127854.0,I quit my job of 4 years at Ubisoft Customer Support. It was messy,182,37,"\#HoldUbisoftAccountable

I worked for over 4 years as a customer support representative at Ubisoft in the US. It's a soul-crushing job that really shouldn't have any reason to be. The customers are usually great, the coworkers are awesome, and the product is literally video games.

Naturally, the problem is the corporate work culture. Large for-profit businesses can't let anything be comfortable if cutting that comfort means more profit for folks at the top and for the investors. Growth is king.

So why did I stay for so long? I'm a gamer and I know how I'd want to be treated if I ran into an issue in a game or with my account. I felt like things could be better and I wanted to help make those improvements a reality. Recently, I finally remembered that great Ubisoft villain, Vaas, from Far Cry 3:

"" The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. ""

Quitting was not enough for me. I still wanted to try to leave things better than I found them. So I started writing my resignation letter. This was going to ruffle some feathers...

What follows is a version of that open letter. I do not and will not name any names and I have removed references to internal information.

I'm posting this here because the original was purged from the email servers before most of my colleagues could read it. Some of those that did told me it meant a lot to them and I wanted to try to make this available again.

Yes, this is a letter full of grievances but it's also a letter celebrating what I loved about the job and maybe inspiring the awesome people I left behind to demand better. Maybe you're in a similarly dehumanizing job. Whoever you are, this letter is for you:

>Hello Everyone,  
>

>Since we don't announce when anyone leaves anymore, I thought I would go ahead and take the liberty.

>After more than 4 years of deluding myself that Player First meant something, it's time for me to throw in the towel and follow in the steps of so many talented agents, specialists, and leads, back out from the cult of Ubisoft and into the real world with my head held high. This is effective immediately.  
>  
>This letter is, among other things, a chance to say my peace and close the door behind me so that I may never make the mistake of coming back a third time. This will likely burn any chance I have of working on a high-profile game ever again but if there is even a chance this could improve things for the teams I'm leaving behind and the players I had the pleasure to work with, it's all worth it.  
>  
>I'm going to miss many of you. In my time here I have met a number of my closest friends and most respected colleagues. In particular I want to share just how grateful I am to everyone who was cool when I made my big announcement. Your support literally changed my life.

>To the players I worked with, I enjoyed speaking with around 97% of you. Even when I had to give someone bad news or let one of you know you were requesting something unreasonable I had an opportunity to have a human connection and a chance to show someone kindness who might just have been having an awful day. I will truly miss the chance to work with you all further.

>  
>I remain grateful to management for explicitly letting me know I made the same wages as Target employees, something I had not fully realized until that point.

>Before I made this decision, I was in the process of applying, for the second time, for a job at the literal same rate of pay I'm already at, but with significantly expanded responsibilities. That's how much this company has made me question my own worth. No more.  
>  
>A few parting thoughts for the agents I'm leaving behind:- Do not work on the expectation that this job will lead to glowing professional references you can use in the industry outside of Ubisoft (except from other ex-Ubisoft employees). At best they'll confirm you worked for them and what title you had. (Check the employee handbook)- Learn every skill you can there quickly and leave before you get attached, like I wish I had.  
>  
>or- Unionize. It would be catastrophic if there was a work stoppage in Support. What are they going to do? Grab a bunch of folks off the street and train them in less than a week (again)? Call back the folks they just finished furloughing? You have the power if you want it.

jtel1n,AngelDrake3,1605262084.0,Watch Dogs Legion Xbox Series X lost saves,179,283,"Was playing WDL on the Xbox Series X and it suddenly froze. Closed it and went back in to find out I've lost hours of progress. Now I dont feel like playing again in case it happens again. Dont know if its a known issue with the new Xbox, but I did read similar problems happening on PC. Hope there's a fix soon. Or at least give us the option to save manually too.

Edit: Requested a refund from Microsoft store after it happened a second time (lost 4 operatives...pain). I have a digital copy.

Edit2: please report here. https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/2292597-Progress-not-saving

Edit3: Ubisoft Support Staff replied in the above thread:
""Hi, everyone!
Thanks again for keeping this thread up to date!
As I said before, please know that we are aware of this issue for players on the Xbox Series X ( regardless of having permadeath mode active or not ) and are working to resolve this as soon as possible! As soon as I get more information to provide you all, I will update this thread! Once again, I truly appreciate you all helping out here!""

Edit4: MS store refused to give refund. One work around that I've been trying is to delete game and reinstall. After every mission or recruit or whatever you dont want to lose (I recommend every 15 minutes), quit to main menu to trigger auto save. It doesn't take that long to resume on Xbox series X. A lot of times it works. Other times, it freezes. Especially if it says ""lost signal to ubisoft server"" or something. If it does that, you lose your progress (it also happens if game crashes or glitches which happens often)

Edit5: u/bin4rydigit says: ""Hey, there is a solution (atleast for the disc version) in WDL to save....it seems that going offline really does enable you to save 100% of the time. I am playing for nearly a week for hours without losing any progress!""
(I dont know whats the effect of going offline on achievements but you can try this if you have the Disk version)

Edit6: from WDL official Twitter: ""We're sorry about the issues you're experiencing. The team is aware of this issue and are working on a fix for it, which we're aiming to have in a patch in early December.""

(Or how to get 700h+ and 500$+ donated Rainbow Six Siege account permanently banned for no reason, without even playing the game)",103,29,"So. I haven't played Rainbow Six Siege since March. A few days ago I decided to play it, lauched the game and... There was a message on the screen that I'm permanently banned for cheating.

I immidiately contacted the support. That was an awful mistake as I thought, beacuse I havn't ever cheated and I havn't even played the game for 6 months. And I got this message in a response (I've translated it from Russian):

*Thank you for contacting Ubisoft Support.*

*You recently contacted us with a question, regarding the blocking of your account.*

*We're sorry, but as a result of careful investigation of your ingame activity by the security department, it was decided to ban your account.*

*Therefore, the ban can not be canceled.*

*Please keep in mind that support has no ability to overturn a ban placed on your account following the denied appeal.*

*Thank you for your time and patience. For any further queries or questions, please feel free to contact us.*

*Unfortunately, we also do not have opportunities to provide you the information about the blocking reasons since the Support has no information about the reasons of blocking players' profiles.*

Ubisoft, what this answer's suppose to mean?

There was ""careful investigation"" but you can't even say what's the reason of ban. It's a very convenient answer, isn't it?

And was there really an investigation? Honestly, I don't think so. This answer seems to me like ""Yeah, you were permanently banned, that sucks, but we don't really care""

And I have a few more things to say.

Firstly, I have never used any cheats in Rainbow Six Siege. And I haven't any reason to use them on my 700h+ and 500$+ donated account. That'd make no sense.

And speaking about ""investigation"" I've made my data information request and there I checked that game wasn't laucnhed since 3rd of March.

Guys, I know that I have nothing to do with this situation, I just want to warn you. Don't ever donate in any Ubisoft game. This can happen to anybody and Ubisoft won't care, they can just ban you for no reason and you can't proof anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/in0qys/thank_you_ubisoft_for_your_great_support_or_how/,2020-09-05 21:03:03

I contacted support and ""Ubi-Dan"" assured me that these logins were actually not suspicious and were not done by a person but instead by an ""advertisement web crawler"" from when I clicked on an advertisement link.

I love classic Ubisoft games, they have a soul unlike the current Ubisoft and its new games, I bought these games as a devoted fan of their POP and AC franchises, but now it turns out that they just spit in my face. at the same time without returning the money to me. it is a pity that instead of strengthening the shaky trust in themselves, they took out the last load-bearing brick and their fortress collapsed!

UPD. I wrote to Ubisoft support and received this response. DLC will be disabled on the PC due to the binding to the online service, DLC will continue to work on consoles and I was also advised to play DLC while they are still available.. looooooooooooooooool

ucdqs2,Ruslanets,1650983068.0,Ubisoft is forcing Ukrainian players to use Russian in-game,48,36,"I understand that many people in Ukraine speak Russian, and I respect that.

But, personally, I am not a fan of using it, and I sure don't like when it's being shoved down my throat. Especially when my city is being targeted by the very Russian missiles from time to time.

So when Ubisoft actually has many different supported languages in their games, including English, but deliberately chooses to restrict them in Ukraine, it seems at the very least strange.

&#x200B;

This restriction is present at least with the FarCry series, Watch\_Dogs series, For Honor, and Riders Republic.

I have contacted their support multiple times but they can't provide any real solution to this.

&#x200B;

Why would they do this? Is there a business angle in doing this that I can't see?

escw8w,SeriousFunGaming,1579704170.0,Wildlands 2 | Far Cry 6 | Division 3 | Assassins Creed Great War,47,11,"*A dream scenario of each one of my favorite Ubisoft franchise games, their direction & unique experience.*

&#x200B;

***Wildlands 2***

Nomad wakes up from a nightmare (*which was Breakpoint*) in a helicopter moving over a civil war torn Iran. After being reprimanded by your military superiors, your Ghost Recon unit much go into a place almost deemed suicidal. Although you have more military aid to your disposal (such as air strikes, armored vehicles & state of the art technology).

Key Themes & Notes

1. Be more like Arma/SOCOM, Less like the Division
2. More gritty, realistic & immersive gameplay experience
3. Hardcore & Harsh Reality Type of Story / Campaign (political, social, etc.)
4. Mission Creator (Mix between Far Cry map editor & Halo Forge)
   1. Singleplayer, Coop or Multiplayer
   2. PvE or PvP
   3. Multiplayer with Game Modes that have objectives (Domination, CTF or King of the Hill)

&#x200B;

***Far Cry 6***

Back to Africa.  Remind people of Far Cry 2 but do it better.

* Multiple Protagonist Options
* Immersive 
   * In-game map in characters hand
   * Limited fast travel
   * No drug trips or jarring breaks from reality
   * Survival mechanics enforced
   * Stealth mechanics enhanced
   * Gameplay experience requiring tuition, planning & execution
* Solid Story with a memorable antagonist (like Vaas in FC3)
* Support the Map Editor Community!!
   * ADVERTISE THIS FEATURE (hardly anyone knows this exists, its mind-blowing)
   * INVEST TIME IN POLISHING THIS FEATURE
   * GIVE MORE PLAYER FREEDOM, OPTIONS & CUSTOMIZATION

&#x200B;

***Division 3***

California. Variety, aesthetic & famous landmarks.  Focus on building a more ""lived in"" world similar to Grand Theft Auto while keeping that post-apocalyptic setting people feel so drawn to. Introduce pet companions (multiple dog breeds) so your single player campaign experience is similar to I AM LEGEND with Dr. Neville & his dog, Sam. 

Key Notes & Ideas

* Ship complete & ***then*** treat it like a live service
* Make the Dark Zone a 3rd person version of Escape from Tarkov
   * Slightly simplified (such as amount of ammo types or locational damage) but just as deep with mechanics (like attachments, gear, objectives & other Division-esque items)
* No artificial skills
   * no magic healing stations, X-ray vision or other ridiculous abilities
   * make your dog companion something to invest in
      * training certain skills, developing a bond or giving him certain tech/protection

Ex.  Growling when enemies are nearby, attacking targets, scouting areas ahead, etc.

&#x200B;

***Assassins Creed Great War***

World War One. The war to end all wars. Fairly rudimentary firearms still but definitely more advanced than anything experienced in a AC game since the American Revolutionary War.  The war literally starts with an assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

Key Notes & Themes:

* Technology has greatly improved (tanks, firearms & other tech) which changes a couple things
   * TTD (time to death) is greatly increased
      * every move is crucial (like a Hitman game)
   * More tools to your disposal
      * although preferring a sword & his hidden wrist blades, it is the 1900's ...
* No Level Gating; just let the story flow & develop without the need to grind optional side missions 

&#x200B;

Please steal these ideas & make them a reality. Don't over monetize people. Don't false advertise.

This move will anger the small player base, and they might retaliate by not buying Just Dance 2020, coming later this year. Just Dance is a dyinh franchise, and it's fans are what keep it alive. Not only that, this will nearly destroy any exposure Just Dance has, as well as reduce exposure for Ubisoft itself. New players will have a harder time discovering Just Dance, getting rid of many potential buyers. If people stop buying the game and there's no new people to but it, there's no more money or budget for a new just dance game. 
We need to spread awareness for this with the hashtag #SupportJDChannels And Ubi if your reading this, please rethink your policy.

Since Ubisoft doesn’t offer you to do it yourself, you HAVE to contact them and ask them to do it for you. How can such a simple task be stretched to over A MONTH. Ubisoft, your support is pathetic. I wouldn’t even call it support since you aren’t helping, at all. I can’t call since you don’t have a hotline in my country, all I can do is submit cases and just wait. For weeks. And months.

jreuol,Bluntspark,1604984842.0,Probably not the best idea to get Ubi+ to play Valhalla or WD Legion right now - Ubisoft deducts money and then suspends Ubi+ account after a few hours with little to no support in fixing it.,37,37,"So here's the thing,  
I bought the Ubi+ subscription 6 hours or so ago to play Assassins Creed Valhalla since it seemed like a good game to me. After purchasing the subscription, I started downloading the game over an hour and a half - but then when I went ahead to start the game once download was completed, I saw that my Ubi+ account has been suspended because it showed ""payment failure"". This surprised me because the amount of 15 Euros was deducted from my bank account.

When I contacted Ubisoft Support via Live chat for this issue, they seemed unhelpful to say the least and conversation basically went as follows -

\--------

Donnie W: Thank you for contacting Ubisoft Live Support. Please give me a moment to review your case. In the meantime, feel free to add any additional information that may pertain to your issue, and I will be with you shortly.  
Donnie W: Hello  
Ancient001: Hi there  
Donnie W: How may I help you?  
Ancient001: So basically i bought Ubi+ subscription to play AC Valhalla. I purchased it, downloaded the game but before i was able to start it shows that my ubi+ acc has been suspended  
Ancient001: cause payment failure  
Ancient001: however i've already attached a receipt where the money was already deducted from my acc  
Donnie W: Before we begin, I must verify ownership of your account you are contacting from first. I have sent you an email with a verification link that asks you to verify your account. Kindly click on the link so that I can proceed further.  
Ancient001: ofcourse  
Ancient001: give me a minute  
Donnie W: I need a moment to go through your account  
Ancient001: i've done it  
Ancient001: like i verified using the link, i mean.  
Donnie W: I would like to inform you that your subscription has been expired on 9th November  
Ancient001: but  
Ancient001: i literally bought the subscription today  
Ancient001: i didn't buy it before  
Ancient001: this is literally the first time i've purchased it  
Donnie W: Alright, I need a moment to go through your account  
Ancient001: are you telling me i bought a one day subscription or something =|  
Donnie W: I need a moment to work on your issue  
Ancient001: cause it hasn't even been one day, i just bought it and put the game on download.  
Ancient001: hi?  
Donnie W: I apologize for the delay I am working on your issue  
Ancient001: ok no problem 😄 i'll wait.  
Donnie W: Alright, I will transfer your case to E-Commerce, once you end our chat I will do it right away  
Donnie W: Stay safe and have a good day  
Ancient001: um  
Ancient001: will that be another chat?  
Ancient001: i dont understand  
Donnie W: Our other support will help you out with your issue  
Ancient001: ok...  
Donnie W: You can end our chat now

\--------

This conversation with Donnie was almost 3 hours ago now and I haven't still been forwarded to the ""Ecommerce support team"" as Donnie had suggested. So I decided to go and check the Ubisoft forums - which basically was filled with the same issue by a lot of people.

Apparently this has been happening for over a week now, since the entire forum around [Player Support is filled with threads around this issue](https://forums.ubisoft.com/forumdisplay.php/2126-Player-Support). [I posted a thread myself on the Ubisoft Forum](https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/2291063-My-Ubi-Subscription-suspended-soon-after-purchase-Money-deducted-from-acc-tho?p=15237162&posted=1#post15237162) asking for help from other people and the only response i got was that this is a known issue but I haven't heard about it in public sphere at all so I thought I'd make a reddit thread about it because at the moment my situation is that I've wasted over 6 hours, I'm 15 Euros poorer, I do not have access to the games I've been promised, I have to click on an agreement which says I can't ask for a refund when I paid the Ubi+ subscription and I've no idea if i'll be given extra days or compensated via subscription days/hours in anyway for the days/hours wasted during all this mess.

I'll update this thread as I come across more information about all this but I thought I'd let people know that it's probably not the best idea to get Ubi+ in order to play the latest games like Valhalla or Watch Dogs Legion. Seems like I'll miss the launch day, I hope I don't miss the entire launch week and Ubisoft fixes this Asap =/",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/jreuol/probably_not_the_best_idea_to_get_ubi_to_play/,2020-11-10 13:07:22
ffb7pd,NuclearDisaster5,1583666049.0,PSN users can't share WoNY on their primary console with other accounts!,41,8,"I am posting this on the forums, on twitter and on The Division 2 reddit thread. And all I got is negative comments besides some dudes that have the same problem are with me. This is just going to far from Ubisoft and I can't stress it enough why this isn't even legal to do to your PSN users. So, let me start.

Before the DLC WoNY was released I had the base game on my second account. Just like I have some games on my main account, this doesnt bother me at all, because I can gameshare between my accounts because that is the policy that PS users have, just like Xbox users. I read under WoNY page on PSN Store that the game is shareable, I read on Ubisoft support page that the game is shareable as a DLC ( you can't share bonus content, or in game coins... and I couldnt care less for those ). I bought the game and the suprise I got is that the dude with the Heli is sending me to the store to go and buy the DLC. Ofcourse I was shocked and went investigating. Below I will post everything I have on this.   


\- When I went to Twitter to post about this problem I clearly got an answer that they can call the DLC how they want, and they are calling it BONUS CONTENT. I wouldn't have a problem with it if Ubisoft didn't advertise the game as DLC EXPANSION.  Links on pictures below. 

 https://imgur.com/f4icVoB 

 https://imgur.com/QeMkE9M 

 https://imgur.com/mMHpvo6   


As you can see from the pictures, they are clearly calling it an EXPANSION. Not an BONUS CONTENT!

&#x200B;

\- Second thing that I found is this on their support page.  https://imgur.com/Hhpc0d0  - Here you can read that PS users can share any downlodable content. As they are reffering to WoNY as DLC EXPANSION, PSN users need to get their share on other accounts. 

\- Third thing. Xbox users got a patch to share their games across accounts. So, it is possible to do the same to PSN users, but for some reason they are not doing it. 

This is clearly false advertisment, and money grabbing. I have the base game from the begining of the Base game. Loved the game, loved the content and loved the grind with my friends. Now I really don't want to start all from the start on the second account and ditch my fully loaded Charachter on my main account. Ubisoft is clearly not in the right spot about this, and this needs to be adressed.

1fsz8e4,czaremanuel,1727712304.0,"Can't submit a refund request, can't submit a support ticket, literally trapped with a purchase. how is Ubisoft a AAA game company?",36,13,"Yesterday I bought AC origins thru the Connect PC app. I decided I want to get the gold version since it's on sale and I want the DLC, and since I'm under 2hrs of playtime and I'm giving them more money I naively figured a refund would be no problem. But the game is not in my online account at ALL, it only shows up on the connect app, where I see no option to submit a refund request. 

So I go to their support page, and I get an infinite loading animation when I click ""contact us"" (multiple devices, gigabit ethernet, not my browser or connection). Am I the only one who gets this infinite loading thing when trying to reach out to them...?

I don't mean for this to devolve into a rant but how can a AAA game studio operate like this? Where is the after-sales service and general QA for the Connect app...? Am I just out of luck for requesting a refund? It's not much money but I'm within the bounds of the refund policy so this is a matter of principle.

So here I am on the day of the game I wanna play coming out. $100 down the whole with no ability to play the game or even calm a support number. Just get tossed around chat bullshit.

dc9l3o,Deathl0ck,1570019746.0,Your anti-cheat is the definition of awful.,37,13,"Just a quick little rant about Ubisoft's anticheat on Rainbow Six: Siege.

So I buy the game, with the season pass which included all the ops. I play roughly 40 hours, manage to get to around level 40, generally enjoying the game. I decide to buy some R6 points to get some skins and a renown booster to help me out. About a day or two later I get instantly permanently banned for 'cheating'.

Now I know for a fact I have NOT cheated on this game, I simply played it, got a pretty decent K/D and without boasting I was a pretty good player, coming top 2 more or less every game. Which is why I am so pissed off about being banned for no reason whatsoever... Now I know theres probably people saying 'well you obviously have cheated so deal with it' and all of you might as well stop typing your hate comments now. 

I contacted support right after I got kicked from my game and told I was perma banned, and of course they were about as useful as pigeon shit on a pavement in Trafalgar square. 

The main reason I'm making this is because nobody at Support will listen to me, so maybe this might help. How do I go about sorting a debate about getting my account back? Like you can call me a liar or whatever but I wouldn't be going this far If I was actually cheating. I spent money on this game, and to have that removed from me for no reason at all is very frustrating and to be honest I feel like Ubisoft has just robbed me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/dc9l3o/your_anticheat_is_the_definition_of_awful/,2019-10-02 20:35:46

I contacted Ubisoft Support and explained what happened, and that I had not claimed the item in game and would like a refund.  They refused saying they don't reverse in game purchases under any circumstance.

I decided to try the overlay again to make sure it wasn't just a fluke.  In the video you can see I'm navigating around.  Then hit O to go back, the overlay closes, I open it again and it shows the item as purchased.

mzzqhr,TheSatanistOfStLouis,1619560627.0,Is Ubisoft Support notoriously bad?,30,6,"So, I started playing Assassin's Creed: Syndicate for the first time - and like I always do, I start off by collecting all the collectables first. I didn't really notice or care about Helix Credits until I realized that the map to collect helix glitches were behind a Helix Credits paywall [I'm a completionist]. By that point, I had collected all of the other collectables and wanted to finish getting the Helix Glitches. I noticed that I had 945 helix credits and wanted to see how I could get 55 more without paying for any.

I looked up how to earn Helix Credits and I learned that I should have more than enough:

* 500 from the Season Pass
* 400 from a Uplay reward that I redeemed
* 200 from completing the introduction
* 50 from collecting 50 Helix Glitches
* 50 from collecting 100 Helix Glitches
* 100 from collecting all of the beer bottles
* 125 from collecting all of the illustrations
* 20 from collecting two Social Glitches [when they worked].


This is a total of 1445 Helix Credits. But I only have 945. I am missing exactly 500 Helix Credits [and I have not spent any].


I opened a ticket with them in October of 2020 about missing helix credits for Assassin's Creed: Syndicate, stating that I never received the 500 Helix Credits for owning the Season Pass. The chat agent stated that they saw that I did not spend any and saw that I was missing credits and would escalate the issue.

A month later, they updated a ticket saying the credits have been applied to my account. I checked - they weren't. I told them this and they asked me to take a bunch of screen shots of my internet properties, Uplay properties, my firewall and selective start up. They wanted proof that I flushed my DNS and wanted to see my ICS properties. 

A few months of this, then they wanted uncropped screenshots of my proof of purchase. Which is fine, but it took them another 2 months to respond. With [this](https://i.imgur.com/3lDfHKn.png). They couldn't even be bothered to enter my issue.

Today, 7 months from the time I opened my ticket, they sent another update saying ""it appears the credits have been added"".

I checked again. They weren't.

I opened a support chat, they said the credits were added back in July of 2020 and that they were done. They closed the chat and the ticket.

---

I know it's just silly Helix Credits that I don't need. I can find a guide online to get all the glitches - but it's not about that anymore. It's about the principle behind it. Even though they're fictional points and pointless, it just feels dirty.

1. logging in doesn't work sometimes at all  
2. sometimes ubisoft says  they are offline and can't accept invites because of it  
3. friend list not loading in ubisoft connect  
4. Brawlhalla servers won't connect at all but it does for steam why is that? why is steam not banning Iran while Ubisoft bans it?  
5. 50% to 70% of your middle east players in siege are Iranians like quite literally and you don't need proof when you see 90 to 150 to 200 ping both sides having 3 to 5 people with this ping.

If you guys think they play for free and not support games you are highly mistaken they bought the collectors pack and can't even play the game anymore which is quite sad unless they use a IP rerouting service which costs 5$ a month just to access your games which to me and them is verry unfair based on their salaries.

So I contacted Ubisoft 4 days ago because when I tried to launch my game library through GFN(GeForce Now) I got a Ubisoft connect DRM authentication error. It took them 56 hours to initially respond, then they bounced through 25 different agents in 9 hours, MADE ME MAKE A NEW EMAIL ACCOUNT, A NEW UBISOFT CONNECT ACOUNT, AUTHENTICATED ONLY ONE OF 6 GAMES I REQUESTED AFTER ASKING FOR THE EXACT SAME PROOF OF PURCHASE PHOTO 9 TIMES(which wasn’t even for the original game I asked for), SEPARATED MY GAME LIBRARY BETWEEN TWO ACCOUNTS, THEN SUPPORT DELETED THE BRAND NEW ACOUNT THEY FORCED ME TO MAKE. 

After all of that they still  failed to resolve issue, and then  they stonewalled me because I suggested at this point I’d probably just end up making a complaint with the FTC(an excellent resource if you have transactional issues with businesses), that I’d possibly speak with someone about getting refunds for my entire catalog through the respective markets, and speak to someone in the Ubisoft legal department, because I’ve spent a considerable amount on my Ubisoft Catalog, and they’ve wasted a lot of my time. Now none of my games work, including newer purchases for the ghost series which were made directly through the Ubisoft connect account I merged with when uplay shut down. 

Oh yeah, did I forget to mention I already dealt with this when Uplay first shut down? Yeah this is round 2 of this service inexplicably messing up. And even more confusingly, all of my games are shown as owned under my main account, including keys, and I played them all only a few months ago the last time I was subscribed to GFN. 

After this 5 day ordeal, I only have thing to say. 
Dear Ubisoft, from the absolute bottom of my heart, you destroyed my love for your games this weekend, and even worse you soured all the nostalgia I used to have. To be honest, even though this is the tech support flair I don’t even want help, I will never play one of your games again. Y’all ruined it, you really did.

Weird part about it is that I have not received an email warning me somone was trying to log in that allerts you to change the password. I also did change the password since then though, twice even, but my account is still suspended and all the agents tell me is that I have to wait. Well how long?? They all contradict themselves as well, literally all 5 of them said different time frame as well as some other details. Here is the conversation i just had with the last one and it tells you all you need to know :

&#x200B;

Ubi-Tiger (6/30/2020, 6:13:09 PM): Thanks for contacting Ubisoft Support. You're now connected with Ubi-Tiger, please allow a few moments for the agent to acquaint themselves with your case. Our team are working hard to provide support to as many players as possible during these difficult times. Abusive language towards our agents will not be tolerated and will result in the chat session being terminated. 

Ubi-Tiger (6/30/2020, 6:14:09 PM): Hi, as I understand, you are unable to access your Ubisoft account, due to multiple failed login attempts. 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:14:49 PM): Correct. I have to say all previous messages were exactly the same as this one so am I talking to human currently?  

Ubi-Tiger (6/30/2020, 6:15:19 PM): When starting a live chat, a support agent is assisting you, so yes. 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:16:16 PM): Right, ok. Well yes, I have that suspension on my account but no evidence that my account was indeed been attempted to log in. 

Ubi-Tiger (6/30/2020, 6:17:35 PM): Thank you for clarifying this for me. 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:18:03 PM): So is it possible to be lifted?

\[6:32 PM\]

Ubi-Tiger (6/30/2020, 6:19:12 PM): I'm afraid not, as it is an automated system, and it cannot be influenced in any way possible. It has to be waited out. You can try to login after 48 hours, to make sure that the right amount of time has passed, and then try to login into your account. Also, you can try to login into your account, from a different network, if possible, for example a mobile network. 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:19:48 PM): No, please, don't do that. I was told this multiple times last week. 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:20:00 PM): They said wait a day, wait two, then wait a week. 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:20:15 PM): Still nothing... there must be some error in your system.. 

Ubi-Tiger (6/30/2020, 6:21:15 PM): I completely understand how you feel in this situation, however as the system is automated, I'm afraid there is nothing that can be done, except to wait it out. There is no other reason to receive the message other than what is written on it, meaning there is not error in the system. 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:21:35 PM): But i waited for weeks... 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:22:03 PM): I have games on that account, so creating new one is not an option. 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:22:37 PM): It let me change the password sucessfully twice now but not to log in... that is absurd you have to admit. 

Ubi-Tiger (6/30/2020, 6:23:08 PM): Changing the account's password does not bypass the system however, and it is a completely different process as it does not require you to enter your account in order to change the password. 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:23:55 PM): But I checked all the boxes you and your collegues told me, I did all that checking identity, verification, everything. 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:24:07 PM): And suspension is still there for weeks...

\[6:32 PM\]

Ubi-Tiger (6/30/2020, 6:25:11 PM): Verifying your account ownership has nothing to do with the suspension however. I apologize for the inconvenience, however the lock cannot be lifted manually in any way possible, the automated system cannot be influenced in any way. 

Ubi-Tiger (6/30/2020, 6:25:34 PM): As suggested you could try from a different home network, or mobile network for example. 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:26:06 PM): That is ridicilous honestly. Your collegue told me that maximum suspension that can be accumulated is a week, I now waited over a week so almost 8 days and it is still there. 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:26:33 PM): I tried mobile site and website and Uplay. 

Ubi-Tiger (6/30/2020, 6:27:05 PM): I am unaware who has told you that, I am confirming to you that the lock cannot be lifted manually, it must be waited out, meaning 24 hours have to pass without any tries to login into the account within those 24 hours. 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:28:37 PM): Well after contacting 5 different agents now I noticed all of you tell different information, very interesting. Ok, I won't bother you anymore and take your and mine time, I will just report this to higher authority. Goodbye. 

Ubi-Tiger (6/30/2020, 6:28:56 PM): Alright, is there anything else I can assist you with? 

Me (6/30/2020, 6:29:17 PM): Obviously not. Have a nice day/ 

Ubi-Tiger (6/30/2020, 6:29:29 PM): Okay, thank you and have a nice day as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/hirgos/my_account_is_suspended_for_weeks_and_agents_dont/,2020-07-01 01:09:00
o9n3f5,Nufrija,1624895641.0,"""A Ubisoft service is currently unavailable. Please try again later""",24,80,"I've tried everything I could find on the internet about this. 4 hours later and the problem is still here.

I uninstalled the launcher in an attempt to fix an annoying chat bug that was getting worse. Every time I started uplay it would say I have 4, than 7 and today it said 11 new messages. It shows me people that I haven't even messaged once but just added to invite to games and after I click on the chat nothing changes, the alert is still there ......

I installed it again, didn't fix the problem ( of course ). Played 1 game of dominion in For Honor with a friend and left. After an hour I started the game up again but got that message. I tried restarting my uplay and now I cant even get into my account through the launcher.

Does anyone know a fix that works. I've tried everything from turning of IPv6 to flushing DNS, I uninstalled uplay and all the games with Revo Uninstaller, I looked for a program in Task Manager that messes with the launcher but couldn't find it, and a lot more but nothing fricking works. I've seen people fix this problem with one of the fixes mentioned above (turning IPv6 off and on....) and others but nothing is working for me.

Update 1:

I've been talking to support for the past 2+ hours trying to fix the problem. I waited in hopes that it would maybe fix after a day or after updating windows, it didn't. They were fast, direct chat line to support and they tried their best but the problem is still here. I sent all the files needed and they said the will send it to their team to see what the issue might be. Hope I get a response soon and don't get ""donowalled"".I will update when I get new information and hopefully a fix and a reason for the bug.

Update 2: FIXED

The bug is fixed. How? I have no clue. I turned on my PC today and started Ubi ready to see it not working again but for some reason it actually worked without any problems. Technically the bug with chat is still there but better that than not working at all.Thanks for everyone suggesting SFC but I did that as soon as the problem occurred. There were some small bugs/corrupted files in my windows that were found but it was nothing major and the problem was fixed without a hitch. But sadly the Ubi launcher continued to not work for a day and half after that.

I don't know what fixed it, maybe one or all of the things I tried and Ubi launcher spaghetti code needed time to realize it was fine now, or maybe it just fixed itself.... I don't know but I'm glad it works. I hope anyone having this problem will have it fixed soon as well. Try doing everything they recommend on their [site](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/error-message-a-ubisoft-service-is-not-available-at-the-moment/000064731) and also all the things people have found on their own like changing DNS to 1 . 1 . 1 . 1 and 1 . 0 . 0 . 1 (it worked for some people from what I've seen) and so on....

Good luck.

Update 3: PROBLEM IS FU\*\*ING BACK AGAIN

Update 4: It seems they added an update like a week or two weeks ago that fixed the problem. I only learned what the problem was when contacting my ISP. The problem is that their dogwater servers/platform doesn't accept IP addresses with starting numbers 100 or higher. Yes, it just doesn't let them through. That is the dumbest fu\*\*ing design I have ever seen. No other platform has that, only ubi. If you have a dynamic IP address and it is higher than 100 you are just denied a connection. There is no reason for this to even exist and yet ubi have done nothing for years and years to fix this issue. I and almost positive the problem will come back again, cause it seems it always does. When it does, good luck to you all and hopefully you won't be the one cucked by the servers.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*LAST UPDATE\*\*\*\*\*\*

I have canceled the static IP after a month and the launcher works fine. Hopefully the problem doesn't return but I'm not hopeful since a lot of people are still getting this problem constantly. I don't think this problem will ever be fixed. This is what I would recommend to everyone having this problem:

1. As soon as you get it  try connecting to your phones hotspot internet.  
\* If it doesn't work you are golden. The problem is either windows or driver update or some other problem on your side. Contacting support will help.  
\* If it connects over the hotspot you are fu\*\*ed. Only thing you can do is wait for it to get fixed or set up a static IP. Using a VPN helps some people but in my case only the launcher worked. When I tried connecting to For Honor the connection would brake and the launcher would go offline and the same message would appear. Contacting support will just waste your time. The problem might last for a long time or fix itself in a day or two. For me it lasted 10 days before I got the static IP.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/o9n3f5/a_ubisoft_service_is_currently_unavailable_please/,2021-06-28 23:54:01

Asking for a refund for one but you're refusing to do so.,22,8,"I submitted a refund request for Assassin's Creed Valhalla on Monday 9th November it was a preorder.  The reason why I requested refund is that I didn't realise that I could have redeemed my Ubisoft points for a 20% discount. So I requested a refund for the preorder.

In hindsight, I was too impatient as  I then immediately purchased the game again via the website with the 20% discount applied.   So far I have paid twice for this game.

I still have not had an update on my refund request since the 9th November. Please can you assist?  The support ticket number is 13142036.

Looking at the Ubisoft Connect Client when I go to ""My Orders"" it says it is not eligible for refund anymore.   When i go to this order that I made directly on Ubisoft website (which by the way I have confirmed has a different order number) it also says it is not eligible for refund?

So now neither of them can be refunded. My support ticket is still open albeit no response from any staff.

At this point i dont care which order number gets refunded. Please can you refund either of them. I just don't want to be charged twice.

UPDATE 22/11/2020:

&#x200B;

So Ubisoft finally got back to me and refunded £49.99. It's worth noting that I left I contacted Ubisoft support on twitter & Facebook after the issue happened. It was only a few days ago where they replied and the issue was shortly resolved.

Use the link below and scroll to the bottom. Use the login device that you are trying to use, xbox or Playstation. As long as you are logged into that devices app on your phone it should try to automatically log you into the linked ubisoft account. If you know you password this is the final step.

3, They asked for a screenshot of the key and for the bill about that ssd. I sent them cut out the email u can see the shop name and all the details and u can see the email on the bill.

This where thing's gone from bad to bullshit... They what a full screen of my screen the croped out key email is not enough for them .. I mean wtf ???????????????

Why the f.... they whant my full screen on the screenshot. When i worte back that i dont really whant to share my whole screen the response was. "" We cannot validate the purche.""

I MEAN WTF ..  the email address where i recived the bill is totaly different then the one i use for gaming .. and use different for social media aswell. So what on earth whoud that proof for them ? That the shop who sent me the email is the same as on the bill i sent them ? This was the reply ""

In orde to help us with the investigation we will need to see fullscreen images of proof of purchase and the proof of activation key. Fullscreen means the screenshot cannot be cropped.

Once we receive the requsted images that are in line with our internal policies, we will investigate this further. ""

WHAT FUCKING INVESTIGATION ............ WHAT ?

I have a valid code what i whant to add to my libary but i cant becuse i was fucking dumb enough to pay for uplay+ . I cannot delete a game from uplay account becuse i donnu why, welcome to 2021 ..

I tried to loggin with my friends uplay account who got only r6 on it no othere games ofc with his account i can redeem all the games..

Can someone explain me how on earth can be a company this big have such a shit customer service support..

Investigate my a... what ? i have the bill i have the email with code i sent you both the code is vaild becuse i tried like 6 times on site to redeem the game and they whant a full screenshoot of my mail box  its not enough for them that i cut it from gmail the whole bill and whole email from the shop ....

So, I check the eShop, and yes there is a new UNO game on there. They even purged the old one from the eShop. Only problem is, I’m not seeing the aforementioned 100% discount. I also tried looking on Nintendo’s website to log in from there, but it’s not even listed on there, just the eShop. Ubisoft Support doesn’t even acknowledge its existence.

I even made my friends buy it but in the end I could't get it.

I got in touch with customer relations of course and asked if they can help me buy it with discount since my account it locked.

They said they can't.

But I wonder is it too hard to send a sale code? Fİnd soultion? Help customers?

I had an issue with a AAA developer, in the end they said chose a gift and I picked AAA game worth 50 Dollars.

A phone company sent a new phone with full accosories.

So I feel like some brands now how to treat customers instead of just saying buy it somewhere else.

&#x200B;

Please Ubisoft, consider. You can really do it better.

&#x200B;

Today Ubisoft just screwed more.

I was playing their mobile game and game had a glitch (I have screenshots of it to prove it too) .

Thanks to glitch my game bought some unnecesary stuff with my hard earned credits.

I reported it and they said we can't take back the bought energies and we will not give back your credits.

I wonder if they are aware that is all software, I didn't get something pyhsical?

Is it really to hard to give back what was taken!? from me and say ""Sorry for the trouble we caused""?

f6y4aq,SouperX7,1582226443.0,Uplay+ is horrible,19,3,"At first glance the whole service seems amazing. Unlimited access to over 100 games on the uplay launcher at only 15$ USD. Sounds great right?

I bought it around 48 hours ago and was spending time playing some Ghost Recon with a friend of mine, we spent all night playing it. The next morning I had off of work so I decided to play solo for a bit. After about an hour or so the game closed itself and I was told that my Uplay+ sub has been suspended because it couldn't process the payment. Which is odd because I had well over enough money to buy the service, it even dinged my bank account for $16.09. Correct me if I am wrong but it shouldn't let me use the service if the payment didn't go through. So now I am down $16.09 and submitted a ticket to customer support asking why my account was suspended as well as why it had taken my money if the payment didn't go through. All i got from support was that I should change my payment method to paypal because ""Ubisoft stores seem to work better with paypal"" and that my payment would be refunded within 5 - 7 business days. Alright that's cool, I am fine with waiting for my money back. I changed my payment method to see if it would let me play it again, changed it to paypal and it didn't work. Then I changed it back to my card and it didn't work again. Oh well, guess I will just wait for my refund. I woke up this morning, got gas in my car and then sat down at my desk to look at emails and I see one from Ubisoft saying that it charged me for another $16.09. So now I have paid double for my Uplay+ sub and its not even working. Contacted support wanting a full refund and they gave it to me. I do not think I will be using uplay+ again after this issue.

cded92,Uuzee,1563175399.0,Never received R6 Siege after purchase,20,4,"UPDATE: Still nothing. 

Okay, so here's the issue.

On Friday night, I purchased the base edition of Rainbow 6: Siege through the Uplay client and used a 20% discount code I received from claiming my points.

After the purchase, I received an email receipt from PayPal and the money had left my account. On inspection, the game wasn't visible in my library to download it. I checked the ""My Orders"" page on Uplay and it shows very clearly that I purchased the game and it should be in my library.

I've had 0 response on Twitter, both in a DM and tweeting @UbisoftSupport (and other handles). I have also created a support ticket, however the only response Ive had was to send through the receipt I received in my email from Ubisoft. The issue is I never even got an email from them in the first place after purchasing it. I have sent all other proof but haven't yet had a response since.

The live chat isn't an option because when you select for the issue related to ""Ubisoft Store"" from the dropdown, the Live Chat button gets removed.

There is literally nowhere else I can go to get proper support. What can I do other than wait for an unknown amount of time before I maybe get a response on my ticket which will likely lead to having to respond again, further making the issue drag on.

It was purchased through PayPal, however I don't want to submit a charge back because I actually want the game I paid for and doing a charge back probably wouldn't fix the issue.

On July 12th 2020 I pre ordered the collectors edition of Far Cry 6 from the ubisoft store. My credit card was charged, and thus I assumed that my pre order was sorted and It would be here on launch day.

On October 6th 2021  (the day before the game released) I Contacted their customer support to inquire about why I hadn’t yet Received tracking info for my purchase. It was at this point I was informed that my order had been canceled due to a system error and that I had been refunded. I subsequently contacted my credit card company and confirmed that I had not in fact been refunded. I reached back out to Ubisoft later that day And after providing proof of the charge still being visible on my end was told that they would send it to their billing team and look into it.

On October 28th 2021 I received the following message : [On imgur](https://imgur.com/a/nc9j0mJ)




I then waited an ample amount of time, and after having never received the refund I reached back out to them on December 21st letting them know that I still had not got my money back. 

On december 22nd I received a response with the same exact wording as the correspondence on October 28th [On imgur](https://imgur.com/a/nc9j0mJ)

1b8bwbd,Proud-Host-3932,1709760721.0,Former member of Ubisoft Support here. Support questions welcome! AMA,18,156,"Hey there folks,

Yes, you read correctly. I used to be a member of Ubisoft Support for almost 2 years.

Since Ubisoft Support has hit a pretty big low over the last year, I thought it'd be useful to create this post.

Many of you may have seen me being pretty active on this subreddit, and some of you have messaged me on my DMs to ask me questions. A lot of the posts I have seen, seem to ask the same exact questions everyday. So I thought it would be good for me to create this post, where I can answer some of them. Due to my time in support, I do have a lot of expertise that I think would be useful to share. I have seen other users who have also stated they used to work for them that have also shared their own knowledge to help you folks out.

Here are a few ground rules:

1. Keep in mind, THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL UBISOFT SUPPORT THREAD. I have no way of recovering your account, changing your email, or directly resolving your issue. I will simply be acting as a sort of advisor, that can save you some time while you wait for a response on your support ticket. I am also NOT REPRESENTING UBISOFT in any sort of fashion.
2. Let's try to keep a good tone with no foul language. I will not be responding to questions that ask ""Why is Ubisoft so shit? hurr durr"". Those types of people will be blocked. Regular questions, especially those related to support issues, will be welcome.
3. I am making this post as a hobby and to help out. I won't be monitoring it 24/7 so if I sometimes provide you with a delayed response, that's because life was calling. It may still be faster than Support's response though.
4. Since Ubisoft Support's guidelines are subject to change, and it's been a while since my time there, some of the things I tell you may not have 100% accuracy. Especially, when it comes to account recovery. But as far as I have seen other posts, around 95% of the rules are still the same.
5. If some questions do repeat, you may see me copying the same answers for duplicates. I don't always have the time to manually write a detailed and personalized answer to everyone, so this keeps it simple for me, while also giving you as much info as possible. It's nothing personal.

On the 3rd note, I have come across other users who also have worked for Ubisoft Support and have the same type of expertise, maybe even more than me. So if they see this and want to join in and answer some questions, they are free to do so.

You could also message me on chat, but I don't really look at my DMs often, so I may respond in an even less timely manner if I'm busy.

Without further a do, feel free to ask anything on your mind. If this post can be pinned for others to see, it would be great.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1b8bwbd/former_member_of_ubisoft_support_here_support/,2024-03-07 05:32:01

my friends and me played some casuals. My mate called ""UkiSchmucki"" is really unexperienced in shooters and a totally noob. He dropped his C4 by an accident and instead of grabbing it, he accidentally detonated it and kill himself. After that he got permanently banned fpr cheating. His KDA was 0:2:0 - the games before weren't better. After that obviously fail by battle-eye he contacted the ubisoft-support. The support named ""Ubi-Taco"" answered several times with copy and paste messages and declined his request for unban even before the case was closed and said: ""Plese remember that Ubisoft Support has no way to undo a ban placed on your account following a rejected appeal."". After that joke of a ""support"" he requested two other supporter, both said they can't unban him if the appeal got denied. Is it fair to ban a player because an anti-cheat software doesn't work fine?

It looks zero suspicous. And is it fair to ban someone permanently just because one support called ""Ubi-Taco"" doesn't care about his case. The support is there to help the community and not to punish them just because some don't feel like working.

&#x200B;

Ubisoft wants to be community firendly and I hope that some supporters will read this and help us. Otherwise there is no need to pump more money into ubisoft ever again if they are just banning people with no act of support or refund the game when you cant undo the outrageous mistake of one supporter.

wcy6pr,Chrilyss9,1659299475.0,Rant: Ubisoft is sitting on a gold mine.,17,4,"I play Ubisoft games religiously (Assassins Creed, Watch Dogs, Rainbow Six Siege, Ghost Recon, For Honor, Far Cry, and so on), and my gaming buddy insists I need to share my idea for Ubisofts next big thing, so out of respect for his peace and my sanity, I would like to share to you what I would dub ***Project Animus***.

Considering all the IP and crossovers that Ubisoft does, and all their unique game mechanics, I argue that they should create a game that pulls from lots of different concepts. Imagine a virtual city where you can recruit and build characters like in Watch Dogs Legion, with special Traits and the ability to train them up even more Traits. They can have a fictional urban open world set in the very near future that has CTOS, with factions in the city such as the authorities, criminals, but also DeadSec, Assassins, Templars/Abstergo, Blume, Echelon, Rainbow Six/Nighthaven/Wolfguard, and so on. This is where your characters act as free agents.

I would make some changes to the open world format. The first is that Free Roam and Missions would be two different modes. Free Roam is your typical fool around and test out things with no conseqeunces, but Missions would be game modes where the players start from one of their safe houses, pick an objective, pick their player, and choose a loadout from their resources. Once they head out, they need to get to the job, complete it, and get back to a safe house before they get hurt or arrested, or permanently lose your character when they die. To do this, players should have six different approaches they can choose and mix from: Sneak, Fight, Run, Drive, Hack, Lead. Each of these carry important mechanics.

* **Sneak**: I think franchises like AC, Watch Dogs, and so on are at their most exciting when they emulate stealth shooters over RPG Hack-And-Slash. Watch Dogs Legion proves that to me, and Im really hoping Assassins Creed someday goes back to that. The concept that you can and will be overwhelmed in time is tense and challenging, and I think it can be enhanced by a mechanic I call Noise. Noise is how much attention you draw when you are out on Runs. Steal or crash cars? Noise. Openly carry weapons or attack NPCs? Noise. Tresspassing or hacking into a secure network? Noise. As you build up more Noise, it becomes harder to travel across the city without being confronted, uniforms only get you by for so long in restricted areas, and eventually the authorities or other factions start to hunt you down, dead or alive. This Noise slowly dies down after the job is complete, which pushes you to use different characters in your roster.
* **Fight**: Like all good stealth missions, something needs to go wrong eventually, and this is where combat comes in. I think lots of games benefit from emergent gameplay where you only have a few options, and then it can build from there. To steal from Legion again, I think Strike, Dodge, and Block are a great start for melee. Melee weapons don't have stats, but Traits that modify those three simple actions. A blade or club could do really quick strikes, but blocking is less effective. Larger weapons might be hard to conceal, but can break through Blocks or be really hard to Dodge. Mix in Traits like a whirlwind swing or shockwave or charge and it can be deep enough to make you strategize, but not all-consuming in all the chaos. Ranged weapons can be simple aim and shoot, but limiting ammo can add tension, and load weapons such as firearms might draw more noise so it might be smarter to choose tasers, paintball guns, or crossbows. I also think there should be  a mechanical difference between Stuns and Kills. Stuns generate less Noise, but they also have the chance of waking up. Kills take them down quicker and permanently but it generates more Noise. Combat should be rock-paper-scissors for quick and crazy encounters, before you have to escape as reinforcements arrive.
* **Run**: I think free-running is so fun in games, but the Low Mobility Trait is also amazing in Legion. I think some characters should be able to climb over obstacles and run, but others might not be able to vault at all, and others can treat the city as their playground. It allows for more diverse characters and options. This also reinforces my idea that characters should have stamina instead of health. Stamina can influence your ability to climb up the side of buildings or block hits, which in my mind makes more sense instead of explaining why characters recover from gunshots in seconds. Assassins Creed towers would have been much more challenging if there was a concern or losing your grip if you weren't smart about your route.
* **Drive**: I think it is really hard to get driving right in open world games. I think if driving is simple and almost sluggish for most cars, coupled with crashes doing actual damage, would be a really good start for the game, and then have Traits and upgrades allowing it to become more exciting and freeing. Make Stunt Driving a skill so that drifting, 180's, or drive-bys are only available for those who speck into it. Pay for armor plates and windows, or add a stronger engine, or crash webbing to reduce the impacts of crashing to you. I think the kind of car you choose should also determine how much Noise you generate.
* **Hack**: I love the idea of hacking in a modern city. Use drones, smart cars, cameras, or security systems to your advantage. Maybe your Low Mobility Grandma can't climb over a railing, but it doesn't matter because she can get the job done from the van. Or her drones are weapons in and of themselves. That being said, a fun shake-up could be that you have to be careful how long you operate security systems because you could be traced and generate a bunch of Noise, bringing criminals or cops bearing down on you. Ohhhhh, as a total sidenote, imagine if you could customize drones, have Boston Dynamic level stuff. But I digress.
* **Lead**: This format really lends itself to co-op, but Ghost Recon Wildlands did a pretty bang up job with NPC Co-op, so you could even risk bringing multiple characters in to help you. Expanding the ping system could really mean a lot when it comes to how your friends or NPCs support you. Additionally, the characters you recruit and build along the way are important, because you may want a diverse crew of thieves, hackers, muscle, and daredevils. Or you might want to have lawyers or doctors! Sure, they may take up space in your roster, but they might reduce the amount of time your character has Noise or injuries. 

What this ends up creating is a co-op stealth-action game that allows you to choose how you want the mission to go, but every choice impacts your gameplay. It could have regular updates with new missions, new Places of Interest, new items (Pieces of Eden, maybe?) or Traits. This also creates a platform for Ubisoft to launch an absolutely stupid amount of expansions that could be their own game (cough cough make the base game free-to-play and the DLC's purchases so you can make your money without shutting out a fanbase Ubisoft cough cough). Here are some expansions that come to mind!

* Adding to PvP to your PvE is always a blast, and could really increase the competitive replayability, just like how Hunt:Showdown goes about it. Some added ideas would be having multiple missions on the same run so you could decide to avoid confrontations, sabotage their mission, or hunt them down on the way to or from the Mission. Noise could make it easier for you to show up on their map!
* The Animus allows you to visit different Ages a la Assassins Creed, each with a smaller open world and more focused gameplay (The Age of Sails could allow the return of Black Flags era fun, and the Bronze or Dark Age could allow you to command troops in a war, with emotes that allow your troops to form shield walls, charge into battle, or release a volley of arrows, and it could also allow mythical storylines from ancient mythology like whats happening for Valhalla, or maybe Indian, Egyptian, Grecian, Celtic, etc.)
* A free-for-all open world could be crazy fun, Far Cry style, where you don't worry about Noise, you just try to see how long you can go in a crazy open-world like the great outdoors or a rundown city, running the risk for huge rewards if you take on big risks.

I'm not gonna lie, I know this is a huge concept and maybe its not what everyone is looking for, but stepping into the growing PvPvE arena with all the mechanics and lore Ubisoft has at their disposal, combined with all the story expansions they could create, strikes me as a very possible undertaking with next-gen consoles. And the format of free-to-play with the option for paid expansions seems like an awesome way for Ubisoft to consolidate lots of their strongest resources into a powerhouse.

One day you go like, oh tis a nice day to play Breakpoint with yer friends and then you find out your ubisoft account has been stolen by a hacker. Possibly gettin into your email connected to the account as you find Ubisoft email and password change requests in the bin of your email. So you furiously start changing your passwords n emails everywhere do all sorts of anti-virus scans n whatnot meanwhile contacting the support and I'm gonna place screenshots here but lets go in bit of detail.

My account has 4 games.  
For Honor  
Breakpoint  
Legion  
Wildlands

You find purchase confirmations on For Honor, Breakpoint & Legion. But Wildlands is somethin way back like 5 years back, you cant seem to find the confirmation email for that game, maybe you got it gifted but the only person that would've gifted it to you is long gone.You can see purchase history and activity on your ubisoft account made for 2 years straight since thats how far Bank account purchase history lets you look at but you do see what you've bought in Breakpoint, dlcs and skins n whatnot. Meaning you can provide anything that was goin on in your account for 2 years, every detail, you can even contact friends on that said account, you have purchase confirmation emails for 3 out of 4 games and what does support tell you?  
""We dont care you have 99.9% of evidence you are the owner of the account, we need to see purchase confirmation of Wildlands""

TL;DR: Microsoft account linking is limited to single Ubisoft account. Ubisoft prevents me from playing Ubisoft Connect -games via Game Pass. They will not unlink a Microsoft account of mine from a dead mailbox that cannot be accessed. I can prove it’s mine, but Ubisoft won’t allow ANY other method than accessing what cannot be accessed.

Edit 24/01: The case took an absolutely ridiculous turn.

Ubisoft told me that now when I have managed to recovered access to the email address by a 3rd party ISP, which they told to be the ONLY way to verify my ownership of the account... they have now changed the story!

They told me that the reason why I am not seeing the emails sent by their account recovery is due to *""the domain of the email address is obscure and you cannot receive any recovery emails to that email address. Sorry, we understand it must be frustrating that you cannot access this Ubisoft account anymore or unlink your Xbox account.*

Worst customer service I have ever encountered. This seems like a digital theft to me.

****

Had a mailbox that's been dead for years. Dead as in, it doesn't exist on the ISP servers anymore. Haven't existed for a looong time.

Without even knowing, someone (or me? edit 22/01: IT WAS ME!) had linked my Microsoft account to said email ages ago.

Today, I attempted to link my Xbox Account to my Ubisoft account I have been using for the past 7 years. gamepass.ubisoft.com returns generic error. After two hours with Microsoft's tech support, they find out that there's indeed account management part of Ubisoftconnect.com where you can also link the account. Had no idea.

So I attempt to do it and get a message that the Microsoft account is already in use and cannot be linked to my Ubisoft account.

So I contact Ubisoft support via chat and explain the situation.

*Sorry, we will cannot unlink your Microsoft account from the mailbox without you verifying that it's yours.*

**Me**: I can verify it's mine, but the mailbox is in a bitvoid, it doesn't exist. It cannot be accessed. However, I have mails and invoices of me paying for the said mailbox.

*Sorry, that is not possible. Only way to verify is to recover the mailbox via email.*

**Me**: You do understand that it's literally impossible to do as there's no way to access the mailbox.

*Sorry. We will not be able to help you. Verifying via other methods is not possible.*

**Me**: So I am paying for Game Pass which would include Ubisoft Connect -games, but you're unwilling to unlink it - even though I've said I can verify that the mailbox is mine. I am not asking you to do anything else but one of these:

+ 1) Unlink the account and let me relink it to an Ubisoft account that has Email I can access
+ 2) allow me linking it to second account as you can see that the account in question hasn't been used for a ~decade
+ 3) send the original mailbox a verification request and if there's no reply in sometime (eg. 24h, 7d, 14d, 30d) -> it would then be unlinked.

*Sorry, nothing can be done.*

The decade old account is something I cannot access, even though I even know the Ubisoft credentials to login with it, BUT as it hasn't been logged in forever - Ubisoft's service is asking for email verification to force a password reset. Or it was hacked and flagged. Same outcome -> I cannot use the original credentials to login.

Absolutely a stellar 10/10 experience.

****

Let's see what happens by approaching them as a completely clueless tool just saying that ""my account has been hacked"" and see where that leads.

****

**EDITS**

Edit 22/01: Found an Ubisoft link directly pointing out if you lost email access. It requires daytime chat with them, so going to see if this path would help. Apparently not open on weekends?

Edit 22/01: I contacted the third party ISP out of curiosity if the 3rd party email address would be accessible. I was lucky and they told me that - yes - it is. As I was a customer for so long time, they accepted to restore my access to it without any cost for the end of the month. Now I have even access to the mailbox, but the recovery methods that Ubisoft have - are not sending any emails to the said email address. :D

****

Edit 23/01: No updates from Ubisoft on this yet. I updated my ticket by telling them that *""oh, there was no hacker after all - it was my account all along. I have restored access to it via a third party ISP by a stroke of luck (no other users registered the email address for them).*

Edit 23/01: Ubisoft personnel, please don't downvote this. Instead solve the issue you've caused!

You know that the fact that you employ someone/work with someone that upholds certain views doesn't mean you share them right?. I guess a company's employess must all have the same political views or get fired (that's real democratic right there) in fear of the ""public opinion outbreak"" if you get even vaguely associated with a conservative (or in this case a liberal that expressed one conservarive opinion).

 You used to not be able to get a job due to your race, or gender. Now you can't due to your political opinion. Be a democrat/left-leaning liberal or don't work, get canceled. I don't even like Helen, but it's fucked up that you can't disagree politically with the ""majority""  without facing censorship. This is dumb. And it's been going on way too long. And it's apparently only an issue with people on the right with shitty opinions. when it's people on the left working in this industry that support the Chinese Communist Party, everything's fine, that's cool. Who cares that they have people in concentration camps over there?.  

I wish we could just enjoy a game without having to worry that we may be enjoying the work of someone that thinks differently from us. How fragile must your psyche be that you feel threatened because there's someone who thinks differently in a game you like. If I see an actor in a movie who is a communist (for example) I don't give a shit. And If I see a catholic ultra conservative, I don't give a shit.

Just like the title says I'm not sure why there hasn't been a solid solution/fix to having this error code come up when you launch R6.. I've been trying to fix this for OVER TWO DAYS NOW and I don't see and end to this never ending battle. When you lookup this error code on the internet all you find is a bunch of THREADS GOING BACK TO 2021 asking how to fix this problem with no fix in sight

Some people seemingly get this fixed within minutes with no explanation while others like me are sitting in purgatory hell again waiting.. I enjoy playing Rainbow 6 but I don't enjoy Ubisoft or their monkey brain Battleye software. I've scoured every thread on the internet looking for a fix for this and STILL no answers are to be found

It also doesn't help that when ""updating security measures"" fails instead of being able to retry it back to back you have to wait a certain number of seconds before it will even let you retry to ""update"" it again.. At first its 10 seconds and then 20, 70, 120, 350, 750, 950 and then it resets.. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO COMPOUND HOW LONG I WAIT IN-BETWEEN RETRYING AN UPDATE!?!?!? It wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to manually click the retry button every time!! But now trying to fix this for basically the third day now Ive waited over 5 hours in the in-game menu letting this timer spin around multiple times just so I can retry this supposed update when this is all just rooted to Error Code 0-0x00000001... This is the kind of stuff that makes me dislike Ubisoft as a company, I enjoy their games but I cant stand their un-userfriendly practices and are unwilling to fix these silly issues that have been an issue for YEARS and have been a result in countless posts.

List of everything I've tried:

1. Allowed Battleye and anything Battleye related through Windows firewall including anything related to R6
2. Launched Steam, Ubisoft and R6 as an Administrator
3. Uninstalled and reinstalled the game 3 times now including Battleye
4. Uninstalled Battleye and Ubisoft and reinstalled them
5. Reset my computer on multiple occasions
6. Updated my graphics drivers/ reversed graphics drivers
7. Connected my F2A on Ubisoft
8. Logged in and out of Ubisoft
9. Verified game files
10. Updated Windows
11. Unplugged my Ethernet and tried connecting to my hotspot
12. Turned off and uninstalled my VPN's

I haven't tried just giving up on Ubisoft and Rainbow 6 but I'm pretty close to it.. Funny enough while reinstalling the game for the fourth time now and writing this post I've been starting at this for about an hour now.. Good stuff guys

1dfwc5a,BabaYaga3694,1718386113.0,How to Recover Your Ubisoft Account When Support Isn't Helping: Filing a BBB Complaint,14,19,"Hey everyone,

I recently had a stressful experience where my Ubisoft account was hacked, and the email was changed to a Russian one. Despite contacting Ubisoft support multiple times and providing proof of my account they have denied to give my account back

Thankfully, the issue has now been resolved, and I wanted to share a specific step that helped me get my account back: filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB).

Here's how filing a BBB complaint helped me recover my Ubisoft account and the steps you can take if you find yourself in a similar situation:

# Steps to File a BBB Complaint

1. **Gather Evidence**:
   * Document all interactions with Ubisoft support, including support ticket numbers, emails, and screenshots of the issue.
   * Collect evidence of your account ownership, such as purchase receipts or linked accounts.
2. **Visit the BBB Website**:
   * Go to the BBB website at [www.bbb.org](https://www.bbb.org).
3. **File a Complaint**:
   * Navigate to the ""File a Complaint"" section.
   * Provide detailed information about your issue, including how your account was hacked, the lack of response from Ubisoft support, and any evidence you've gathered.
4. **Be Clear and Concise**:
   * Clearly explain the problem and what resolution you are seeking. In my case, I requested that Ubisoft revert the email change and restore my access to the account.
5. **Submit the Complaint**:
   * Once you have filled out all the necessary information, submit your complaint.
6. **Follow Up**:
   * After filing the complaint, you will receive updates from the BBB about the status of your complaint. Ubisoft responded to my BBB complaint within a few days, and my issue was resolved shortly after.

# Why This Works

Filing a complaint with the BBB can prompt a faster response from Ubisoft, as companies take BBB complaints seriously. It adds a level of urgency and accountability, encouraging the company to address your issue promptly.

I hope this helps anyone facing similar issues with their Ubisoft account. If you have any questions about the process, feel free to ask!

The game only launches when Ubisoft Connect is offline, which has been made needlessly difficult ever since the redesign.

I've been trying to tell Support for a few days now in an ongoing case, but they just keep suggesting steps they've already suggested before, requesting files and data I've already given them or completely missing what the actual issue is. It's as if they can't even be bothered to read any previous messages.

I understand that the game is already over a decade old (God, I feel old), but it's still being sold, so imo they have a responsibility to keep the game working. But they keep insisting that the problem is with my system and completely ignore the fact that the issue persists on streaming services that are completely unrelated to my system. It's infuriating.

1db1fp1,Breacher4937,1717848304.0,Former member of Ubisoft Support here. Support questions welcome! AMA (Part 3?),13,157,"Hey there folks,

Yes, you read correctly. I used to be a member of Ubisoft Support for almost 2 years.

Since Ubisoft Support has hit a pretty big low over the last year, I thought it'd be useful to create this post.

A lot of the posts I have seen, seem to ask the same exact questions everyday. So I thought it would be good for me to create this post, where I can answer some of them. Due to my time in support, I do have a lot of expertise that I think would be useful to share. I have seen other users who have also stated they used to work for them that have also shared their own knowledge to help you folks out.

Here are a few ground rules:

1. Keep in mind, THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL UBISOFT SUPPORT THREAD. I have no way of recovering your account, changing your email, or directly resolving your issue. I will simply be acting as a sort of advisor, that can save you some time while you wait for a response on your support ticket. I am also NOT REPRESENTING UBISOFT in any sort of fashion.
2. Let's try to keep a good tone with no foul language. I will not be responding to questions that ask ""Why is Ubisoft so shit? hurr durr"". Those types of people will be blocked. Regular questions, especially those related to support issues, will be welcome.
3. I am making this post as a hobby and to help out. I won't be monitoring it 24/7 so if I sometimes provide you with a delayed response, that's because life was calling. It may still be faster than Support's response though.
4. Since Ubisoft Support's guidelines are subject to change, and it's been a while since my time there, some of the things I tell you may not have 100% accuracy. Especially, when it comes to account recovery. But as far as I have seen other posts, around 95% of the rules are still the same.
5. If some questions do repeat, you may see me copying the same answers for duplicates. I don't always have the time to manually write a detailed and personalized answer to everyone, so this keeps it simple for me, while also giving you as much info as possible. It's nothing personal.
6. In order to not get into trouble, there will be some things that I will not be able to talk about. So if you ask and I tell you that I cannot answer, that is the general reason. Even though it's been a while since I was there, it's better to be safe than sorry.

On the 3rd note, I have come across other users who also have worked for Ubisoft Support and have the same type of expertise, maybe even more than me. So if they see this and want to join in and answer some questions, they are free to do so.

You could also message me on chat, but I don't really look at my DMs often, so I may respond in an even less timely manner if I'm busy.

Without further a do, feel free to ask anything on your mind. If this post can be pinned for others to see, it would be great.

  
PLEASE READ: I decided to re-post this thread to bump it up. 2 months ago I posted it using a previous account that I have lost and got quite a few questions. Then I tried to make a part 2 with less success. However after a bit of time has passed, I found that some people actually still asked questions on the original thread so I decided to do it again, just for fun.

1gdla1g,Tylarid,1730063163.0,Why is Ubisoft Customer Support such dog ass?,11,3,"I played For Honor for years on my Xbox and finally decided to play on PC, through Steam. 

The email account on my Ubisoft on the Xbox is listed as ______@yahoo.com.com (yes it has an extra .com, how that ever got through authentication I'll never understand.) To even ATTEMPT and contact Customer Support you need to log in to an active ubisoft account. Can't log in with a .com.com since that's not a real thing. So, I make another account on my actual email. I do my best to explain the issue, but the ""Rep"" who responded had their name change EVERY response, and it boiled down to me asking to having ownership of the game transferred to the new email. 

The answer? NO! You can't transfer ownership to an email that has an active Ubisoft Account. So, you need an account to contact customer support, but you can't have an account if you want to transfer ownership from a NONEXISTENT email that has YEARS of your game on it to your actual email.

Alright, screw it. I guess I'll start from scratch with Steam, right? Also no! Because it requires the log in to the ubisoft account, and attempting to link Steam (which I paid for the game a second time) to a Ubisoft that doesn't own the game itself, pops up an ""Issue Authenticating Ownership"" and wants you to contact Customer support...

1gc28be,SoSneeKee,1729883697.0,Ubisoft Support Experience,11,8,"Hello, everyone.  2 years ago, I signed up for a Referral Program for Rainbow Six Siege. If the program were completed, you would be granted an in-game skin.  I completed the program according to all parameters, but never received any reward. The program showed completed on my user.  However, the progression was stuck for multiple of my participants I recruited. No matter how many games we played, the progress bar would not increase. After filing a support case, which was subsequently escalated to an internal team, it was confirmed that the progress tracking was bugged and thus failed to deliver the reward that I earned.  At the time, ubisoft support said there is nothing they could do, as there was no way for them to generate a skin for my account.  I dropped it because I believed that this made sense at the time. Fast forward 2 years to now.  With the inception of Rainbow6 marketplace, players can obtain skins from past events, challenges, etc, so long as they have enough r6 currency to pay for it.  Thus, I opened a new support case in hopes Ubisoft Support could either provide me with the r6 credits necessary to buy the skin, or buy the skin themselves and help transfer it to my account.  Below is a record of my experience with this issue.

After referencing previous cases and once again providing screenshots that the progression tracking was bugged, an Ubi rep escalated my case again.  The result they found was that the tracking was indeed bugged at the time, which is why I never got the skin.  Thus, I explained that this skin is now available on marketplace and requested the allotted amount of credits so I may purchase it at no expense to myself.  For reference, this skin is now worth $700USD+/88k  r6 credits+ due to its rarity.  This is why I cannot just buy it myself. Ubisoft support once again told me there is nothing they could do, which I find hard to believe.  How is a support team that assists with r6 credit issues unable to issue r6 credits? They then said ""sorry about that!"" and closed my case.  Naturally, I reopened the case and asked to speak with someone who COULD help me.  Well, support continued to stonewall me, citing that the rewards program was over by the time I opened a case.  This is true, but their own website says that rewards may take 24hr+ to appear on the account, so how could I have known there was a bug before that 24hr time period?  I pushed this issue with support and continued to reopen the case, but they have now resorted to copying/pasting canned responses and bullying me with the threat of support strikes due to ""inappropriate behavior on this case."" As far as I can tell, the only inappropriate thing I've done here is ask Ubisoft Support to do their jobs. I have meticulously provided every shred of detail and evidence they requested regarding this issue.  I had to bother real-life friends to reinstall this game to help me with this referral program two years ago, then bother them again for screenshots proving it is bugged.  Ubisoft does not seem to care and refuses to provide me with a fake, in-game currency to resolve this issue.  It is a very simple solution in my eyes, but they claim there is nothing anyone at the company can do.

I have played this game since day 1 early access, with 9 years of purchase history illustrating my support of this game. My intention is not to generate malice towards Ubi Support, it is to give you some insight on what the ubisoft support experience is like: ""Yes we see proof of the issue, yes the issue was our fault, no we will not do anything about it whatsoever. Sorry you are out $700+, just let it slide this time, okay?"" I have included my entire correspondence with support regarding this matter so you may independently decide who is at fault here.  Please do not harass ubi representatives below.  I have censored the individual rep names to prevent this. It is extremely frustrating that they cannot facilitate such a simple request. I just want the damn skin that I earned.

The support team is hopeless. They have gotten my name/account name wrong multiple times and even referred to *The Crew* as being the discussed issue, not Steep. They have escalated the case to the development team 3 times throughout the year and the most recent was escalated for 10 weeks and I was only told to update my OS when they got back to me (which was up to date according to windows).

I found the issue myself through troubleshooting with another Steep user and using his account and PC where he never had a problem once.

At first the game would crash before the exe. file even ran. Then it stopped crashing all together and was essentially frozen immediately after clicking play.

Tried downloading on a difference PC and the same problem occurred. Had another Steep user log in on my PC and the game would not launch through uplay but would launch through the exe.Logged into my account on their PC (where there has never been a launch issue) and game would not launch through uplay app or the exe.

After an **Optional OS update I had to google to find**, the game launched through the exe. file but cannot connect to the uplay servers so I'm stuck in forever offline.

I've asked for a new license to be issued to my account but it's like they didn't even read the message.

17odt5a,ZoleeKing,1699196693.0,Ubisoft's support system for its users is absolute garbage / non-existent,12,14,"I have never experienced anything worse in terms of receiving support for a product, service, or account that I have or own. And it is not just a single user's experience, as I understand there are a lot of people in the similar positions. 

The only way to get any form of help or assistance from Ubisoft is to submit a case to them. I have had a ticket open since the start of October to change my email address as I no longer had access to the email address (the domain owners have switched to a subscription based model and have deactivated old accounts that were not logged into for a period of time).  I used this email 12 years ago when I created my Ubisoft account. No answer whatsoever to date on the ticket. 

Fast forward to yesterday, somebody has logged into my account from Russia, so now my account is compromised. 

I now need to change my password, but in order to do that I need access to the email account associated with my Ubisoft account, but as previously stated I don't have access to it. I also can't change my email address because Ubisoft hasn't gotten back to me for over a month. 

After contacting the domain owners of my old email address, they were able to reinstate my account (with a clean inbox since my old mail was not migrated) and give me access for 3 days, after which I either have to pay the subscription or deactivate my account again. 

Great so now I can change my password right? Wishful thinking, because the email with the link to change my password just does not arrive. Neither does the email to change the email associated with the Ubisoft account, and neither does the link to enable 2FA on the account. No emails are coming through from Ubisoft, at all. It is a small, country specific email domain, and I have read that the system has issues with those. So now I'm left to wait, and pray that Ubisoft answers my ticket that has been open for over a month. 

I try with the admins of the Ubisoft Discord channel, where I have been monitoring the discussions for just two days, only to discover that multiple users are reporting very similar, if not the same, experiences that I am having. A user reported that their account has also been compromised and have been waiting for the password change email for over a week, one user has been waiting for the same for over a month. Multiple users reported that their ticket to change their email addresses (as they don't have access to the email anymore) have been open and unanswered for over 3 months! 

How is it acceptable (or legal maybe?) for a company this size to have no mechanism whatsoever to support users with simple things like changing of passwords and changing of emails, ESPECIALLY in cases where the users' accounts have been compromised. People have hundreds of dollars’ worth of games/stuff on these accounts. This is just unacceptable in my opinion.

ixxad6,FilipeREP,1600811897.0,My review of EndWar,10,1,"EndWar is a game that I absolutely love. It is one of the new wave RTS games where you do not build bases and only control the units you have and have to make the best of it. It is not an strategy game, it is a TACTICS game and it does it very, very well. The combat is rock-paper-scissors with many combinations, plus special attacks that can turn the table on a stronger opponent. Couple that with the three supports (Air Strike, Force Recon and Electronic Warfare) and you can have quite dynamic battles.

The game has three factions, the European Enforcer Corps ([my favorite](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1619221066)), the Spetsnaz Guards Brigade and the Joint Strike Force. The Europeans are faster and with thinner skin, while the Russians are the opposite, being a heavily armored lumbering force. The Americans are balanced. Before the battle your general will present to you the enemy's counterpart that will be facing you. This is useful to know if you will face more gunships (Airborne) or strong IFVs (Mechanized) and so on, but it is also an extension of the Tom Clancy universe, with characters from Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six (most European commanders) being commanders of the different battalions in game (even though my man Genedy Filatov lost his moustache). This is one of my favorite features in the game - if only those commanders you face didn't repeat so often. The game has three difficulties, Normal, Expert and Hardcore, and this affects the player by the rank and skill of the opposing commander.

Battles mainly revolve around taking Uplinks to receive the battle points you need for reinforcements and support, which can only be captured by the infantry. Since IFV transports double as anti-air, those two are the most dinamic and important units in the game. At the end of battles you are evaluated by your Combat Skill and your Mobility, with a score going from 0 to 100. Those two will give you your leadership score (92%, 100%, etc). While Combat Skill is obviously how many units you destroy versus the ones you lose, the Mobility score is not explained anywhere. Neither in-game nor in the manual. I know I have to keep my units mobile doing something but sometimes I get 98 Mobility and I have no idea why; another problem is pathing, that could receive an upgrade (tanks are particularly clumsy).

The leadership score will give you credits that you can use at the barracks. The barracks is where the game really shines, with your Battalion's order of battle laid out for you to upgrade. Each squad has a name and your squads gain veterancy so they become more deadly. When a unit's health becames too low, you have to order it to retreat in order to fight another day. Your unit will first become combat ineffective and ask for extraction, thus keeping the unit and it's veterancy, but the enemy can kill them and that's not something you want. When a battle reaches a critical point, the losing side receives a WMD (that is immediatly available to the other side once fired) that can destroy many units at once and Command Points for reinforcements drop to half (from 4 to 2). This can really turn the tables on a game and turn victory into defeat.

One of the most intresting features of this game is the military immersion, with the troops chatting between themselves, with differences between the SpecOps controlled by the player and the regulars of the Force Recon. This game also has three novels, one with the main story and the other two within the overrall story, that I believe to be enjoyable reads.

Overrall, it is a very fun game that is underrated by outside reasons, and the lack of internet support (the Theather of War was the main life of this game) didn't do EndWar any favours. I only wish Ubisoft would revisit and refit this game for modern specifications and bring the online multiplayer back.

The open world design of this game has a fundamental difference from most Ubisoft games ( been a long time since i played WD1 so can't remember if that one did this as well) and it is that the overall goal of the character is to get more followers to support his crew and not necessarily take control back of a city that is being entirelly controlled by bad guys So by doing this, they avoid their traditional super reptitive ""outpost capture"" gameplay loop and other ""checklist"" type activities.

San Francisco mostly just feels like it exists despite the player and be actually San Francisco at any given day, and not one controlled by an evil army. The world activities just feel more organic and not something that is there just to give me something to do and it all feels so much more enjoyable because of this.

Now, for some reason they went back to the ""take the city back"" style of design for WD:Legion and to me that's going backwards",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1enl2iy/the_key_difference_in_watch_dogs_2_thats_making/,2024-08-09 07:47:02

&#x200B;

definitely they have some issues with online purchasing and transaction

thank you so much live chat support guy who helping me with asking my issue ( didn't appear AC : Valhalla after 60hours )

to Ubisoft store team and getting new order number without refund and then I got my game

after 10min I received Ubisoft support email check

&#x200B;

past 5 times of live chat support was literally useless

but I'm still appreciate to them at least they recommending me to refund and they're trying to help

even tho most of them saying just wait and there is nothing they can't do

&#x200B;

BUT today last live chat supporter guy said

"" I think there is some issue with your order, let me check this issue with Ubisoft store team, so you can get the new order(?) without refund ""

so I said to myself, okay this is my last attempt

If this is not working I'll just go through another pain which is getting refund

&#x200B;

so I asked how long it will takes?

supporter says it will takes less than a day maybe tomorrow

so I said cool, thank you for the help

&#x200B;

and then like after 2 hours I got the email from Ubisoft supporter( same person )

and said they fixed my issue and even tho it's not appears immediately at least wait 24hours

so hmm okay... but then I just check it after 10min

there was AC : Valhalla

&#x200B;

so I notice that It's really lucky that I met this person who actually trying to fix this

and if you guys are having same issue, maybe ask to live supporter about checking your order to Ubisoft store team because they can just fix it after short time

1byubz9,bertbert1111,1712571491.0,Ubisoft Support is the most infurating experience i have ever made.,10,36,"My problem requires a bit of an explanation, not even much, all it takes is a human being that listenes to it to see that this is not a basic problem AI can solve. Yet it is impossible to get through to someone who isnt a Bot at Ubisoft Support. And i have made so many tickets, Ubisoft support doesnt even take the time to answer anymore, they literally just close the ticket without answering my question. I have tried since November 2023 and now i am ready to give up, therby losing over 500€ worth of games and ingamecontent, which i have accumulated on my account since 2014.

I am an idiot and some of it is for sure my own fault. But im still flabbergasted that Ubisoft-Support is incapable of resolving the problem. It should be possible, i know that for a fact.

In 2021 i did an Upsi and when i started Rainbow Six Siege over Steam, i clicked on the prompt that asked me if i want to link this game with my Ubisoft-account. I didnt check if i was logged in with the correct Ubisoft-account at that moment and then it linked my R6S copy to the wrong Ubisoft-account where i collected all my Assassins creed and Far cry games (Back in the days i for some reason thought it made sense to make a clean new ubisoft-account for Rainbow Six). Since i usually played R6S on another Ubisoft-account on which i already purchased all kinds of Operators and skins, i was shocked when i noticed that all my ingame-purchases were gone. I couldńt start this copy of rainbow six on the correct account anymore. So i wrote Ubisoft-support. They helped me by making ANOTHER ubisoft account with a completely new Emailadress which i created soley for this ubisoft account, and then adding all my games and ingame content on this one. Was okay for me, now i had all my games on the same Ubisoft account and i could play rainbow six again. 

Fast forward to Novmeber 2023: something happened, maybe my info got leaked somewhere, but every single emailadress i own was suddenly locked by microsoft because someone tried to enter them all and used the wrong password too many times. I was able to safe my main-Emailadress with the reactivation-form from microsoft and many hours of talking to microsoft-support. But i wasnt able to safe the emailadress i used ONLY for this Ubisoft-account (the reactivation-form wants you to state exact parts of the last 5 received AND sent mails from this account, which is kinda hard when you never wrote any emails from this emailadresse and you only have 2 mails in your inbox, which are 2step-verification-mails, which for some reason dont count for the form). I tried to safe the emailadresse for 3 full months, talking to support daily, them knowing me by name and feeling sorry already. But in the end we had to give up and decided that its time to ask Ubisoft-support if they can help me to change the mailadresse on the account. 

I made 4 different tickets from November 2023 to now (April 2024). Every single time i ended in the same infuriating AI-Loop that just isnt any help at all. They keep advising me to contact my email-providers support to get access to the emailadress again. But the only reason i am writing with Ubisoft support is, because i have talked to my email-providers support extensively. One time a real supporter suddenly pitched in and said „hey, i see you lost your email-access, lets try something else. Can you provide me with purchase confirmations for the numerous games you have bought over steam and linked to your ubisoft-account?“. I weas so happy when i read that, i used the exact instructions to send purchase confirmations and thought finally, my problem gets resolved im not loosing all my games. But the fucking support just ignored the confirmations i sent them and went RIGHT BACK TO „Hi, we can see that you lost your email-access. You should try talking to your email-providers customer support. We  sadly cannot help you with this issue.“ ?!?!

They asked me fpr purchase-confirmations, which i provided, and THEN they decided to still not help me and not give any explanations to why they dont want to help me anymore. Whenever i tell them that i am not satisfied and that i need a problemsolution, they literally just copy paste the text they sent me before and close the ticket. They even started to close the ticket on me WITHOUT answering anymore.

Since i have tried everything with Microsoft and now with ubisoft, this would mean that i have to give up and just let my 15 games and many ingame-purchases with a worth of at least 500€, go. I feel like this is just incredible. Because Ubisoft-Support refuses to listen to me, i will lose everything i bought from them in the past 10 years.

Hi, I've been trying to get in contact with Ubisoft support for the last few weeks. I don't know if i'm just impatient, but they don't seem to be responding at all. 

The problem i'm having is that i enabled the 2-step factor to my account back in 2018, but as a kid, i did not save either the verification code or the recorvery codes anywhere. I've tried to look through my email but cannot find the recovery codes anywhere. I just need to connect the 2-step factor to my phone number but can't login and do it, because i don't have the codes for the 2-step login. It's so i can play ranked in rainbow six siege.

Is there any form of live support chat with Ubisoft or does that not exist?

If you can help me in anyway, thank you :).

After 24hrs they told me to wait another 24hrs to have the order processed, because they apparently can take your money without processing your order, but they can not refund it because the order is not processed.  
And now after 48hrs in total they basically told me to ""wait a couple more days"" and after further escalation told me they would forward my request to the store team, but pointed out, that they may also just tell me to wait till the technical issues are fixed. Also it would take days, till their support team would contact me.  


Their whole support is just one big shit show, most of the guys just tell you ""yes we are aware, just wait"". But one guy even tried to be funky and asked me to reinstall the launcher and start it with administrator privileges, then he could issue a refund. Asked him why all his colleagues before never mentioned that ""well it just works since recently"". Dude when your order is not processed for days, it has nothing to do with your client. Well surprise it did not work and he could not do anything.

I might be lucky to get my money back via paypal, but I have to wait till monday, to escalate the case and then I have to be lucky, because I can still not access the invoice.

I mean, two weeks agos I asked for help because I didnt received some items from past season reward track.

First, Ubi Logan asked how many premium credits I lost buying season levels. Yea I know, nothing related to missing items.

Then a second agent asked for screenshots of my season pass level and to show that I never received the items. Guess they learned it from Amazon, which also asks you to prove that you never received your purchase...

And for the last update, the agent said they will not even analize my ticket without a VIDEO showing and proving that my season level was 90 and that I didnt got the items. Do they forgot nobody invented a time machine yet? Or better, that not everyone is a streamer that record 100% of their gameplay? I had screenshots in my ticket since the beginning showing my season pass level and the craft npc/table with the blueprints locked/missing, but they are just idiots that can't see screenshots or just choose to ignore them.

My accounts 2-step verification was activated and i was asked to provide a key. Recently there was a weird accident that uninstalled my google authenticator from my phone. So all my bound accounts, including the Ubisoft account were unbound from the phone (this is a different questionable issue for google). I no longer have an authenticator that can provide me with a code to enter. I was also informed that at the time of the authenticator activation, i was sent 6 backup codes to my mail, that i could use in the events i lost my authenticator. I found no such email.

So now im locked out of my account. I try contacting support, but it seems support can only be contacted via live chat during their working hours.

Let me make this very clear, *we should never be forced to use a third party to contact a company about a problem we have with them, let alone just to play a game we already fucking own*. 

All in all this just goes to show how little a shit ubisoft gives about it's customers. There's no automatic way you can submit a complaint through the launcher itself to try and get access to game you own which could then be later checked to avoid people exploiting it. No way of contacting them about problems with a game on their own website without signing in, which is evidently not a simple and easy thing to do. And no way of even speaking to anyone about problems with accessing your account for 6 hours a day. I know uplay gets a lot of shit but haven't bought one of their games for years and so haven't had to deal with it, now I see why people hate it so, so much. 

This is a company that grosses around 2 billion dollars a year but they can't implement a basic functioning launcher, a reliable log in system for their own website or 24/7 customer support without involving a third party.

1aqgmtl,lundon44,1707893167.0,Does Ubisoft customer support exist?,9,26,"Posting here because apparently Ubisoft's Discord, Facebook, Twitter etc all just end up routing you back to their same ""help"" page to open a ticket. A ticket which creates a case. A case that never gets reviewed. 

I hadn't used my Ubisoft Windows app in a while. But recently thought about buying the new Prince of Persia game. My app required an update, which inadvertently required me to log back in again. And the disaster begins..

After logging in with my correct password, my 2FA required a code to be sent to me via email that I need to enter. Well, after 2 weeks of trying every single day and trying different web browsers, no email ever comes with a code. Yes, I checked all spam and junk folders. Now my only assumption is that my account may have been compromised during my time of inactivity and my email changed on my account and the code is being sent elsewhere that I have no access to. 

First thing I did was look for a phone # to call Ubisoft. Of course one does not exist. They want you to open this ""case ticket"". So obviously I did. It's been 10 days with zero updates or responses to my case. This seems wild to me considering a company like Steam can resolve a compromised account in less than 24 hours. 

After searching for further assistance options, I see there is a Discord channel for support. Out of desperation, I join and make a comment like ""How does one receive a response to case that's been open for xx days regarding a possible compromised account?"". Apparently this resulted in an instant ban from the channel and now I can't type any message about anything anywhere on their Discord. Nice. Also couldn't help but notice their channel was riddled with other comments from people also complaining their can't access their accounts, they've been waiting weeks now for a response etc etc. I assume they all got banned too. 

Lastly, I see there is an Ubisoft Facebook page. I try hitting their"" contact us"" button which comically loops you back to their homepage to open a ticket. What happens it you try to open another ticket? You get a message that says ""additional tickets will only delay your response further.""

This whole process is enough to drive someone to abandoning their existing Ubisoft library forever. How does a company not actually offer any form of ""customer support""? Has anyone ever succeeded in resolving a problem with Ubisoft with a ticket?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1aqgmtl/does_ubisoft_customer_support_exist/,2024-02-14 14:46:07
mwfo2k,Comprehensive_Part42,1619127854.0,I quit my job of 4 years at Ubisoft Customer Support. It was messy,182,37,"\#HoldUbisoftAccountable

I worked for over 4 years as a customer support representative at Ubisoft in the US. It's a soul-crushing job that really shouldn't have any reason to be. The customers are usually great, the coworkers are awesome, and the product is literally video games.

Naturally, the problem is the corporate work culture. Large for-profit businesses can't let anything be comfortable if cutting that comfort means more profit for folks at the top and for the investors. Growth is king.

So why did I stay for so long? I'm a gamer and I know how I'd want to be treated if I ran into an issue in a game or with my account. I felt like things could be better and I wanted to help make those improvements a reality. Recently, I finally remembered that great Ubisoft villain, Vaas, from Far Cry 3:

"" The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. ""

Quitting was not enough for me. I still wanted to try to leave things better than I found them. So I started writing my resignation letter. This was going to ruffle some feathers...

What follows is a version of that open letter. I do not and will not name any names and I have removed references to internal information.

I'm posting this here because the original was purged from the email servers before most of my colleagues could read it. Some of those that did told me it meant a lot to them and I wanted to try to make this available again.

Yes, this is a letter full of grievances but it's also a letter celebrating what I loved about the job and maybe inspiring the awesome people I left behind to demand better. Maybe you're in a similarly dehumanizing job. Whoever you are, this letter is for you:

>Hello Everyone,  
>  
>It's \[Ubi-Odin\]. Where I can, I will try to keep this constructive.  
>  
>Since we don't announce when anyone leaves anymore, I thought I would go ahead and take the liberty.   
>  
>After more than 4 years of deluding myself that Player First meant something, it's time for me to throw in the towel and follow in the steps of so many talented agents, specialists, and leads, back out from the cult of Ubisoft and into the real world with my head held high. This is effective immediately.  
>  
>This letter is, among other things, a chance to say my peace and close the door behind me so that I may never make the mistake of coming back a third time. This will likely burn any chance I have of working on a high-profile game ever again but if there is even a chance this could improve things for the teams I'm leaving behind and the players I had the pleasure to work with, it's all worth it.  
>  
>I'm going to miss many of you. In my time here I have met a number of my closest friends and most respected colleagues. In particular I want to share just how grateful I am to everyone who was cool when I made my big announcement. Your support literally changed my life.  
>  
>To the players I worked with, I enjoyed speaking with around 97% of you. Even when I had to give someone bad news or let one of you know you were requesting something unreasonable I had an opportunity to have a human connection and a chance to show someone kindness who might just have been having an awful day. I will truly miss the chance to work with you all further.  
>  
>Except the racists, the Nazis, the cheaters, and the phishers. You can all go screw yourselves. I've been waiting to say that for a while.  
>  
>Players, demand better from Ubisoft and remember that the agents are just doing what they can with what little resources they are provided. If you want better support, leave negative reviews any time you are ever feeling underserved so that the powers that be can't pretend everything is rosy.  
>  
>To all the agents and specialists who care about providing a quality service to players, even at personal cost, you're the real heroes. Maybe someday someone will reward you for your efforts instead of holding you hostage to stacked metrics beyond your control.To everyone supporting the agents: I didn't know many of you well but I think the ones I enjoyed working with know who they are. Thanks for being the foundation holding this flimsy department aloft.  
>  
>To Upper Management: I have nothing constructive to say to you that I haven't proposed in some shape or form over the last few years through the proper channels and been told there was no way it could happen.  
>  
>It's going to take a lot more than me quitting for you to start caring about your employees' mental health and on the job stress, or about whether they feel like an actual part of one of the most profitable companies on Earth. We sure aren't paid like it.  
>  
>I remain grateful to management for explicitly letting me know I made the same wages as Target employees, something I had not fully realized until that point. Target associates make more in base wages than we do at the NC CRC and are often offered more schedule stability. For reference, the Target base pay is $15. Support work for the RTP area ranges from about $14 to $30 per hour.  
>  
>Even McDonald's and Walmart have expressed an openness to raising their base pay to $15 in the near future.  
>  
>Ubisoft reported roughly $2,137,000,000 USD in revenue for 2019. How much of those profits did YOU get to share in after profitability bonuses were removed for all permanent employees below the Associate Director level?  
>  
>Before I made this decision, I was in the process of applying, for the second time, for a job at the literal same rate of pay I'm already at, but with significantly expanded responsibilities. That's how much this company has made me question my own worth. No more.  
>  
>A few parting thoughts for the agents I'm leaving behind:- Do not work on the expectation that this job will lead to glowing professional references you can use in the industry outside of Ubisoft (except from other ex-Ubisoft employees). At best they'll confirm you worked for them and what title you had. (Check the employee handbook)- Learn every skill you can there quickly and leave before you get attached, like I wish I had.  
>  
>or- Unionize. It would be catastrophic if there was a work stoppage in Support. What are they going to do? Grab a bunch of folks off the street and train them in less than a week (again)? Call back the folks they just finished furloughing? You have the power if you want it.  
>  
>Be excellent to each other. I wish you all the best in your future gaming endeavors.  
>  
>Sincerely,  
>  
>\[Ubi-Odin\]

I hope my words helps someone whose job makes them feel less than human. We're all born deserving of love and care. It's the systems that need to change.

escw8w,SeriousFunGaming,1579704170.0,Wildlands 2 | Far Cry 6 | Division 3 | Assassins Creed Great War,46,11,"*A dream scenario of each one of my favorite Ubisoft franchise games, their direction & unique experience.*

&#x200B;

***Wildlands 2***

Nomad wakes up from a nightmare (*which was Breakpoint*) in a helicopter moving over a civil war torn Iran. After being reprimanded by your military superiors, your Ghost Recon unit much go into a place almost deemed suicidal. Although you have more military aid to your disposal (such as air strikes, armored vehicles & state of the art technology).

Key Themes & Notes

1. Be more like Arma/SOCOM, Less like the Division
2. More gritty, realistic & immersive gameplay experience
3. Hardcore & Harsh Reality Type of Story / Campaign (political, social, etc.)
4. Mission Creator (Mix between Far Cry map editor & Halo Forge)
   1. Singleplayer, Coop or Multiplayer
   2. PvE or PvP
   3. Multiplayer with Game Modes that have objectives (Domination, CTF or King of the Hill)

&#x200B;

***Far Cry 6***

Back to Africa.  Remind people of Far Cry 2 but do it better.

* Multiple Protagonist Options
* Immersive 
   * In-game map in characters hand
   * Limited fast travel
   * No drug trips or jarring breaks from reality
   * Survival mechanics enforced
   * Stealth mechanics enhanced
   * Gameplay experience requiring tuition, planning & execution
* Solid Story with a memorable antagonist (like Vaas in FC3)
* Support the Map Editor Community!!
   * ADVERTISE THIS FEATURE (hardly anyone knows this exists, its mind-blowing)
   * INVEST TIME IN POLISHING THIS FEATURE
   * GIVE MORE PLAYER FREEDOM, OPTIONS & CUSTOMIZATION

&#x200B;

***Division 3***

California. Variety, aesthetic & famous landmarks.  Focus on building a more ""lived in"" world similar to Grand Theft Auto while keeping that post-apocalyptic setting people feel so drawn to. Introduce pet companions (multiple dog breeds) so your single player campaign experience is similar to I AM LEGEND with Dr. Neville & his dog, Sam. 

Key Notes & Ideas

* Ship complete & ***then*** treat it like a live service
* Make the Dark Zone a 3rd person version of Escape from Tarkov
   * Slightly simplified (such as amount of ammo types or locational damage) but just as deep with mechanics (like attachments, gear, objectives & other Division-esque items)
* No artificial skills
   * no magic healing stations, X-ray vision or other ridiculous abilities
   * make your dog companion something to invest in
      * training certain skills, developing a bond or giving him certain tech/protection

Ex.  Growling when enemies are nearby, attacking targets, scouting areas ahead, etc.

&#x200B;

***Assassins Creed Great War***

World War One. The war to end all wars. Fairly rudimentary firearms still but definitely more advanced than anything experienced in a AC game since the American Revolutionary War.  The war literally starts with an assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

Key Notes & Themes:

* Technology has greatly improved (tanks, firearms & other tech) which changes a couple things
   * TTD (time to death) is greatly increased
      * every move is crucial (like a Hitman game)
   * More tools to your disposal
      * although preferring a sword & his hidden wrist blades, it is the 1900's ...
* No Level Gating; just let the story flow & develop without the need to grind optional side missions 

&#x200B;

Please steal these ideas & make them a reality. Don't over monetize people. Don't false advertise.

vxq93o,Aelther,1657673091.0,This PR disaster could have been a big PR Win…,44,12,"Dear Ubisoft executives, who are behind this ""magnificent"" decision: [https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/help/gameplay/article/decommissioning-of-online-services-september-2022/000102396](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/help/gameplay/article/decommissioning-of-online-services-september-2022/000102396)

You had a perfect opportunity to free up backend resources, generate some good PR and receive some additional income. You could have assigned a team to unbundle uPlay (Ubisoft Connect) from your older games, bake in all DLCs and uPlay unlockables, and put these ""Complete Editions"" of said games up for sale on Steam, Epic and especially GOG. You would have been cheered, especially by GOG users, who've been waiting for said games for a decade.

Instead you chose to shamelessly steal from us. We understand that centralised multiplayer games have a limited lifespan. We do, but taking away access to single player DLCs is simply disgusting and incredibly anti-consumer. You should be ashamed! We paid for a product, not a service. There is no reason whatsoever for DLCs to require online authorisation. When will you stop punishing your paying customers!? DRM does not work, has never worked and will never work in the future! ""Those who shall not be named"" are not affected. They laugh at you, while your paying customers weep. Why are you making your paying customers resort to c\*\*\*\*s just so they could access the content which they have already paid for?

The answer is clear. You do not care about your customers. You do not care about your on legendary games. You do not care about art. You do not care about game preservation. You have no shame!

Just to be clear, my frustration is directed only at the shameless executives responsible for this disaster. I have nothing but respect for the ground floor developers, who's hard work is being discarded like common trash by the ruling class within Ubisoft.

Nicolas Pouard once infamously said the following about NFTs:  
*“But what we \[at Ubisoft\] are seeing first is the end game. The end game is about giving players the opportunity to resell their items once they’re finished with them or they’re finished playing the game itself. So, it’s really, for them. It’s really beneficial. But they don’t get it for now.”*

Let's ignore the basic fact that trading in-game loot has existed long before NFTs and that it can continue to do so long after this dumb fad passes, and instead focus on game longevity. How do you, Mr Pouard, expect people to trade their NFTs if your games have limited time frame? What value could an in-game item have when the word it inhabits is inherently limited? The answer is none. It can have no value.

Do you wish to know what does give a game value? The sense of ownership. How would you feel if a home appliance store, that sold you your refrigerator, suddenly broke into your home and took the shelving from your refrigerator, just because its warranty had expired? You'd probably be very confused and angry. This is what you, Ubisoft executives, are doing to your customers right now.

So what lesson can we learn from all of this? That Ubisoft DLCs have an expiration date. Maybe base games have one too, we'll have to wait and see, but for now the message is clear: Do not bother buying any DLCs from Ubisoft. Thank you for the lesson I guess?

There's still time to salvage this mess though. As I've mention before, assemble a game preservation team. Have them remove the annoying uPlay integration. Have them bake DLCs and uPlay unlocks into the base game, then put them up for sale on Steam, Epic and especially GOG. Give existing owners a free copy of these ""Complete Editions"" and you will turn this mess around.

If you do not do the above, then you should resign! Resign in shame, because you are unworthy and unfit to hold your roles! Let someone who actually cares about Ubisoft games and its customers take your places. You clearly could not care less about either.

**TL;DR:** Remove uPlay integration, bake DLCs and uPlay unlocks into the base games, then put them up for sale on Steam, Epic and GOG. Alternatively, resign in shame.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/vxq93o/this_pr_disaster_could_have_been_a_big_pr_win/,2022-07-13 08:44:51

I've contacted Ubi support with a PayPal receipt as a proof.

They kindly apologized and told me I've got to wait 24-48h for the tech team to solve it. As you might have guessed, they didn't.

I was really looking forward to having a weekend full of fresh games but poor service delivery messed up with my plans.

This issue is currently under 'known issues' page at Ubi forum.

f6y4aq,SouperX7,1582226443.0,Uplay+ is horrible,19,3,"At first glance the whole service seems amazing. Unlimited access to over 100 games on the uplay launcher at only 15$ USD. Sounds great right?

I bought it around 48 hours ago and was spending time playing some Ghost Recon with a friend of mine, we spent all night playing it. The next morning I had off of work so I decided to play solo for a bit. After about an hour or so the game closed itself and I was told that my Uplay+ sub has been suspended because it couldn't process the payment. Which is odd because I had well over enough money to buy the service, it even dinged my bank account for $16.09. Correct me if I am wrong but it shouldn't let me use the service if the payment didn't go through. So now I am down $16.09 and submitted a ticket to customer support asking why my account was suspended as well as why it had taken my money if the payment didn't go through. All i got from support was that I should change my payment method to paypal because ""Ubisoft stores seem to work better with paypal"" and that my payment would be refunded within 5 - 7 business days. Alright that's cool, I am fine with waiting for my money back. I changed my payment method to see if it would let me play it again, changed it to paypal and it didn't work. Then I changed it back to my card and it didn't work again. Oh well, guess I will just wait for my refund. I woke up this morning, got gas in my car and then sat down at my desk to look at emails and I see one from Ubisoft saying that it charged me for another $16.09. So now I have paid double for my Uplay+ sub and its not even working. Contacted support wanting a full refund and they gave it to me. I do not think I will be using uplay+ again after this issue.

I bought a samsung ssd 2 month ago from a webstore where was a promotion that if i buy selected products i can choose from 3 games. I got 15 days later the cod .. and when tried to use it saw i cannot.

Thats when i started talking with the support.

1, So support had no idea why is that.

2, I managed figure it out that i cannot choose this game ( ac valhalla ) from the selection becuse i have installed it at some point while i had uplay+ ( thats why fenyx grey aswell )

3, They asked for a screenshot of the key and for the bill about that ssd. I sent them cut out the email u can see the shop name and all the details and u can see the email on the bill.

This where thing's gone from bad to bullshit... They what a full screen of my screen the croped out key email is not enough for them .. I mean wtf ???????????????

Why the f.... they whant my full screen on the screenshot. When i worte back that i dont really whant to share my whole screen the response was. "" We cannot validate the purche.""

In orde to help us with the investigation we will need to see fullscreen images of proof of purchase and the proof of activation key. Fullscreen means the screenshot cannot be cropped.

Once we receive the requsted images that are in line with our internal policies, we will investigate this further. ""

WHAT FUCKING INVESTIGATION ............ WHAT ?

I bought Motorfest back in Novemeber through Epic Store and went to install it for which I needed sign in to Ubisoft. I go ahead and sign in to be told there's an error. Fast forward to just before Christmas with a lot of back and forth, investigating and waiting it turns out my Ubisoft account was once connected to another Epic account (my old one from several years ago I no longer have access to and don't use) which I found odd because I don't ever recall buying a Ubisoft game before through Epic and they tell me I need to re-connect the Ubisoft account to that old Epic account.

Anyway last week after a break for Christmas and New Year I re-open my case and explain the situation about old the Epic account etc and they respond (unusually) within a couple hours however they have misunderstood my respone and think I have 2 Ubisoft accounts so send me a code to to move the support ticket to another Ubisoft account.

dao45w,RobDaBomb,1569716638.0,"Stadia is $10 a month and streams upcoming Ubisoft games, XBGP is $10 a month, Origin Premier is $100 for a year -- Uplay+ is $15 a month?",16,13,"**IGNORE THE STADIA MENTION IN THE TITLE**. Stadia is confusing to follow as of now, but it seems you only get one game with Stadia Pro's subscription - while Stadia's Base plan is free monthly and you only purchase the games for your account. **I was very, very fucking wrong initially on it**. Which is fine, now that means just one less subscription to worry about paying for.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If you buy 3 full price Ubisoft games a year then you're paying the same as 12 months of Uplay+, but I believe EA releases 3 major games each year (doesn't mean they're good) and for $100 I get access to them on launch day with all the ultimate edition perks as well... plus any other third-party games Origin adds to their platform. Uplay+ doesn't offer subscription or pricing options, so instead if I constantly want access to all my Ubisoft games as intended I must spend $180 for the same coverage.

Uplay+ seems to be the only subscription service that *exclusively offers their own games*, nothing from competitors like you can see on Origin and XBGP. I think my main concern is just seeing subscription services become a new standard, something I personally want but only if it can be affordable and competitive. Uplay+ is setting a bar for future gaming subscription services that providing customers with only a $15/month price is normal for access to just their own library of content as well as 3-4 new releases a year.

&#x200B;

Note - I am aware that with Uplay+ you have all the dlc/gold edition and maybe even pre-order content (the same as Origin Premier, which can cost less than $8.50 a month if you buy a year of it - so it really feels like you're getting a deal). Obviously your average gamer can still save money without the pass by acquiring DLC/season passes on sales after release. My friends call me a Ubi-cuck considering I preorder games like Far Cry New Dawn the moment it became available last winter, and I plan on playing all their future games as well. So you can see why I'd like to just get Uplay+ if only it didn't feel like so much like a bad lease vs buying a car - there's no other options besides a flat monthly rate on their limited leasing plan. 

These are things some people need to consider especially for someone who's already paying bills for other subscription services too (whether they be gaming specific or even just Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, WarnerMedia's HBO Max/HBO Now, NBC's Peacock, Amazon Prime, DC Universe Now, etc...). 

Again I was incorrect on Stadia and am sorry, they offer a Stadia Pro for $10 a month and then Stadia basic where you purchase the games you want to use through it. Stadia Base does NOT have a monthly fee but it also isn't a game subscription service.  I apologize greatly for this, but partially blame the lack of easily accessible Stadia information for my mistake. Regardless, Uplay+ is still more expensive than Xbox Game Pass, Origin Premier (as you can purchase a year plan and save $80), Humble Monthly, and Discord Nitro.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/dao45w/stadia_is_10_a_month_and_streams_upcoming_ubisoft/,2019-09-29 08:23:58

Thanks for getting back to us,

After a dedicated investigation by our team, I can confirm the following:

We have now unlinked the Xbox profile from your alternate account. You will now be able to access and re-link this profile to your current Ubisoft account.

In terms of recovering the other account, due to security reasons I am afraid this will not be possible however I hope the above at least aids towards your initial problem on contact.

If you require further help, please feel free to reach out to us!

You are giving me no chance here and that's unacceptable:

- You are unable (due to your systems) able to send recovery mails to ""obscure domains with multiple dots, @XXX.XXXX.XXX being the domain) -> YOUR issue

- ...not to mention that often the case is that no access exist to said email address, which is currently my case as well. Yet, I had it - and then you told me that your systems are unable to send the recovery mails to the email address. --> YOUR issue

- At the same time I know all the information linked to the account, there is nothing else that could be added to that list -> still not enough -> YOUR issue

- I still know the credentials to the XXXX and I am able to ""login"" at any moment which triggers the recovery process (except the recovery mails do not arrive as your systems are unable handle the domain) --> YOUR issue

- I asked early this year that I would be contacting you to some other address from XXXXXX to prove I have access to it. You said it's not possible --> YOUR issue

- I have repeatedly asked that you would contact me to the Microsoft account (XXXXX) -> you have declined --> YOUR issue

- I have given you all the proof on the screenshots of my Microsoft account (which include the name of this Ubisoft account I am contacting you with, XXXXXX) --> you haven't used these for anything, yet you wanted me to jump the hoops --> YOUR issue

- You can contact my phone number on the Microsoft account. You would get the confirmation of all this on phone. --> YOU haven't done so -> YOUR issue

= it's all your decisions and policies keeping the account hostage. I think this is ILLEGAL.
= there is nothing I can do, literally nothing - it's all your end
= I am paying them for Game Pass service and you have cut part of that out, making the paid Microsoft service worse

TL;DR: Microsoft account linking is limited to single Ubisoft account. Ubisoft prevents me from playing Ubisoft Connect -games via Game Pass. They will not unlink a Microsoft account of mine from a dead mailbox that cannot be accessed. I can prove it’s mine, but Ubisoft won’t allow ANY other method than accessing what cannot be accessed.

Edit 24/01: The case took an absolutely ridiculous turn.

Ubisoft told me that now when I have managed to recovered access to the email address by a 3rd party ISP, which they told to be the ONLY way to verify my ownership of the account... they have now changed the story!

They told me that the reason why I am not seeing the emails sent by their account recovery is due to *""the domain of the email address is obscure and you cannot receive any recovery emails to that email address. Sorry, we understand it must be frustrating that you cannot access this Ubisoft account anymore or unlink your Xbox account.*

Worst customer service I have ever encountered. This seems like a digital theft to me.

****

Had a mailbox that's been dead for years. Dead as in, it doesn't exist on the ISP servers anymore. Haven't existed for a looong time.

Without even knowing, someone (or me? edit 22/01: IT WAS ME!) had linked my Microsoft account to said email ages ago.

Today, I attempted to link my Xbox Account to my Ubisoft account I have been using for the past 7 years. gamepass.ubisoft.com returns generic error. After two hours with Microsoft's tech support, they find out that there's indeed account management part of Ubisoftconnect.com where you can also link the account. Had no idea.

So I attempt to do it and get a message that the Microsoft account is already in use and cannot be linked to my Ubisoft account.

So I contact Ubisoft support via chat and explain the situation.

*Sorry, we will cannot unlink your Microsoft account from the mailbox without you verifying that it's yours.*

**Me**: I can verify it's mine, but the mailbox is in a bitvoid, it doesn't exist. It cannot be accessed. However, I have mails and invoices of me paying for the said mailbox.

*Sorry, that is not possible. Only way to verify is to recover the mailbox via email.*

**Me**: You do understand that it's literally impossible to do as there's no way to access the mailbox.

*Sorry. We will not be able to help you. Verifying via other methods is not possible.*

**Me**: So I am paying for Game Pass which would include Ubisoft Connect -games, but you're unwilling to unlink it - even though I've said I can verify that the mailbox is mine. I am not asking you to do anything else but one of these:

+ 1) Unlink the account and let me relink it to an Ubisoft account that has Email I can access
+ 2) allow me linking it to second account as you can see that the account in question hasn't been used for a ~decade
+ 3) send the original mailbox a verification request and if there's no reply in sometime (eg. 24h, 7d, 14d, 30d) -> it would then be unlinked.

*Sorry, nothing can be done.*

The decade old account is something I cannot access, even though I even know the Ubisoft credentials to login with it, BUT as it hasn't been logged in forever - Ubisoft's service is asking for email verification to force a password reset. Or it was hacked and flagged. Same outcome -> I cannot use the original credentials to login.

Absolutely a stellar 10/10 experience.

****

Let's see what happens by approaching them as a completely clueless tool just saying that ""my account has been hacked"" and see where that leads.

****

**EDITS**

Edit 22/01: Found an Ubisoft link directly pointing out if you lost email access. It requires daytime chat with them, so going to see if this path would help. Apparently not open on weekends?

Edit 22/01: I contacted the third party ISP out of curiosity if the 3rd party email address would be accessible. I was lucky and they told me that - yes - it is. As I was a customer for so long time, they accepted to restore my access to it without any cost for the end of the month. Now I have even access to the mailbox, but the recovery methods that Ubisoft have - are not sending any emails to the said email address. :D

****

Edit 23/01: No updates from Ubisoft on this yet. I updated my ticket by telling them that *""oh, there was no hacker after all - it was my account all along. I have restored access to it via a third party ISP by a stroke of luck (no other users registered the email address for them).*

Edit 23/01: Ubisoft personnel, please don't downvote this. Instead solve the issue you've caused!

Wow, what a week.

I have been fighting with Ubisoft to regain access to my Anno 1800 games after Ubisoft Connect forgot my details, and I could not log back into the account. All I get is various errors. So, I went to the Ubisoft support site to get help.

To my disappointment, they [shut down their live-chat support over a month ago](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/article/ubisoft-support-changes-to-live-support/000105563) in favour of using Discord, Twitter and Facebook. They provide an [account recovery form](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/contact?platform=29&game=50003&category=100&hideFields=all&af=1), which I filled in last weekend.

Usually, when you create a support ticket, you get an automated email telling you the ticket was created and someone will get back to you ASAP, but to my surprise, no email.....

Later that day, I questioned whether I had created a support ticket, so I tried again. This time, I took a screenshot of my ticket ID. A few days pass, and I get no response, so I go to the Discord server and ask in their support forum how long it would typically take to hear back. One of the Ubisoft employees told me that they could not give me that information and that I was off-topic. They then closed my request.

[The only response I have had from support thus far. tldr; not our problem, go away!](https://preview.redd.it/q2vjwtgsrkzb1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd6920656877d094320c839cfe6025ad31d421f)

I start talking to others on their Discord server and realise this is a far larger problem. Of the 19 active support topics in their Anno help section seven posted by other people are about similar issues, and all of them seem to be having issues getting support:

*Discord links: you have to be on their server to read these:*

1. [Ubisoft connect linked to the wrong account](https://discord.com/channels/863058244934696961/1172593837475102810)

4. [Game support doesn't work](https://discord.com/channels/863058244934696961/1171446358796943510)

7. [Anno 1800](https://discord.com/channels/863058244934696961/1171150217953955860)

Talking to one of the users, I realise that while tickets created under account recovery seem to get shredded - if we create tickets under billing (*aka the I am trying to give you money, but a bug on your site won't let my* category), I get the automatic email and the ticket shows up on my account page.

It really seems like Ubisoft has fired the customer support reps who help existing customers as part of their mass layoffs while keeping those who can continue to take in money.

Six days on, still no support, no access to a refund through Steam because I had played this game for more than two hours before the issue occurred, and all they do is send me back to [Ubisoft who ghost me and dozens if not hundreds of others](https://nz.trustpilot.com/review/www.ubisoft.com?stars=1) .

To take our money, give us a broken game we cannot use, and ghost us when trying to get any level of customer support is tantamount to theft.

I have filed a complaint against Ubisoft, with the New Zealand Commerce Commission, as I am fairly sure Ubisoft is [violating the Consumer Guarantees Act](https://www.consumerprotection.govt.nz/help-product-service/streaming-and-downloads/#:~:text=Digital%20products%20are%20covered%20by%20the%20Consumer%20Guarantees%20Act%20(CGA).%20Like%20all%20products%2C%20digital%20products%20must%20meet%20guarantees%20set%20out%20in%20the%20CGA%3A), which gives all New Zealanders the right to a refund, repair or replacement if a product they purchase is not fit for the purpose of which it was sold.

&#x200B;

**Call to action:**

If you, your friends or family have had any similar experience with Ubisoft, please post about it below. Give as much detail as you can; I hope we can gain enough attention to publicly embarrass Ubisoft into action.

p.s. It's nice to see that the company that cannot find time to support paying customers can find time to downvote their customer's criticism!

I ordered before them all, but they all preloaded when it never even appeared in my library so I contacted Ubi and well, the following mucking mess is the e x e m p l a r y service I received from Ubisoft support. In all fairness, some of them were stellar, others were as stock script drone brain dead as a chipped cinderblock.

Update 1: Some additional info to summarize, almost 3 weeks later I finally got my refund and it wasn't because of Ubisoft co-operating.  
Update 2: It's the 31st October and I'm still being told to just be patient and wait whilst the missing email they said they sent is investigated! Top class Ubi, t o p c l a s s

When i tried paying for the game, I tried to do so by adding the exact amount of funds (66.14) to my wallet. According to the uplay client, the transaction failed. yet my card was charged 66.14 - i saw it on my card transaction history. I then tried to use paypal to pay for the game, and again the client failed. Yet my paypal was charged. So now I have 2 66.14 charges on my credit card. 

Magically, my Ubisoft wallet has 132.28 (66.14\*2). So I thought I could use my wallet funds to pay. Nope. Even using wallet funds generates a client error (i refreshed my card transaction history like 100 times to make sure it didn't triple charge me). 

So now Ubisoft is holding on to my money it is stupid wallet and not letting me use it. What the fuck.

I have been trying to download Farcry 5 and Black Flag for about 3 months now with an open support ticket. I have tried all the troubleshooting steps online and suggested by Ubisoft. Ubisoft have provided no other support except generic advice I found online. I have never had issues downloading from any other platform like Steam. 

I have also reached out to them on Facebook and Messenger as it appears obvious no one is looking at it (sent my log files and IP info ages, and it's 'still being looked at'). 

I've also had my ticket closed four times while waiting for a response from **Ubisoft**. Pretty terrible customer service for a long time customer.

6sb3l8,mvmiller12,1502165542.0,Ubisoft and the modern gaming dilemma,6,3,"Well, it has been a while since she last attempted to do it, but my wife recently decided that she wanted to finally play through her Assassin's Creed games. I had gotten her the first game years ago and she liked it alot. So over the years I bought her AC2, Brotherhood, Revelations, (and apparently got a freebie of 3, but more on that later). But she never got around to finishing 1 at the time and now she was ready to go again. 

It started simply enough, I installed her disk of Assassin's Creed and away she went. She reached the end of the game and asked me to install the next one, so we sign into her Ubi account and there it is, AC2, and Brotherhood. But Revelations and 3 are both missing. I was concerned at first, but I decided to check my account instead. I've had this happen before where some Sims expansions were bought on MY account instead of hers, and EA moved them over with a simple phone call. Ubi should be at least as good, right?

Well, not so much. I call the Ubi support line, and apparently the phone agents can only help with accounts that can't be signed into. The agent was pleasant though, and opened up a ticket for me to complete so I could handle the issue with a live chat. A hair inconvenient, but not too bad. I completed the ticket with:

My wife owns Assassin's Creed: Revelations and Assassin's Creed III, and yet they seem to have been accidentally registered to my account instead of hers. She is now playing through the Assassin's Creed games and we have only just now discovered this issue. I would like for both of these games and keys to be moved from my Ubiplay account (redacted@redacted.com) and moved to hers instead (redacted@redacted.com). Thank you.

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:34:31 PM): Thank you for contacting Ubisoft Live Support. Please give me a moment to review your case. In the meantime, feel free to add any additional information that may pertain to your issue, and I will be with you shortly. 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:35:18 PM): Hello. Can you please upload your receipts for Assassin's Creed 3 and Revelations? 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:38:22 PM): I no longer have them 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:38:39 PM): I see. Where did you purchase these games? 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:38:47 PM): I don't remember 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:38:51 PM): This was years ago 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:39:08 PM): It took her a REALLY long time to collect all of those flags in Assassins Creed 1 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:39:52 PM): OK. We do need a receipt to transfer a game. I will also let you know the only version of AC3 you have is the free copy from the 30th anniversary celebration that cannot be moved 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:40:46 PM): Why does it matter if I have a legitimate key/version and no longer need it for it to be moved to her account? I'm not asking for another copy opf the game. I'm asking that it be moved 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:41:10 PM): Since I have it, and it is registered, and it is legit, you shouldn;t need anything else 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:41:23 PM): I do apologize, but that is the requirement for moving the game 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:41:38 PM): That is a load of garbage 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:41:55 PM): If I had physical disks this would not be a problem 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:42:21 PM): I had a similar problem with The Sims and EA, and they had no problem moving that 
either 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:42:37 PM): So why is Ubisoft deciding to be anti-consumer 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:42:38 PM): They have different policies than we do, as they are a different company 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:42:38 PM): ? 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:42:51 PM): Yes - a better one. Hence their better financials 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:42:55 PM): I do truly apologize, but we will need a receipt in order to transfer the games 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:43:07 PM): and they aren't fighting a hostile takeover by Guillemott 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:43:16 PM): THIS is how you lose customers 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:43:42 PM): I am making a simple request. PLease move the games from MY account to MY WIFE's 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:43:58 PM): One moment please 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:45:30 PM): I have verified that in order to move the game, we will need a valid proof of purchase, such as a receipt or invoice. If you do not have those, we cannot move the game. I do truly apologize for any inconvenience this may cause 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:46:07 PM): Why would you need a receipt when it is REGISTERED to my account? How else can you register a game to an account if you didn't buy it??? 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:46:25 PM): We require it to verify your purchase of the game from an approved vendor 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:46:36 PM): And after this chat I will continue to be able to play said game on MY account (which I don;t want to do) 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:46:57 PM): and will still be able to continue to receive apparently subpar support for it if I so choose 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:47:27 PM): And I don't care what you think of  whatever store I bought the game from 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:47:29 PM): That is what we will need to transfer the game. Is there anything else that I can assist you with today? 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:47:38 PM): Yes - move the game 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:47:44 PM): Or get me a manager who will 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:48:06 PM): No one else will move the game for you. If there is nothing else I can assist you with i will need to end this chat 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:48:34 PM): This is pathetic. It explains why you guys are doing so poorly though 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:48:58 PM): I am now boycotting future Ubi titles. Thanks for saving me future money 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:49:21 PM): I am very sorry you feel that way, but I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:49:39 PM): My day will be fine. I just need to log her into my account to play her game 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:49:53 PM): But I'm not purchasing any more Ubi games 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:50:01 PM): And I am telling everyone why. 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:50:24 PM): This was a simple customer service request, and you guys screwed it up. Congratulations 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:50:42 PM): I am sorry you feel that way, but this is the policy 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:51:03 PM): I would advise your corporate masters to rethink their policies 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:51:14 PM): I will absolutely forward your feedback 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:51:19 PM): Please do


I will admit I was a little heated by the end there, but this is pretty ridiculous. If game companies are going to insist on digital sales and this is the best they can do in this kind of situation, then I think we all need to have a serious discussion digital purchased from publishers about their custodianship of the games we bought.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/6sb3l8/ubisoft_and_the_modern_gaming_dilemma/,2017-08-08 12:12:22

Me (9/7/2019, 12:18:53 PM): I tried signing up for the free trial of uplay+ a few days ago, and it still wont let me sign up. it puts me in a site loop. I was able to do it through the website, and add games to my account, but when I try downloading and playing them on the client it says my subscription has expired. clicking renew gives me another broken link 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:19:49 PM): Also it has charged my card twice, the 2nd time I tried resubscribing it told me there was a problem with my payment and it couldnt continue, even though it charged my card immediatley after that. and I still have no access 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:20:09 PM): Thank you for reaching out to us about this. The charges are an authorization request sent to your financial institution. These charges will drop in a few days. I apologize for any confusion caused by this. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:20:43 PM): Ok why did it charge me twice and then give me an error message the 2nd time saying it couldnt charge it, but did anyway 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:20:53 PM): also, i still have no access too my trail 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:21:14 PM): Additionally, we are aware of an issue affecting some subscribers where the subscription shows as expired when they have an active subscription.

 The developers are in the process of investigating the issue, and we hope to have a resolution in the coming days. 
Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:21:42 PM): You may have been charged twice as the system hadn't flagged you for having a subscription yet, and sent another authorization hold. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:21:59 PM): so that being said, is our trail time going to be extended? it seems alot of people are having this issue with no answers, also no way to cancel 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:22:26 PM): a month long trail isnt accurate when you dont have access too it  

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:22:59 PM): I understand your concern and feedback. We do not currently have any more information on this issue at this time, however we are working as quickly as we can to restore access to our subscribers. We appreciate your continued patience with this. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:23:48 PM): so if its not fixed for another week or 2, or at all...we basically are gonna lose the free trail time we were promised and with no way to cancel be charged for a service that dont work? 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:24:05 PM): seems kinda like a scam to me. a bit shady... 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:24:22 PM): I can understand why you would feel that way. We are working on making sure this does not happen and that we have access restored. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:24:24 PM): not good PR for a new service or as a publisher in general at the very least

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:24:33 PM): Did you have any other questions for us at this time? 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:24:55 PM): right but the issue is we are being charged for a free month long trial that isnt being delivered with no answers 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:25:18 PM): The authorization hold is a pending charge that will be refunded. I'm sorry that there was any confusion about this. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:25:42 PM): again, are we gonna be credited for this or is our trial gonna end and we are not going to get our full 30 days 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:26:13 PM): I do not have any information on potential compensation for this at this time. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:26:23 PM): if its not fixed for 2 weeks, does our month trial start when its fixed, or are we losing 2 weeks of a month trail due to an error on ubisofts part 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:27:24 PM): well the company staying silent and refusing to acknowledge is just making the situation worse. especially for an already high 15 a month. not a good 1st impression 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:27:53 PM): We are aware of this, and we are working to resolve this issue as soon as possible. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:27:57 PM): cant imagine many people continuing to support them, me included 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:28:42 PM): will we get an email once the service up? or do they plan on staying silent on that as well, hope people forget and then charge thier card on oct 1st 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:28:43 PM): Any updates on this ongoing issue will be posted to our support page and also the official forums.
 
Me (9/7/2019, 12:29:43 PM): How do I cancel to keep from being charged after this ""trial"" is over

Me (9/7/2019, 12:30:08 PM): it seems its impossible to cancel as well.  

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:31:17 PM): When service has been restored, we will be able to cancel this for you. As long as the cancellation is processed before October 1st, you will not be charged. Since this issue is preventing an active subscription from being on your account, you will not be charged. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:32:05 PM): I see I have an active service on the website, but not the uplay client however.  

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:32:32 PM): That's the issue we are trying to resolve. The website is showing an active subscription, but it is not active on our side. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:33:23 PM): so, it does show an active subscription on one end but not the other, so what would prevent it from being charged if its not resolved by the 1st 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:33:40 PM): Since we don't have a subscription on our end, you won't be charged. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:34:30 PM): As I said Ive already had 2 charges now on my card, a third will cause me to file a fraud report and chargeback with my bank 

Anthony W (9/7/2019, 12:34:49 PM): I've mentioned before that the pending charges on your statements are authorization holds that will not finalize and will be refunded to you. 

Me (9/7/2019, 12:37:21 PM): Ok. I guess I will wait to hear an official statement. If the company dont make good on this it will kill uplay+ before it starts. if our trial isnt extended thats false advertising and not gonna go over well with customers. And from what ive been hearing its already left a pretty bad taste in peoples mouths.

If this is the quality of the service they are providing then they can expect alot of future customers including myself not to pay at all.  
Sometimes IT issues take a few hours to fix if its high profile, but days means there is a lack of focus or some serious issues with the service and they actually have no clue how to fix it. 

 Alot of other players have also said to simply create a new account as a workaround but as COG\_Sovaka put it on the forums

""Most definitely not....  


I think its a clear indicator of the Left hand not knowing what the Right hand is doing.  


They've got multiple ways to trouble shoot this issue.  
One of them is to look at the process they've set in place for adding/editing database fields/entries.  


Then all they need to do is look at affected accounts database side and see what isn't being set or flagged.  
Or, if its being assigned to a cron job to save resources, look at its process as to what it should be doing and checking against a borked account.  


Like this fix should be one of the easiest from a database admin perspective.  


Why it hasn't been fixed probably comes down to one or multiple ""teams"" trying to resolve the issue don't have access or aren't allowed direct access to the user account databases.  
I can guaran-damn-tee you this is a simple case of during the signup process, some ""programmer"" failed to error catch their code and only half the code ran and the other half never got to run due to the error.  


However, I have nfi how they haven't put into action a simple database update fix to account for this mistake.  
Perhaps they instantly fired the people responsible and now they've got people who aren't familiar with the system trying to fix it, or they're in panic mode trying to hire someone to fix it.  
If they haven't hired someone yet, then we've got a hell of a wait on our hands as they need to get someone and bring them up to speed on the issue. ""

Every time I get a response, it's always a different person who thinks they have the run down but get a detail incorrect, I try to correct it, no response for a month, then a new employee repeats the same steps asks for more information, I give them the information, no response for 2-4 weeks. 

I then get a NEW person. Who tells me the only way I can relink my account is if I access my compromised/deleted email. Literally the entire reason I opened this ticket was because I cannot access it. I have given Ubisoft every little bit of information they could possibly need to prove my identity, minus maybe my social #, and it seems impossible for these customer service reps to actually do their job and identify me as the owner.

I was so excited to play your gorgeous games on a 30 series Nvidia graphics card and have load times cut with a high performance CPU. The main game I wanted to jump into immediately was AC: Valhalla.

I was even excited at the prospect of the subscription service Ubisoft+. You mean instead of paying $60 for a new release game I can pay $15/month for the entire game and all its DLC's? And I'd probably be done with it within a month or two... Sign me up!

The problem, and the reason I'm taking to Reddit to vent is: Ubisoft Connect

Within a 2hr play session of Valhalla, Ubisoft Connect unexpectedly quit/crashed 5 times. This is pretty much the norm of my experience. I spent more time relaunching and loading the game than actually playing it. This, to me, is unacceptable. These games deserve better than this, and the developers who made these games deserve better. It's not like I get any other option either. Even if I bought the games outright, it would force me to launch them through Ubisoft Connect. Even when I bought AC:Odyssey through Steam (before subscribing to Ubisoft+) I would launch it in Steam, but then it would re-route through Ubisoft Connect. If I ever actually get to a 'completed' state with Valhalla, I will promptly cancel my Ubisoft+ membership and delete the trash that is Ubisoft Connect from my hard drive. It's just such an incredible disappointment. If you require your customers to operate your games on proprietary software, you should really make sure said software works.

Rewind about an hour ago, I got some inspiration from a couple youtube videos to play Trials Evolution Gold. I've owned this game since the day it came out, but I rarely ever play because my main computer doesn't have uplay since 99% of my games are on steam. Anyways, I try to login, but can't remember my exact password. No big deal, I'll just go reset the damn thing. NOPE. I'm suspended for (3) failed login attempts. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? No notice of how long the suspension is, so I start searching the web to see how long this shit's gonna take. A lot of people are saying it's only 30 mins to an hour. Ok, well it's been almost 2 hours for me and I'm still suspended. A twitter post says that resetting your password again should reset my suspension status and let me in. Ok, still suspended >_> At this point i'm about to try to contact ubisoft customer service via email, but when I get to their website.... I need to fucking sign in to contact support?!? WTF

10obkpa,PurplePrincesss,1675009503.0,Ubisoft chasing away players with Ubisoft connect,6,11,"This is a rant post, I'm so fed up and sad! I'm a BIG Assassin's creed fan, have been since I was a kid and have played all the games! The three newest games are not my favorites but I still enjoy them and I want to play them but Ubisoft seems to try and make me stop.

I've had some issues with Uplay/Ubisoft connect the last few years but at least it kept me ingame, now it's just unbearable!  I'm trying to play Valhalla but I get kicked out of the game, disconnected and have to log back in to ubisoft connect several times a day. Since I have an authenticator this is very annoying! It also sometimes jumps back several saves when I get kicked out. I opened a ticket mid December and got one answer early January with a list of stuff to try, I did try them and let them know it didn't help and haven't heard a word back since then. I have tried googling the issue to try and fix it myself and found out ALOT of people have the same issues or worse and posts are dating back years without it being fixed! I got sick of it and tried to play Brotherhood instead, my all time favorite, but the same thing happened there!

This is literally breaking my heart, this game from my childhood I have so many memories from is destroyed for no reason at all. I can't even replay the old games anymore. Ubisoft connect is useless, there is no reason to force people through it in a solo game with no online content. I payed for the games, I should be able to play them when I want! And the customer service is terrible, seems like all they care about now is money!

Im really hoping they will fix this but I have a bad feeling they wont! They have probably done the math and see that they are making enough money anyway so there is no point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/10obkpa/ubisoft_chasing_away_players_with_ubisoft_connect/,2023-01-30 00:25:03

Full story (kinda): I got the game  gifted on my account on steam, then when i opeend the game i was apparently playing on a different ubisoft account, it as my brothers who had the deluxe version. then i log out of uplay, try to log into my own account and then play rainbow six but i cant cause it keeps saying theres a problem authenticating my ownership. 

i tried making a new account for uplay but it wont work. im out of options here and i cant get the purchase history nor the activation code cause steam doesn't show them as options.    now the main problem here is that i haven't really connected or opened a ubisoft account prior to this, I the first time i ever opened r6 i got this bug. 

 I've tried multiple times to get into contact with customer service but i cant at all, live chat is constantly turned off and when i did submit a ticket, its been a long while and still no attention to it.

ypt820,TinyGloom,1667929428.0,What the hell is Ubisoft's customer service?!,5,16,"Ok.. I'm here in part to rant but also to seek any advice because I'm actually at my wits end.

Back in September my email was hacked. I was in contact with Microsoft about how best to deal with the situation but it was decided that deleting the account was the best option. Which I did.

Unfortunately, I completely forgot I had a ubisoft account attached to that email address. Woe is me!

When I realized the error of my ways, I immediately email ubisoft's support team and explain the problem, because when  you log into their customer service area, one of the first support link options is ""I no longer have access to the email linked to my ubisoft account""  and they seemingly boast about being able to help.

The first response asks for screenshots for proof of purchase, which I completely understand. After MUCH back and forth, they now have screenshots of every single game I own, purchase history, proof of purchase, CD key -- whole shebang. Currently, I am confident the only thing they do not have of mine is my blood type.

eventually after speaking to 10+ agents (as soon as I would get to the front of the queue and give my details, they just started closing the chat on me) I finally had someone tell me that they will escalate the situation for me but couldn't confirm how long that would take.

&#x200B;

we come to today - roughly 2 months later. I get an email stating that they've looked over everything and they cannot help me with my issue and I should just log into the email address and change things myself.

which I cant do.... Because the email address no longer exists. (Microsoft cannot revive email addresses either! I asked them!!).

I threaten to seek legal advice on how to proceed because this has been going on for 2 months now and I'm ashamed to have done business with them.

They come back with requests of new screenshots because they should be able to help now (amazing...) So we begin the dance again. They ask for the same screenshots I have already provided and confirm that everything matches.

They've just now decided that despite all of this, they cannot help me because THE EMAIL ADDRESS THEY HAVE ON FILE DOES NOT MATCH THE ONE I AM ASKING THEM TO CHANGE IT TO !!!

Am I missing something here? Are they actually able to help people recover accounts if you can't access email addresses anymore, or is this one giant troll to customers?

I feel like I'm stuck in some kind of sick hell loop.  


edit/ update: 

They gave me more runaround BS so I responded to the correspondence stating I'm going to seek legal advice and I need them to confirm that ""the following statements are true and accurate"" and outlined everything that had happened up until that point.   


Suddenly Ubisoft is able to verify my account using other means such as an OTP that had been established on my account. This wasn't a viable option until I threatened them with a legal party.

jvt093,SoulessPanic,1605619897.0,Do not use your credit card for Ubisoft+ | Legal complain inbound.,6,2," Let me start saying that this it doesn't matter if it's 15euros,500 or 5.000.It's about the illegal practise(this just seems plain scam) in this situation and no respect shown towards consumer.I have never seen something like this ever before, even with small companies nevermind huge corporations like Ubisoft.  


So like most of you, i paid for Ubisoft+ yesterday using my credit card. Got the invoice via e-mail, downloaded the game i wanted to play and then suddenly my account got suspended. I immediately contacted customer support and they gave me the link for the FAQ they have in the announcement and they told me that the funds are on hold from my financial institution(bank) and that it depends by them on when my money will be released. This seemed reasonable.  


Now the ""funny"" part. I went to my bank today to check on this. What they told me is that the funds are NOT on hold from their side but instead it's on hold till 6th of December(!) by Ubisoft. I asked them if i can cancel the transaction and they told me i can't until the funds are released by Ubisoft on 6th of December.  


I contacted customer support again and after calling on their lies he told me to provide them with some information from my side(bank transaction, last card numbers etc.) and that he would forward this to Ubisoft+ team for further investigation. Of course, he told me he cannot provide with timeframe for response from Ubisoft+ team.  


Now, in their FAQ they state :  


""While this request is processed, the funds are not transferred to Ubisoft, but put on hold. This temporary hold is cancelled daily by Ubisoft, though it may take more time for your financial institution to release the funds back to you. They will be able to give you more information about authorisation holds policy.""  


Simply put what they state on the FAQ are NOT true as i described above. The temporary hold has not been canceled and my bank cannot release the funds back to me.  


Now, i spoke with my lawyer and he told me that if Ubisoft do not release the hold or provide me with the subscription i payed for until the end of the day we can form a legal complain through the bank. I am also waiting for the respone from Ubisoft+ team.  


This situation is outrageous and unaccaptable.  


I will provide the transcipts with the contacts i had with customer support. PLEASE DO NOT DELETE, ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION HAVE BEEN BLANKED OUT.

Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:25:04 PM): I understand that you have been charged for Ubisoft+ but the subscription is suspended?  


Me (11/16/2020, 9:25:56 PM): Hello, yes that's the case. I purchased it got the receipt downloaded the game and then it was suspended. I checked my bank records and money was transfered  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:26:58 PM): Upon investigating the subscription, I have to inform you that there is no processed payment in our system. The charges visible in your payment account are on authorisation hold from the payment provider.  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:27:45 PM): These charges should be temporary and the funds will be returned back to your payment account once released. For an accurate time frame on when the funds will be released, I kindly advise you to contact your payment provider/bank.  


Me (11/16/2020, 9:28:30 PM): Okay, but can you tell why the transaction wasn't completed. Do you require to have more than 15.00EUR in the credit card for it to pass the transaction ?  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:29:43 PM): The issue might be caused by many factors, I suggest to check the billing details for special characters, as they could cause this issue.  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:30:04 PM): The subscription is 14,99 Euro, if you have 15 it will be enough.  


Me (11/16/2020, 9:30:15 PM): I've seen many people suggest to do it with PayPal, do you think it would be better ?  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:31:19 PM): If possible, I do suggest to try with another payment method as that has helped with similar issues.  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:31:33 PM): If you are adding a another payment method, please also select it as default.  


Me (11/16/2020, 9:31:48 PM): Last question, is it possible to pay via Revolut ?  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:33:25 PM): All available payment options are listed on the checkout page, if the option for Revolut is not shown it might cause this issue.  


Me (11/16/2020, 9:34:10 PM): Okay, i will wait to get the funds back and try again. Thanks for the assistance.  


Ubi-Software (11/16/2020, 9:34:55 PM): Happy to help! Should you have questions or need assistance, feel free to contact us again. I wish you a wonderful day!

Me (11/17/2020, 1:51:52 PM): I know it's not your fault or anything, but this is really annoying and absurd.  


Me (11/17/2020, 1:53:23 PM): I spoke with a colleague of yours yesterday and he told me what the money for subscription is on hold from my bank and will be released on their scheduling. I went to my bank today and that's not the case. The funds are on hold from Ubisoft side till 6th of December !  


Ubi-Cbraskov (11/17/2020, 1:53:58 PM): From what I understand you have paid for Ubisoft+ and not received the service.  
Me (11/17/2020, 1:54:22 PM): Indeed, i paid for it. Got the receipt, downloaded the game and then it was suspended.  


Ubi-Cbraskov (11/17/2020, 1:56:38 PM): OK, after checking your account I can see that the payments have failed. Please find our article below regarding failed payments:

Me (11/17/2020, 1:58:15 PM): Ubisoft are litteraly holding the money without provided the service for it.  


Me (11/17/2020, 1:58:43 PM): That is confirmed by my bank, the funds are NOT holded by the bank, can you explain that to me please ?  


Me (11/17/2020, 1:59:13 PM): And are on hold till the 6th of December !  


Me (11/17/2020, 2:00:37 PM): This request appears as an authorisation for roughly the same amount as your subscription. It is an important step to protect our customers. While this request is processed, the funds are not transferred to Ubisoft, but put on hold. This temporary hold is cancelled daily by Ubisoft, though it may take more time for your financial institution to release the funds back to you. They will be able to give you more information about authorisation holds policy.  


Me (11/17/2020, 2:00:43 PM): This is from the FAQ  


Me (11/17/2020, 2:02:24 PM): It says the temporary hold is cancelled daily by Ubisoft, and it says that my bank is responsible for returning the funds back to me. Which is not the case since tha bank told me they are on hold from Ubisoft side.  


Me (11/17/2020, 2:02:52 PM): Are you here, Sir/Madam ?  


Ubi-Cbraskov (11/17/2020, 2:03:44 PM): Please give me a moment.

1dlwxql,Tank2B-1986,1719066578.0,Reconsider Watchdogs,5,15,"

I have been a long fan of Ubisoft games, from the old-school Assassin Creed games to the classic Prince of Persia. I have been very impressed by how the team has pushed forward into one of the most world-renowned video game companies in the gaming business. To that, I have run across articles stating Ubisoft's intention to table quite a few games in order to focus on a large abundance of Assassin Creed games. Now, don't get me wrong, I can comprehend the need to put some things on hold to focus on others. It is a respectful way of approaching tasks so you can get the level of polish necessary to increase the level of success. I just believe that Ubisoft is tabling, indefinitely, Watch Dogs at a time when I think the gaming community could use this intellectual property.

I have played all three Watch Dogs and truly fell in love with the series starting with Watch Dogs 2. The approach to WD2 was not only an attractive packaging but it also captivated a lot of fun to the gaming loop. With every minute I played WD2, I found myself torn between making money from doing side missions so I could dress up my main character and forwarding the story which had me laughing from one adventure to another. It was, in my opinion, a very long game, but it was nothing like the Assassin Creed games of late. Honestly, that is another reason why the game was so approachable. The world that was created for WD2 just seemed to be a very decent blend that resulted in such a satisfying conclusion that had me waiting for Watch Dogs 3. Of course, everything can't always be good and I acknowledge that there aren't any games that I have come across that I'd consider perfect, so my constructive criticism is warranted.

One of the biggest issues with WD2 is the single playable character. To me, Ubisoft crafted such fun and loveable characters that it was a shame that we didn't get a chance to take them out in the field. The story was focused on DedSec's adventure and expansion of their popularity, which makes sense. I just think we could have had a chance to expand the gamer's attachment to these characters so that they hold more of an impact on the story as we scurry to the conclusion. In my opinion, it may seem minor, but in regards to the story, I can't help but hold interest in the members who were already established. Especially after finalizing the DLC. That would have been the perfect moment to allow us to play as our favorite DedSec members.

My other gripe wasn't anything apparent to me until I was highly engrossed in Watch Dogs 3. That gripe was the limited animation that Marcus had at his disposal. Marcus was such a capable fighter with his unbreakable ball and rope, but from the tutorial of the game to the final mission, your takedowns, and attacks seemed far too limited. It isn't all doom and gloom because the parkour animations are outstanding and even though they greatly fixed in Watch Dogs 3, they didn't carry over the parkour animation to WD3.

Nothing could extinguish my excitement for the next chapter in the newly established DedSec community and for everything I was excited about, it didn't disappoint. The intro to Watch Dogs 3 was exceptional. The agent that we had at our disposal introduced us to the controls but also introduced us to the animation takedowns that would fuel every minute of my time in this game. This inspired me to play through the game not just once, or twice but three times and still play to this day. I feel that Ubisoft has crafted a world and scenario that was grounded in realism with a sprinkle of sci-fi technology that made players feel capable but not unstoppable.

I could probably write another page about the animations alone but I want to just
commend the dedication in allowing the animators to fully approach all the game's animation with such fluidity and artistic flare. The game does something rare that other games don't and that is rewarding players who test outside their comfort zone and discover all the other characters who have unique capabilities or skills. The silence of the nail gun, the defibrillator, the sledgehammer, and even a hypnosis pendant all make each character feel unique and a joy to use. Hand-to-hand combat had a fun yet challenging rock-paper-scissors aspect to it and the gunplay in the game wasn't perfect but fit the character's skill level for most people since they weren't all mercenaries who had experience with weapons.

The story does take hold of your emotions once you start to unravel how DedSec is being weaponized to further the agenda of multiple bad actors. More so, the betrayal that is revealed truly motivated every one of my following mission success so that we can get back at this person whom we trusted. Again, ending the story left me in the same place as WD2 did; anticipating the next approach to the DedSec situation.

Just like WD2, WD3 isn't immune to constructive criticism. I love the game but the running animation was a bit awkward in my opinion. Especially in comparison to Marcus and his parkour capabilities. It just seemed like something that could have been duplicated from WD2 or executed better. It was nothing game-breaking but it felt like a step backwards from WD2.

I also think the limitation of weapons being used dependent on the recruited person was
warranted and a bit annoying. Let me explain what I mean. The secret agent, who had a silenced pistol, probably would have training in multiple weapons. I am ex-military and we may have had an assigned weapon, but we still touched a lot of the other weapons the military uses. In my opinion, I would have allowed them to use other weapons that others had at their disposal. Maybe making the Hitman or Agents rarer to find or more difficult to recruit. I also think you could have had a leveling system for each person you recruited, unlocking weapons and skills as they gained experience. This would have
been a challenging task for your team but the reward would have outweighed that work. Every takedown, headshot, and escaped alert would fuel those levels and unlock other things for this player. Even allowing some sort of customization to each character you have recruited increases the hurt the player felt when this person was killed in action.

Honestly, those are the main things that I felt could have truly been enhanced. Maybe adding a few more gadgets for our use would have been acceptable as well, but that can be something I look forward to in the next Watch Dogs. Speaking of such, I have a lot of ideas on the direction you could go with this next game if you ever get around to making it. 

The first thing I don't want you to do is jump deeper into sci-fi. As I stated above, the blend Ubisoft has come up with in WD3 was perfect. Cloaking, armored enemies, and drones that attack and pursue our characters are great obstacles for a game like this. We can always push this a tad bit further by adding a limited exo-suit enemy and attacking mechanical animals that can also cause each mission a bit of a headache. Obviously, this will have to be offset by more animation and tactical weapons and tools to neutralize these threats. I have faith that Ubisoft will be able to add these and other additions that don't usher the world, that has been built, into a ""Star Wars"" type realm.

I would love for Ubisoft to bring back the recruitment that was added in WD3. Just expand the occupations that the random generator is allowed to toy with and add the aforementioned leveling system so that they can start as a street mime who can only use an electric gun and get to be a capable DedSec member who can learn an artistic takedown or have tech that can EMP the entire block. Do add the ability to fully make your character the way you want, even if that means adding a character customization generator so that you can have one person, probably your first DedSec member, whom you can truly build up and design. Perhaps give that character a longer leveling up pathway who can truly be an omega agent but still require an occupation to start the character creation. If he is imprisoned, that's where your recruited members come into play. Require that he be rescued and dependent on the severity of the crime, meaning the number of stars that were accumulated before the arrest, will dictate how difficult the mission is to recover our agent. 

Vehicles in the game were serviceable but maybe add other unique modes of transportation. Skateboards seem silly but could be fun. Especially if you add that into the takedowns. Rollerblades, bikes, jet skis, and even unlockable hoverboards would be extremely interesting and add enough technology that doesn't remove the grounded feel that has been established. Weapons would fall into this as well. I would love to see an agent who is a sushi chef have the ability to do knife takedowns and knife throws for silent distant takedowns. Maybe just limit his overall weapon capability initially until he levels up enough to expand what he is capable of using.

Ubisoft was great at linking each WD to one another and I wouldn't stop doing that with the fourth edition either. Maybe have missions that mention other members of DedSec and even allow them to accompany you on specific missions. I know that could be asking a lot but it would truly set the game apart from other Ubisoft games. Even if you are just allowing them to join our character in main missions initially, it would still be amazing to have Marcus testing our skills or Aiden being our mentor. The real showstopper of linking IPs to WD was the Assassin's Creed crossover. Not only was it written very well, but it also used the London setting of past Assassin Creed to justify the existence of the location which placed the events of Assassin Creed Syndicate in the same world as WD. I think this could be pushed further with another crossover with WD and Assassin Creed and try crossing over Division, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, or even Raving Rabbids (Rabbids would be ideal for clothing designs and movie posters).

The level design for WD games is phenomenal and if you can keep that consistsstent, it will continue to be great. Not sure what location would be ideal, but I'd contemplate creating another city like was done with London, or creating a chain of islands that could allow us to have different experiences in different locations. Regardless of locale, consider expanding the headquarters for DedSec and adding some minor customizations like items you pick up or mission-specific rewards. Maybe a place where you can see all the legendary masks hanging from the wall. More interior locations would be welcome and have the player's character be able to interact with the outside environment from the interior environment. Adds a level of emergence and gives you a little more capability against the Al as they ascend on our masked player who is attempting to avoid arrest.

Co-op in the main storyline would be much appreciated but never required. Most of the time, co-op through the main story tends to make the game a lot easier to get through because you can rely on another person to revive you or guide you through the game. To counter this, up the difficult level by one when another person is added. I can imagine it will be surprising to think you can just run around hacking and killing without any strategy just because you have a friend join your game. WD is a game about planning and stealth, with the ability to go tactical when things go chaotic. Let's embrace that factor and emphasize the need to continue using your technological tools and strategic thinking.

Weapon customization should be added as well. I love changing the designs of my weapons but adding a few sights, or under barrel attachments would further flush out the gameplay. Adding a leveling function to the all the games weapons would also be outstanding. Customizing the knives, brass knuckles, and whatever else is decided on to be used would be very attractive to gamers. Reaching into the creativity to even create other tools that can be used, and customized. I would have loved to have
had a parachute with the DedSec logo on it. I spent a lot of time utilizing the construction drone that our character could ride, that I started thinking of ways to approach missions in unusual ways. Adding the approach from above would further the approach to missions. Floating in from above, dropping on top of a lookout with that takedown animation from above would be a perfect way to start some of those missions.

Honestly, I was motivated to do this because of the article I read saying that there is another Ghost Recon being created. I welcome another Ghost Recon game, especially since it was one of the first games I played way back in the day. However, I wanted to point out the potential that exist with an IP that was easily shelved. We look at the sales and the critics and tend to feel that it is a waste to take another risk on an IP that hasn't found its footing quite yet in the gaming world. Monster Hunter was the exact same way but Capcom kept pressing forward and their hard work was finally rewarded by increasing sales by roughly 17 million. Ubisoft is one of the most talented gaming companies in my lifetime, and WD is an IP I desperately want to see succeed. I just think that shelving WD indefinitely could set it back especially at a time where I believe the world could us a game that attempts to bring justice to the games society by shining a light on the corruption that we are seeing in our real life.

I truly do hope this message finds each person willing to read it well and that it gives Ubisoft a chance to think and see that fans, not just me, are passionate about this IP. 

Take care, stay blessed, and good luck with the future.

So if anyone is in the same position after reseting practically everything (e.g network, fresh ubisoft connect, password, etc...)

End all Ubisoft processes on taskmanager including background processes. 

Go into the Firewall settings on your Windows, and approve every single program found in ""Program Files (x86)\\Ubisoft\\Ubisoft Game Launcher""

This includes: 

* UbisoftConnect.exe
* UbisoftGameLauncher.exe
* UbisoftGameLauncher64.exe
* Uninstall.exe
* upc.exe
* UplayCrashReporter.exe
* UplayService.exe
* UplayWebCore.exe

Allow them access on both the Private and Public network setting.

Then try logging in.

What you need to do a story on his how a huge company like ubisoft can charge their loyal customers who preorder their game 2x as much as non pre orders and then not only not get them the game on the release date but not even respond with answers to customers they scammed ..normal people can call ubisoft and they don't responded when you open their claims..here is my wifes example....I still have no access ...........


 I preorder the game spent 125.00 on a special exclusive package for my husband's birthday bc he was a huge fan he owns EVERY title. You sold me a extra shipping guarantee for 25.00 MORE so I could be sure he could play it on. His birthday yesterday morning I was email a label creation for his present. As of today its still sitting somewhere on a desk the tracking shows it not even being dropped off yet. So today he is sitting watching others playing a game I pre-order him months ago and paid almost 2x the amount people are paying today to download and enjoy bc they we smart enough to buy into your EXCLUSIVE PRE-ORDER.  And on top of everything else I can't tell him anything about his present because your joke of a non existing customer service department won't even respond. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND HONESTLY SEEMS MORE LIKE A SCAM!! HE OWNS 6 TITLES SO SAYING WE WERE LOYAL CUSTOMERS IS A UNDERSTAMENT!! I DONT HAVE THE A EXRA 100 BUCKS TO BUY THE DIGITAL VERSION TODAY SO HE COULD AT LEAST SALVAGE SOME OF HIS BIRTHDAY HES BEEN WAITING FOR MONTHS AND I HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE SOMEWHERE TO GET OFF THEIR ASS AND PUT IT IN THE MAIL STILL THIS IS LIKE A BAD JOKE...SOMEONE GIVE US INFORMATION AT THE LEAST.

11lgmax,kevo1124,1678235026.0,Far Cry 6 PSO Cache Launch Crash - Customer Service Refuses to Assist for 4 Months,4,0,"I need some actual real tech support assistance. I purchased Far Cry 6 during the black Friday sale, downloaded it right away and a few hours attempted to play it for the first time. However, it would not launch at all. It would get stuck on the ""Warming up PSO Cache"" window, where the program would stop responding at that point. I tried various methods I found online that other ppl suggested to try, to no luck.

I immediately reached out to the official Ubisoft customer support and told them everything that was going on. I asked the agent at that very moment if he believed you guys could provide a solution, because I then would not request a refund for the game and give you guys a chance. The agent even said that if we couldn't get the game to work, that I would be able to get my money back as clearly I'm not getting what I paid for at all. During that initial customer service request, we tried numerous solutions to with the same result of crash on launch window. The agent said it was something that needed to be sent onto the ""game team"" so that they could take a deeper look into my issue.

I had recently reinstalled windows 11 a few weeks prior to this, as I needed to reinstall in order to turn on core isolation in the windows security suite. Everything was set up correctly, no bloatware (personal built PC with own personal copy of windows), no antivirus other than defender, no customizations of programs or background settings; none of that. It was no different than if someone had purchased a brand new laptop or pre-built and the first game they played when they got home was Far Cry 6.

It has now been 4 months and I haven't heard anything. The last attempt was asking me to send dxdiag and screenshots of my startup apps by doing selective start way back when I originally requested assistance. I have not heard anything or been asked anything at all. So a couple weeks ago I reached out and said that at this point I just would like my refund, as that way I can go purchase the PS5 or I'd at least not have a complete waste of money purchase from you guys. I was told that it has been too long and that I can no longer get a refund. I was told that if I gave you guys a chance to find a solution, that I could still get a refund if we couldn't find a solution. I gave you guys a chance and you guys didn't even try to help me.

Just to be clear, I would still MUCH rather find a solution to get the game running than get a refund. But if getting the game to run is not an option, then you guys should at least do the right thing here and refund me.

Long rant short, here's what went down:

* I bought Ubisoft+ ($15/mo) in order to play AC Valhalla on my PC
* **The game crashed at launch, right after intro videos, before I can navigate the menu**
* I spent a couple hours trying fixes (plenty with this issue over the last few years) and nothing was working 
   * Ubisoft conveniently closed the megathread on their forums saying the issue has been solved in 2021, people have had it happening since launch
* I decided to buy AC Valhalla for $65, thinking it might be an authentication issue with the U+ subscription
* Ubisoft Connect was so buggy, it charged me twice for AC Valhalla ($135 something with tax)
* The game still crashed at launch (total ""play time"": <10 minutes)
* **I opened a Support ticket with Ubisoft on August 1st requesting a refund for both charges of AC Valhalla**
* Duplicate charge was refunded, but they refuse to refund the 1st $65 charge for the broken AC Valhalla I have never been able to play

Since then, **14 different Ubisoft ""support"" reps have replied to my case**, all saying my order is ""*ineligible for a refund*"". They have requested my MSinfo & DxDiag files multiple times, which I keep sending but they always blame another application.

* I have 67 games installed on my PC, not a single one of them crashes, only AC Valhalla at launch. And yet Ubisoft ""support"" blames programs like Razer Synapse and my monitor running at 100hz...

My favorite response: *""After investigation I am not sure what part of your system does not qualify the minimum system requirements. If you can let us know, then we can investigate further. Otherwise* ***I am afraid*** ***we will have to deny the request for refund****.""*

* Right, as I've always said, my system is not the issue. It's with AC Valhalla. I run a RTX 3070, 32GB RAM, Ryzen 5 5600X...  

Throughout the last month, they've also made me verify my email about 5x (as in I wait days for a response and they reply with ""*verify your email before we can support you further*""... Just insane loop holes to do anything they can to not refund me the $65. 

This will be the last time I buy a Ubisoft game. Absolutely terrible customer service, it blows my mind. **Steam would have refunded this purchase no questions asked**, because the play time was <2 hours.

Hey guys, I wanted to share something that’s been happening in the past couple of days in Ranked Rainbow Six Siege in Champ lobbies on PlayStation. 

Got on the game yesterday ready to enjoy some ranked with my squad. First game on, we matched up against a full stack of Xbox players. Before the map ban, one of the players on the opposite team instantly leaves. The other team DOES NOT cancel the game. That’s the first sign. We win the first round. Second round starts and everyone on my team can’t drone, meaning it won’t move but the timer of the round keeps running down. Once it hits 0:00, the game freezes and everyone on my team including me get kicked out the game. The game gives us the option to reconnect but we get an error and it takes us back to the menu. Once you’re back in the menu you get a ban.

The opposite team is rewarded RP points and can continue playing while we get an abandon sanction, RP penalty and a temporary ban. Because this is the third time it happens to me, I caught a 24h ban.

We contacted Ubisoft and explained the situation to which they answered: «  the problem isn’t our servers, it’s your internet connection. Here are some tips and tricks on how to better you connection. » 

Thanks Ubi, that’s incredibly helpful. 

I’m not worried about Ubisoft’s fantastic customer service, but rather the fact that they can’t identify this problem on their end, meaning that these attacks will continue on unpunished. 

I made my peace with the fact that I won’t be getting these RP points back through a rollback but what I cannot accept is the fact that I won’t be able to play on my account because if it happens again I’ll be banned for a week.

My goal here is to make sure the issue is known, so please share and comment and whatever Reddit does best because I’m out of options here and we need to band together as a community for the health of our favorite game.

Respectfully,

Just take a look at these pics below, how long have we been dealing with a simple concern that can be answered with a ""Yes, we can help you, here's what you need to do"" or ""No, we can't"".

I contacted Ubi support because I saw AC Valhalla was on sale on PC. Well...... Everyone knows when there's a sale on PC it's more than a steal. Not like in PS, their sale like they don't even what to sale it in the first place, just a ridiculous policy on PS.

Since they are replying for too long the first sale was gone. Yep, that's how long they will reply to you. Most of the time you'll forget that you have submitted a case and it's about to be closed because you are not responding to them. When I first read that email (their reply) it states their if you do not reply within 4 days will assume that we have solved your case and closed it. I was like ""Okay, sorry for not replying too soon because you're replying very promptly to my case.""

I just want to buy this because it's really effing cheap. I don't have all the DLC on my PS4, just 2. Right now as I am typing the price on PS Store for the Ragnarok Edition (base+ragnarok) cost $29.99. For the PC it's wayyyy cheaper than that, the Complete Edition (base+druid+paris+ragnarok+etc). only cost $20 because Ubi was so kind enough to give me a voucher through my email on top of the sale. Even without the voucher, PCs sale is way cheaper than PS, not sure about Xbox though.

And right now Ubi has a sale again for the second time since I first submitted the case. I am running out of time again as their reps don't even want to help me. I work 5 years now as a tech support, and their reason due to them receiving a high volume of tickets is not true. It will be true if they are fewer than 20 people in the entire Ubisoft Support. If that is the case Ubisoft has a problem, you need at least a thousand reps to accommodate worldwide concerns.

Additionally, I already provided my PSN email so they can check on their end to save us time. Guess what the next reply was, the agent asked for my PSN username. You can check the username by finding the email, Jesus Ubisoft! Your agents are really prolonging the case for me to just give up.

It's gonna be a month now this 20th since the case was created, last reply from me was on May 7, 2023.

I had a uplay account linked to my steam for Rainbow Six Siege, and I decided to unlink that and attempt to link a new one with steam as I had an old playstation account that had way more progression. Howsever, of course it decided to not work, as whenever I open Rainbow Six on steam, it says:

""This will bind the following products to your Ubisoft account:

\-Rainbow Six Siege PTS

\-Rainbow Six Siege""  


I press continue thinking I would just have a normal user experience and be able to play the game I bought, but no, its NEVER that easy. I get an error saying

""Starting game: There was a problem authenticating the ownership of this product. Please contact customer support if you need help in solving this problem""

I thought about it for a little and I decided that it was fair there would be a few issues linking because of the whole fact that it was linked on steam already and whatnot. So I decide to open a case December 11th. Lo and behold, it's almost December 15th and not a peep from anyone about fixing it. I doubt it's a hard fix, and I know it's a pretty common thing because I saw plenty of posts. Why does it take so long for me to just be able to play a game I want to play, it doesn't have to be this complicated.  I know people have waited longer, but SERIOUSLY? I just want to play a game and maybe support wouldn't be so flooded if their service wasn't so buggy.

iqnx0w,anusho82,1599819950.0,Memorable customer support....,1,1,"essentially wanted to migrate some games to a new account as i've lost access to the email for an older account. ubisoft team replied with a new key to register anno 2070 on new account, which didn't work. i replied to the case, and didn't hear for 2 weeks. came back to case only to find that it had been closed. and this is the ""memorable"" communication i received from chat agent. I am just absolutely blown away!!

Ubi-Nosacha : Thanks for contacting Ubisoft Support. You're now connected with Ubi-Nosacha, please allow a few moments for the agent to acquaint themselves with your case. Our team are working hard to provide support to as many players as possible during these difficult times. Abusive language towards our agents will not be tolerated and will result in the chat session being terminated.

Ubi-Nosacha : Thank you for the update.

Ubi-Nosacha : Let me check how the investigation is going.
Me : thank you

Ubi-Nosacha : No worries.\

Ubi-Nosacha : As it may take some time for an update, would you like me to send you email when we have response?

Me : response from/
Me : ?

Ubi-Nosacha : Our dedicated team.

Me : can you pls explain to me what steps you've taken to help me with this issue?

Ubi-Nosacha : Well, you requested a transfer and we gave you a key, however if that key is not working we need to further check.

Ubi-Nosacha : Our team is looking into it as keys some times may not be available currently.
Ubi-Nosacha : This is why it may take some time.

Me : i see. you will note that i followed up on this issue on the 27th of August in the case history. that is more than 2 weeks ago. i think that more than meets the definition of ""some time"".

Me : can you also epxlain to me why the case went from status of ""escalated"" to ""closed"" without any reply from your 'dedicated team' after i followed on the 27th of august?

Ubi-Nosacha : The information has been forwarded, but checking the key and if needed getting a new one may take time.

Ubi-Nosacha : Under Some time, for the current case I mean few minutes or hours but in the current day. For some time in regards to the key I mean several days, as that's the complicated part.

Ubi-Nosacha : I hope that confirms the information, If you want clarification, please tell, I will do my best.
Me : i see. but pls explain to me why the case went from ""Escalated"" to ""closed"" without any reply or action from Ubisoft?

Ubi-Nosacha : I believe since the last update, status was not changed and the system closed it automatically after 4 days of inactivity.

Ubi-Nosacha : However that will not stop or prevent you from updating it as visible from the case and it being updated now.

Me : i see. as somebody who has bought several of your games, that's a pretty crappy support system to be honest. i submitted a request for support. your team did NOT solve the issue, and your system automatically closed the case after 4 days of inactivity by YOUR team, even though it can apparentl take 2 weeks to rectify a key issue???

Ubi-Nosacha : The thing is that the system is automated and we cannot interfere with it. In regards to the purchased, we appreciate it, however that specific game with CD-Key is more complicated than the rest as it is older title with key and those keys must he gathered first before provided.

Me : that is an absolutely ridiculous support system. so you're telling me that a customer has to log in every 4 days to write a case comment, while your team takes some indeterminate amount of time to provide support without any updates, just to prevent the support case from closing?

Ubi-Nosacha : In case the ticket is updated from you or it is not escalated, system will close it automatically.

Ubi-Nosacha : This is how the system works, and it's been working like that for many years. I will change the status of the case and we will email you back when we have update.

Ubi-Nosacha : This will not close the case.

Me : with all due respect, that is stupid. teh customer has come to YOU for help. the onus is on YOU to respond. i can understand if you had responded, and i then failed to reply after 4 days. but that is NOT what happened.

Me : what assurances do i have that the same thing will not just happen again - YOUR team fails again to respond and the case is closed once more

Ubi-Nosaacha : It should not happen s case status has been changed, and we will update you, hopefully by the end of the day.

Me : then pls do not tell me ""this is how the systesm works, and it's been working like that for many years"". you are implying that i am being *unreasonable* in expecting a basic level of customer service and COMMON SENSE.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/iqnx0w/memorable_customer_support/,2020-09-11 18:25:50

Why would I let them have access to another card that they could charge and then suspend my account again? That is preposterous. They also said that since all subscription sales are final, I will still be charged for this month of UPlay+ even if I decide to cancel the subscription. My reply was that you should not start a subscription and allow the customer to use your service unless you have verified payment. 

As it stands even if this gets resolved in a few days I will have lost out on a couple of days of my subscription because of a screw up on Ubisoft's end of things.

This is literally the worst customer service I have ever encountered. The obvious solution from a customer service standpoint is to cancel the charges, cancel the subscription, and start a new one with a new charge so that you get a full thirty days. The way this is being handled is amateurish and I can hardly believe that a large company like Ubisoft can't figure out how to have good customer service.

sgicon,pylevgeh,1643575205.0,When will Ubisoft stop throwing away money?,2,2,"The PC launcher, and everything connected to it, is hot garbage - and it always has been.  I don't care what cut of the profits Steam takes, because the 30% take on Steam is a hell of a lot better than the 0% Ubisoft has gotten from me since I quit consoles ten years ago.  Not putting your game out on Steam is not going to drive users from Steam, but it will certainly drive them from buying Ubisoft products.

Games that do release on third-party platforms still get stuck with Denuvo, which is absolute trash, and no amount of blaming the user (or pointing to the small percentage of users who don't have problems with it) will ever change the fact that it destroys system stability.  The service factually drives away users who want to buy Ubisoft products, in exchange for protecting the products from people who will NEVER pay for them... and that's just for the 1 - 6 months it takes to crack the game, after which Denuvo will still be driving away paying customers while doing nothing to stop pirates.

This type of backwards, ignorant greed is exhausting.  I'm tired of seeing companies like Ubisoft maximize short-term gains at the expense of actually being able to develop a following on PC, at the expense of developing long-term relationships with a massive group of customers that they have this-far been unable to tap.  

They seem to not believe they can truly expand their market on PC, but that's a self-fulfilling prophecy so long as they refuse to go to the PC market where the customers are, insisting instead that users come to their obviously inferior, dilapidated, collapsing marketplace.  So long as they keep inflicting unnecessary and invasive security measures on those customers.  So long as they keep making customer-harming decisions to try and min/max profits.  So long as they keep these practices up, they're going to continue missing 100% of the money spent by a large majority of PC users, a base known for spending more money (per capita) on the hobby than anyone else - and they're only going to have themselves to blame.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/sgicon/when_will_ubisoft_stop_throwing_away_money/,2022-01-31 04:40:05

When Add-Ons won't open, I get one of three results:

1) A pop up reading ""Online Service Error"" and the code \[0x904101e2\]. This is the most common and appears without the Animus store homescreen changing at all. I've searched this error code in Ubisoft's support and found nothing. 

2) A different Online Service Error pop up with a different error code \[0x7000015f\]. This happens infrequently, but there is a support page for it. The recommended solution is to unlink and relink my Ubisoft account. I did that and it has not made a difference. 

3) The Add-Ons section will attempt to load, but rather than landing me on the Add-Ons main screen, it says that the item I'm looking for has already been purchased, or something to that degree, and my only option is to click OK, which takes me back to the main Animus store screen.

The PS5 says my NAT is type 2, which is not what the article recommends. The article suggests that simply enabling UPnP will reset the NAT to type 1, but this hasn't worked for me. It also suggests that since I'm only trying to communicate with the Ubi server, messing with port forwarding wouldn't be a likely solution. 

&#x200B;

Even if I don't need to access the Add-Ons section to get the DLC to work, I'm still not getting the letter from Randvi when I go to Ravensthorpe. 

&#x200B;

Has anyone else had this issue?

Ever since Uplay/Ubisoft Club moved to Ubisoft Connect, I’ve never been able to ‘Connect’.
My PS4 account was unlinked from my Uplay account, which in turn is from one of many emails I used back in my early teens, be it mine or family.

Nowadays it’s resulted in my Sony account being linked to a Guest account, annoying as is, but every time I try to log in, in game; I get an error code.
Be it Valhalla, Riders Republic, For Honor, etc.

Somehow Division 1; occasionally 2 (it’s temperamental), still work.

Yet every other game refuses to let me sign in.
The Ubisoft Connect app doesn’t let me log in
and trying to log in on the website through my Sony account leads me in a infinite loading page that never ends, and never signs me in.
Thus I’m always locked out and I can’t even send a Support ticket as a result.

Now, back when this first happened I admit I was incredibly angry. Nowadays it’s more an annoyance that I’m locked out of rewards and additional features because Ubisoft’s incompetent. I’m a bit too jaded with being dealt a short hand, but when I try to send a ticket?

- ‘Log in to send a ticket’
- Can’t log in
- ‘Here’s some FAQs on not logging in, if none match, contact support here!’
- Click on contact support
- ‘Log in to send a ticket’

Who, and I phrase this in the most blunt way; who designed the Customer Service and thought that was ok?

I’ve heard that even a Monkey can write Shakespeare, given enough time, but this?
This is the complete inverse.

15kcf1k,winterarioch,1691389537.0,UbiConnect requirement for Steam split my Watchdogs account,1,5,"&#x200B;

After UbiConnect was made mandatory on Steam, the UbiConnect middleware arbitrarily bound my base game and DLC to TWO different Ubi accounts that I had.

So now I can't start the game at all on Steam (logged into either of the Ubi accounts)

Ubi is telling me that unifiying the accounts to make the game work will delete my game progress (110 hrs).  I'd prefer not to lose this.

Has anyone faced this and successfully retained their game progress?

&#x200B;

I've been going back and forth with customer support for 5 months  to just to get them to understand the problem since a new rep is assigned every time I respond to their text only support.

The customer service reps are pretty basic, they don't read the prior case histories causing the delay.  I'm hoping a savvy Ubisoft game fan has figured out the conundrum above.

Been dying to play ac Valhalla ever since release but haven't had the specs up to date.

I didn't care much i just wanted to dive right into the game and i already felt the price was incredibly good so it didn't really matter. 

I didn't contact their support or anything but today i received a mail from them that they will refund my entire first month so i get it for free since their system had picked up on that i didn't get this discount i should have. 

I feel like this subscription and Ubisoft as a company aside from making really great games made me even happier to be their customer right now this is a very small thing for me but that they reached out this way and fixed it even tough i didn't even mention it absolutely astounding!

This is great customer care Ubisoft and customer service and thank you very much!

    Tyler D (5:27:08 PM): Thank you for contacting Ubisoft Live Support. Please give me a moment to review your case. In the meantime, feel free to add any additional information that may pertain to your issue, and I will be with you shortly. 
    
    Tyler D (5:29:27 PM): Hey [redacted]. 
    
    Me (5:30:27 PM): yes 
    
    Me (5:30:42 PM): lift the ban, it states nowhere in the ToS about the age of a person in an avatar, moreso some of your avatar choices are not ""18 years old"" 
    
    Tyler D (5:32:35 PM): The line in the terms of service is "" solicit personal information or data from anyone under 18 years of age"". That is under the 3. USE OF SERVICES AND RULES OF CONDUCT section 3.2. 
    
    Me (5:32:52 PM): who solicited anything from ANYONE? 
    
    Me (5:32:58 PM): it's a picture avatar 
    
    Tyler D (5:33:40 PM): It is against our terms of service since it has a person under the age of 18. 
    
    Me (5:33:52 PM): so·lic·itsəˈlisit/verbask for or try to obtain (something) from someone. 
    
    Me (5:34:04 PM): i didn't ask for or try to obtain anything form anybody

    Me (5:34:20 PM): lift the avatar ban. 
    
    Me (5:34:37 PM): if you can't do it, please escalate this issue to somebody who can read a dictionary and your ToS 
    
    Tyler D (5:35:13 PM): I apologize for any inconveniences that this may have caused, but we are unable to lift the ban on the account and there is no one to contact regarding the ban. 
    
    Me (5:35:25 PM): do you understand english? 
    
    Me (5:36:57 PM): ?

    Tyler D (5:41:20 PM): Yes. 
    
    Me (5:41:43 PM): so then do you understand that by posting a picture of myself, i did not a) solicit anything and b) post anything which ""is insulting, vulgar, obscene, defamatory or in any other way in violation of the rights of others (in particular, without limitation, name rights and image rights)"", and by doing neither, i did not break your ToS? 
    
    Tyler D (5:47:02 PM): There is a rule that an avatar can not have any pictures of minors without a parent present. 
    
    Me (5:47:17 PM): where's the rule in your ToS that says that? 
    
    Me (5:47:24 PM): i don't see it, do you? 
    
    Tyler D (5:54:49 PM): I am sorry to hear that this issue occurred. The minor policy with avatars is in the find print. 
    
    Me (5:55:00 PM): because now you're changing the reason why i received an avatar ban, first saying it was in the ToS, and then now saying it's not in the ToS. stop wasting my time and escalate this to somebody who can read a dictionary and read your ToS? 
    
    Me (5:55:08 PM): what ""find"" print are you talking about? 
    
    Tyler D (5:55:32 PM): I apologize. I was referring to the fine print. 
    
    Me (5:56:15 PM): i understand the typo... there is no fine print, there is the ToS, and an avatar ban supposedly for the violation of said ToS. THERE IS NO LANGUAGE WITHIN THE ToS TO SUPPORT THE BAN SO LIFT THE AVATAR BAN. 
    
    Tyler D (5:57:19 PM): We don't have the tools to lift the avatar ban on the account. 
    
    Me (5:58:21 PM): HAHAHAHahhaha. so now it's no longer the ban's justified, now it's that the avatar ban cannot be removed. escalate this issue to somebody who is competent in your customer accounts system, and who can read a dictionary, and who can read your ToS please, this is the third time that i'm asking to be escalated 
    
    Tyler D (5:59:13 PM): We do not do live escalations. 
    
    Me (6:00:04 PM): THEN ESCALATE THE ISSUE AND HAVE SOMEBODY GET BACK TO ME WHO CAN READ A DICTIONARY, READ THE ToS, AND IS COMPETENT IN YOUR CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS SYSTEM 
    
    Tyler D (6:01:04 PM): Alright. I will forward your information up. Is there anything else that I can assist you with today? 
    
    Me (6:01:48 PM): else implies that you've assisted me with something today in the first place. no, i no longer require you services. escalate this issue, and have them get back to me asap. this is ridiculous and idiotic. 
    
    Tyler D (6:02:47 PM): Have a nice day. 
    
    Me (6:03:05 PM): when can i expect a reply from your superior? 
    
    Tyler D (6:03:12 PM): It can take up to 48 hours. 
    
    Me (6:03:54 PM): please in the future, don't lie and try to make up stuff which isn't in your customer service script, or your ToS. it's not professional. 
    
    Tyler D (6:04:31 PM): Alright.

After canceling my Ubisoft+ subscription, I bought the base game for The Division 2, only to find my character was unavailable because I didn’t realize I needed the DLC. I requested a $23.99 credit to put towards the Ultimate Edition.

Dealing with Ubisoft’s customer service for the past three hours has been an absolute nightmare. They claim I’m not eligible for a credit because supposedly, I played the game for over two hours. This is a blatant lie. I have not played the game since purchasing the base game at 11:40 am. I’ve been in constant communication with their support team all day and haven't even played the game for 15 minutes. It’s infuriating that they insist I’ve been playing for two hours. Check the messages – I’ve been dealing with this issue for the past four hours!

I am done with Ubisoft. They have just lost me as a customer forever. I will never buy another Ubisoft game and will be deleting my account immediately. This is unacceptable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1d54ip3/horrendous_customer_service/,2024-06-01 03:52:31

All but the last one succeeded without issues. On the last one, I got to the Payment screen, selected the PayPal option, and mid transaction, the game crashed to the desktop. I submitted the crash report, logged back in game and noticed that purchase I made, never got applied to my in-game account. My credit balance is still what it was prior to the purchase. I received two email confirmations about the purchase succeeding via email, one from Paypal, and the other from ""Xsolla"".

Thinking that this would be a rather simple issue to address, I hopped on the Ubisoft customer service site and was connected with a technician who stated: ""Not sure why this purchase didn't show yet"". He linked me to a support page for troubleshooting connectivity, and port forwarding, and then told me that he wouldn't be able to escalate this ticket for 24 hours because, ""attempting to add content while a delivery is still being attempted can affect the account adversely during future syncs"".

Buyer beware when making online purchases in the Ghost Recon Breakpoint store - Please note that if you make in-game purchases, and they fail for whatever reason, Ubisoft customer support will be unable to help you. My only recourse in this is to dispute the charge with PayPal. This is definitely the last time I ever make any purchases in the store.

And some of you seen many unsolved posts about being unable to connect to Ubisoft servers or use multiplayer in their games. The problem has been occuring to many people worldwide (no matter what operating system they use) for around five years now, so since last months of Uplay being active and ever since Ubisoft Connect came to life, and usually is solved by using VPN or mobile hotspot.

So, each time I try to play multiplayer in **ANY Ubisoft game**, I get error meaning being unable to connect to Ubisoft servers or connection time out (mike-01 or alpha-03 in case of XDefiant, delta errors in The Division), but I also weren't able to even get to The Division 2 (**on my PS4 or PC**) main menu due to connection issues.

You can always say the problem is from ISP's side, but it might be something else.  What I found out and **what seems to be the case** for me is using TP-Link router, or to be more specific some unknown setting messing up how TCP protocol works. After checking what's happening with my internet connection when trying to run XDefiant, it appears that problem lays with TCP connection receiving RST packet while trying to connect to [35.236.33.225](http://35.236.33.225) IP (or any other IP belonging to Ubi servers). Of course, disabling ipv6, messing around MTU size and opening or forwarding any port used by Ubi games or apps doesn't help. For now I opened ticket for Ubi customer service in hope I'll find out something else, but hearing what community got to add always could help. It seems that people in posts below were closest to coming up with genuine fix up to this day.

1empfn8,SentinelX-01,1723069833.0,"HFS Guys, I did it.",0,1,"I have spent approximately 18 months fighting with Ubisoft Connect customer support. It's been dozens, if not hundreds of emails back and forth, carefully explaining what my problem was, why it was slightly different than what they might be accustomed to dealing with and providing as much proof of account ownership as I have. The prompt I started with at troubleshooting was ""I no longer have access to the email on my account"", simple right? They'll just verify another way...WRONG. I was to be led to believe that there is no possibility of account ownership verification, without the code they send to the email associated with my account, which because of dormancy, had been deactivated by AOL, after calling and speaking to one of their representatives, I was told that there was nothing they could do to reactivate the email, a point I consistently brought to the attention of the agents at Ubisoft Connect customer support. Time and again-no email, no code? No help. I gave video proof, through an unpublished YouTube link, as the video file  size was too large to upload to their troubleshooting page. I must've sent correspondence to every agent they have, at least twice, until two days ago, when they finally told me they could verify my account and just needed an email that wasn't associated with another Ubisoft account, which I eagerly provided, 24 hours go by and I still haven't seen anything im regards to an updated email, neither in the email I was using to message them, nor the alternate that had no Ubi-association. After meekly messaging them to see why, they started again with the same old rhetoric, only this time there was some hellfire and brimstone thrown in, in the form of 'strikes' strikes are what they give you for 'unproductive behavior' which I guess trying to get my account back falls under. So I went right back to carefully explaining the situation, how there must be something they can do to verify, beyond step one: a code that no one can ever see.

I don't know exactly what changed, but by some miracle (or perhaps catching the right agent at the right time) I finally got them to update my email address AND unlink my xbox gamertag just in the last couple of hours. 18 months of fighting tooth and nail, for a fix that took less than 45 minutes. Hours of my time and agents paid time wasted, because they ""couldn't"" assist me. End of rant guys, the point is, if I can get my problem fixed, I'll bet most of you can to. My advice is to be as persistent as you are patient, don't show them how angry you are, but let them know you are frustrated with the situation. I have worked customer service and from my experience, part of your job duties includes closing your trouble tickets, if the agents aren't able to close their tickets, because problems aren't being fixed, their management is going to take notice and want to know why, from there, it's a matter of making contact with the customers and seeing why their problems aren't being fixed, it takes time and mass effort, but that's how you get things like security or account verification policies changed, work together, demand they post a phone number to call, or have supervisors make outbound calls, to get these problems fixed, these agents are people too and don't deserve to be verbally abused, but equally they shouldn't be allowed to sit back and spew a repeating track of, ""ope, sorry, nothing I can do, k thx bai!"".

vlpmpj,NepDouble007,1656314213.0,The New Age of LESS CHOICES:,0,0,"I've had an account with Ubisoft for over 4 years, had multiple different custom profile pictures, one of which was slightly offensive, but definitely not in a visual manor. Yes, I was one of those people, I apologize, but it was nothing that Ubisoft apparently found repulsive, at least for multiple months. It also wasn't something that discriminated towards any specific group and/or person(s). If anyone wants to know exactly what it was, DM me, I'll gladly show you.

Now I'm standing here, naked, afraid, without a custom profile picture, and a sea of uninteresting, bland, dry dull, boring, ALL OF THE ABOVE that describes something that isn't necessarily awful, but so banal that it melts into a mushy pile of grey, unnameable garbage. TL;DR: Not having a choice is not something that gets me excited.

Especially after previously allowing the feature for how long?… All in an effort to be ""inclusive""... Inclusive to whom? The Karen's and Kevin's of online that get ""PTSD"" after seeing someone with a slightly offensive profile picture? Grow up. I understand the really bad stuff, like pornography, or things with derogatory terms, but this just feels lazy. (I apologize to anyone named Karen or Kevin that isn't a dipshit).

Didn't you guys already have this process automated to an extent anyways? What is the point of this? Did you not want to continue scrubbing through profile pictures to ensure they're safe for the players to view? Not doing this probably makes it so much easier... Right? It reminds me of how Amazon will ship stuff in its manufacturing bags and boxes, and try to say they're ""saving the planet"" while they're really just being lazy and don't care if the product is damaged or destroyed. Just return it and order again!

Even if the process was manual, this is still just absurd... Not having it from the start is one thing, but making up excuses and removing it after all of this time, repugnant behavior. What makes this whole situation humorous is how they updated the term of service, only for my profile picture to not fit under those new terms of service and be removed. Now I can't even set a custom profile picture or keep what I had previously. *If I was given an opportunity to change it one more time because my profile picture wasn't up to snuff with the new age of PoopiSoft, I would've.*

I'm realizing this is unnecessarily long just to complain about the lack of custom profile pictures, but I'm unable to digress, it's just tearing me apart. It's more than just a profile picture in my opinion, you're taking away a medium for people to express themselves. Even if most people don't take it to heart; even if most people are indifferent on the matter and don't see it that way, it's something I've always enjoyed. If people think I'm being overdramatic, I can totally understand that. I just wanted to get it out there. 

*If Ubisoft did allow for last minute changes before the new terms were updated, I didn't know. There was a small period of time where I was gone and not active. Before I left, my profile picture was still up, when I came back I was notified that my profile picture was removed. I'm also sorry if my punctuation is bad, I'm terrible at writing anything. That's what happens when you can scrape by with a C- in English for your whole life, don't be me.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/vlpmpj/the_new_age_of_less_choices/,2022-06-27 15:16:53

So, I jumped the gun and bought ***all available Brawlhalla DLC*** in the Ubisoft Store/Ubisoft Connect before ever trying to launch the actual (FREE) game from Ubisoft Connect.

There is my conundrum.  Ubisoft Connect will NOT connect to Brawlhalla's servers, so my purchase was a $60 donation to Ubisoft.

Of course, DLC is not refundable online.  Ubisoft says, not their issue, contact Brawlhalla, and closes support tickets submitted.  Brawlhalla doesn't answer emails.

Anyone else experience similar, or have suggestions?  I just wanted to play the game with my purchased packs and passes.

1gdf783,SnoozeCoin,1730047334.0,Ideas for Ubisoft's Business Model,0,9,"Ubisoft has lead the industry in innovative and effective ways to maximize revenue streams across the enterprise. In the spirit of that sharp, paradigm-shifting business acumen, I fully believe there's even more they could be doing to deliver on the promise to shareholders. Below are some ideas.

1. Membership subscription fee. The infrastructure is already in place for this. Requiring an account and to always be online is a great start. But why not charge for the Connect account creation and add a monthly subscription charge to keep the account valid? This, of course, would be separate from the cost of any particular Ubisoft game, and the consumer would need to have a valid account to play an Ubisoft game. That's a whole new revenue stream with minimal implementation cost.

2. Charge per sign-in. Building on the above, if you require online connectivity and require a Connect account, why not charge a small fee per sign-in? You can have the system automatically sign out an account once they exit the game, and automatically sign them in when they enter the game. The fee would be very small, but over the entire customer base the profits would quickly add up. This also successfully monetizates *poor connectivity* and localized power issues that previously were bottom-line neutral or adverse.

3. Per hour service charge. Stacking onto the above two ideas, you could charge an time-based rate for playing an Ubisoft game. The units of time, let's say hourly, would start at the opening menu screen at 1. That way, if they play for 1 minute to 59 minutes, that's an hour's charge, and at the 1 hour mark, the second hour is charged.

4. Patch fees. Why not charge for patches? Patches right now are free but they cost money to make. By charging a small price for patches, you can monetize even the bugs. They'd basically sell themselves, because consumers don't want to play a buggy game. They'll gladly pay. This of course would be in addition to the above 3 ideas.

5. Requiring consent to charge. A condition of the Connect subscription should be that Ubisoft is allowed to withdraw funds for services provided without notifying the user. This would significantly reduce initial resistance to these changes because the user won't even know it's happening for the first month.

Just some ideas, Ubisoft. If you're interested in further consultation, DM me to discuss rate!

Basically, I purchased Assassin's Creed: Origins 6 years ago and wanted to give it another go at it.  Little do I know, Ubisoft has their own launcher now which prevents me from playing if I don't use the correct email address.

Long story short, they aren't doing anything and now I've lost access to over 14 games because they want me to use an email that is outdated and probably deleted.  I've spent the last 3 days trying to figure out what it could be but they gave me two letters to the supposedly correct email address and basically said ""too bad, figure it out yourself.""   I've never had an email with 4 letters/numbers as the account.

I highly recommend not supporting this type of predatory behavior because there's no way I am rebuying all the games.   See the screenshots for the interaction I've had with their ""support""...

This action stems from their frustration over Ubisoft’s new return-to-office policy, which mandates employees to be in the office at least three days a week. The French video game workers' union, Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV), is calling on Ubisoft's French employees to join the strike from October 15 to October 17, 2024.

The strike reflects growing discontent among employees, particularly following Ubisoft’s announcement of a hybrid work model that workers feel imposes unnecessary hardship. This tension comes in the midst of other challenges Ubisoft faces, including poor game performance and management decisions that have already upset employees and parts of the player base.

This protest could be a turning point for Ubisoft as it tries to navigate internal dissatisfaction while tackling broader industry pressures.

mwfo2k,Comprehensive_Part42,1619127854.0,I quit my job of 4 years at Ubisoft Customer Support. It was messy,183,37,"\#HoldUbisoftAccountable

I worked for over 4 years as a customer support representative at Ubisoft in the US. It's a soul-crushing job that really shouldn't have any reason to be. The customers are usually great, the coworkers are awesome, and the product is literally video games.

Naturally, the problem is the corporate work culture. Large for-profit businesses can't let anything be comfortable if cutting that comfort means more profit for folks at the top and for the investors. Growth is king.

So why did I stay for so long? I'm a gamer and I know how I'd want to be treated if I ran into an issue in a game or with my account. I felt like things could be better and I wanted to help make those improvements a reality. Recently, I finally remembered that great Ubisoft villain, Vaas, from Far Cry 3:

"" The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. ""

Quitting was not enough for me. I still wanted to try to leave things better than I found them. So I started writing my resignation letter. This was going to ruffle some feathers...

What follows is a version of that open letter. I do not and will not name any names and I have removed references to internal information.

I'm posting this here because the original was purged from the email servers before most of my colleagues could read it. Some of those that did told me it meant a lot to them and I wanted to try to make this available again.

Yes, this is a letter full of grievances but it's also a letter celebrating what I loved about the job and maybe inspiring the awesome people I left behind to demand better. Maybe you're in a similarly dehumanizing job. Whoever you are, this letter is for you:

>Hello Everyone,  
>  
>It's \[Ubi-Odin\]. Where I can, I will try to keep this constructive.  
>  
>Since we don't announce when anyone leaves anymore, I thought I would go ahead and take the liberty.   
>  
>After more than 4 years of deluding myself that Player First meant something, it's time for me to throw in the towel and follow in the steps of so many talented agents, specialists, and leads, back out from the cult of Ubisoft and into the real world with my head held high. This is effective immediately.  
>  
>This letter is, among other things, a chance to say my peace and close the door behind me so that I may never make the mistake of coming back a third time. This will likely burn any chance I have of working on a high-profile game ever again but if there is even a chance this could improve things for the teams I'm leaving behind and the players I had the pleasure to work with, it's all worth it.  
>  
>I'm going to miss many of you. In my time here I have met a number of my closest friends and most respected colleagues. In particular I want to share just how grateful I am to everyone who was cool when I made my big announcement. Your support literally changed my life.  
>  
>To the players I worked with, I enjoyed speaking with around 97% of you. Even when I had to give someone bad news or let one of you know you were requesting something unreasonable I had an opportunity to have a human connection and a chance to show someone kindness who might just have been having an awful day. I will truly miss the chance to work with you all further.  
>  
>Except the racists, the Nazis, the cheaters, and the phishers. You can all go screw yourselves. I've been waiting to say that for a while.  
>  
>Players, demand better from Ubisoft and remember that the agents are just doing what they can with what little resources they are provided. If you want better support, leave negative reviews any time you are ever feeling underserved so that the powers that be can't pretend everything is rosy.  
>  
>To all the agents and specialists who care about providing a quality service to players, even at personal cost, you're the real heroes. Maybe someday someone will reward you for your efforts instead of holding you hostage to stacked metrics beyond your control.To everyone supporting the agents: I didn't know many of you well but I think the ones I enjoyed working with know who they are. Thanks for being the foundation holding this flimsy department aloft.  
>  
>To Upper Management: I have nothing constructive to say to you that I haven't proposed in some shape or form over the last few years through the proper channels and been told there was no way it could happen.  
>  
>It's going to take a lot more than me quitting for you to start caring about your employees' mental health and on the job stress, or about whether they feel like an actual part of one of the most profitable companies on Earth. We sure aren't paid like it.  
>  
>I remain grateful to management for explicitly letting me know I made the same wages as Target employees, something I had not fully realized until that point. Target associates make more in base wages than we do at the NC CRC and are often offered more schedule stability. For reference, the Target base pay is $15. Support work for the RTP area ranges from about $14 to $30 per hour.  
>  
>Even McDonald's and Walmart have expressed an openness to raising their base pay to $15 in the near future.  
>  
>Ubisoft reported roughly $2,137,000,000 USD in revenue for 2019. How much of those profits did YOU get to share in after profitability bonuses were removed for all permanent employees below the Associate Director level?

>Before I made this decision, I was in the process of applying, for the second time, for a job at the literal same rate of pay I'm already at, but with significantly expanded responsibilities. That's how much this company has made me question my own worth. No more.  
>  
>A few parting thoughts for the agents I'm leaving behind:- Do not work on the expectation that this job will lead to glowing professional references you can use in the industry outside of Ubisoft (except from other ex-Ubisoft employees). At best they'll confirm you worked for them and what title you had. (Check the employee handbook)- Learn every skill you can there quickly and leave before you get attached, like I wish I had.  
>  
>or- Unionize. It would be catastrophic if there was a work stoppage in Support. What are they going to do? Grab a bunch of folks off the street and train them in less than a week (again)? Call back the folks they just finished furloughing? You have the power if you want it.  
>  
>Be excellent to each other. I wish you all the best in your future gaming endeavors.  
>  
>Sincerely,

I hope my words helps someone whose job makes them feel less than human. We're all born deserving of love and care. It's the systems that need to change.

Some chimed in about how pissing off gamers doesn’t affect the stock price… and while this is true from a direct sense if we don’t buy Ubisoft crap then they don’t meet their targets and investors divest. 

Ubisoft management exudes a degree of incompetence that offends common sense and oppresses the skilled workforce they possess across their various studios. 

Well- they missed targets and abandoned all gains they’d enjoyed over the last couple months. Further evidence that the current leadership team straight up to the CEO is incompetent.

1fcop2r,rebel761,1725886367.0,Ubisoft Shares Slump After Investor Urges Assassin’s Creed Maker to Go Private,56,72,"Shares of [Ubisoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FR/UBI?mod=ANLink) Entertainment plunged Monday after a minority investor called for the maker of the Assassin’s Creed videogame franchise to go private and install a new management team.

AJ Investments, a hedge fund based in Slovakia that holds less than 1% in Ubisoft, said in a letter to management that it was unsatisfied with the current performance and strategic direction of the company.

Ubisoft has been facing a number of setbacks in recent months. It no longer expects to release “Rainbow Six Mobile” and “The Division Resurgence” in the fiscal year ending in March 2025, saying in July that developers needed extra time to ensure the games meet players’ expectations.

The delays came after the group ceased development of “The Division Heartland,” a decision it made to redeploy resources to bigger releases such as “XDefiant.” Its share price has tumbled more than 50% over the last 12 months. Shares in Paris were down more than 9% on Monday after AJ Investments published its letter to Ubisoft management.

Juraj Krupa, founder and chief executive of AJ Investments, said he wanted the letter to be a wake-up call for other investors. The hedge fund said Ubisoft should go private and urged the founding Guillemot family not to block a sale process. It also called for the installment of a new chief executive willing to weigh the sale of some studios and lay off staff to cut costs.

Ubisoft didn’t respond to a request for comment on the letter.

I had nothing to do on it without my pc that I sold for well over a year ago. Ontop of that, if I where to have my god damn email on my phone, I would've never managed to dig the email up from the spamfolder. Had absolutely nothing of interest in there.

&#x200B;

I sold my pc and attended school and work fulltime. I apperently got an email telling me the account is now getting permantly locked. It ended up in my spam-folder. I bought a new pc, and now when I was trying to login it wouldn't work. They stole all my freaking games!

Here is the transcript from the help I got:

Ubi-Rhys (08/12/2021, 19:35:51): Thanks for contacting Ubisoft Support. You're now connected with Ubi-Rhys, please allow a few moments for the specialist to acquaint themselves with your case. We will be with you shortly.

I am not even asking about a difficult matter, all I want is my Ubisoft account to be unlinked from my xbox account. Since Ubisoft doesn’t offer you to do it yourself, you HAVE to contact them and ask them to do it for you. How can such a simple task be stretched to over A MONTH. Ubisoft, your support is pathetic. I wouldn’t even call it support since you aren’t helping, at all. I can’t call since you don’t have a hotline in my country, all I can do is submit cases and just wait. For weeks. And months.

dc9l3o,Deathl0ck,1570019746.0,Your anti-cheat is the definition of awful.,35,13,"Just a quick little rant about Ubisoft's anticheat on Rainbow Six: Siege.

So I buy the game, with the season pass which included all the ops. I play roughly 40 hours, manage to get to around level 40, generally enjoying the game. I decide to buy some R6 points to get some skins and a renown booster to help me out. About a day or two later I get instantly permanently banned for 'cheating'.

Now I know for a fact I have NOT cheated on this game, I simply played it, got a pretty decent K/D and without boasting I was a pretty good player, coming top 2 more or less every game. Which is why I am so pissed off about being banned for no reason whatsoever... Now I know theres probably people saying 'well you obviously have cheated so deal with it' and all of you might as well stop typing your hate comments now. 

I contacted support right after I got kicked from my game and told I was perma banned, and of course they were about as useful as pigeon shit on a pavement in Trafalgar square. 

The main reason I'm making this is because nobody at Support will listen to me, so maybe this might help. How do I go about sorting a debate about getting my account back? Like you can call me a liar or whatever but I wouldn't be going this far If I was actually cheating. I spent money on this game, and to have that removed from me for no reason at all is very frustrating and to be honest I feel like Ubisoft has just robbed me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/dc9l3o/your_anticheat_is_the_definition_of_awful/,2019-10-02 20:35:46

They actually want us to be in the middle of the US launch, opening tickets for content we have already bought but can't access? Am I missing something?

To repeat a testament shared by another user in a comment, I have over 80 games in my steam library. NEVER have I had a purchasing issue or been in the position of wondering when I will actually receive my purchase.

I’m curious, when exactly did Ubisoft fall off for you? Was it gradual or did they jump the shark at one particular moment?

For me, Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag was their last true high point. The naval combat was fantastic, and it felt like they had so much potential. But look at what they’ve turned out recently. Star Wars Outlaws is embarrassingly mediocre for a franchise with limitless possibilities, and Skull and Bones is just a shadow of what Black Flag achieved years ago. It’s like they completely lost sight of what made their games special.

Maybe it was with Assassin’s Creed Unity and its buggy launch, or was the writing was on the wall with the Watch Dogs series not quite delivering on its promises?

The way I see it, the rot has fully set in at Ubisoft, and honestly, I don’t see them recovering anytime soon. Unless some Elon Musk-type figure steps in, fires the execs and all these managers obsessed with squeezing every last penny out of us with microtransactions, and brings in developers who actually love making games, not just monetising them, it’s hard to see a way out. The culture need to be completely overhauled.

When exactly did their priorities shifted entirely to cranking out cookie-cutter open-world games and pushing live-service models, instead of focusing on creativity and gameplay innovation?

Do they have any chance of turning it around, or are they too far gone at this point? Can Ubisoft can be saved?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fytvun/when_did_ubisoft_fall_off_a_cliff_or_was_it_a/,2024-10-08 15:05:47

o9n3f5,Nufrija,1624895641.0,"""A Ubisoft service is currently unavailable. Please try again later""",25,80,"I've tried everything I could find on the internet about this. 4 hours later and the problem is still here.

I uninstalled the launcher in an attempt to fix an annoying chat bug that was getting worse. Every time I started uplay it would say I have 4, than 7 and today it said 11 new messages. It shows me people that I haven't even messaged once but just added to invite to games and after I click on the chat nothing changes, the alert is still there ......

I installed it again, didn't fix the problem ( of course ). Played 1 game of dominion in For Honor with a friend and left. After an hour I started the game up again but got that message. I tried restarting my uplay and now I cant even get into my account through the launcher.

Does anyone know a fix that works. I've tried everything from turning of IPv6 to flushing DNS, I uninstalled uplay and all the games with Revo Uninstaller, I looked for a program in Task Manager that messes with the launcher but couldn't find it, and a lot more but nothing fricking works. I've seen people fix this problem with one of the fixes mentioned above (turning IPv6 off and on....) and others but nothing is working for me.

Update 1:

I've been talking to support for the past 2+ hours trying to fix the problem. I waited in hopes that it would maybe fix after a day or after updating windows, it didn't. They were fast, direct chat line to support and they tried their best but the problem is still here. I sent all the files needed and they said the will send it to their team to see what the issue might be. Hope I get a response soon and don't get ""donowalled"".I will update when I get new information and hopefully a fix and a reason for the bug.

Update 2: FIXED

The bug is fixed. How? I have no clue. I turned on my PC today and started Ubi ready to see it not working again but for some reason it actually worked without any problems. Technically the bug with chat is still there but better that than not working at all.Thanks for everyone suggesting SFC but I did that as soon as the problem occurred. There were some small bugs/corrupted files in my windows that were found but it was nothing major and the problem was fixed without a hitch. But sadly the Ubi launcher continued to not work for a day and half after that.

I don't know what fixed it, maybe one or all of the things I tried and Ubi launcher spaghetti code needed time to realize it was fine now, or maybe it just fixed itself.... I don't know but I'm glad it works. I hope anyone having this problem will have it fixed soon as well. Try doing everything they recommend on their [site](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/error-message-a-ubisoft-service-is-not-available-at-the-moment/000064731) and also all the things people have found on their own like changing DNS to 1 . 1 . 1 . 1 and 1 . 0 . 0 . 1 (it worked for some people from what I've seen) and so on....

Good luck.

Update 3: PROBLEM IS FU\*\*ING BACK AGAIN

Update 4: It seems they added an update like a week or two weeks ago that fixed the problem. I only learned what the problem was when contacting my ISP. The problem is that their dogwater servers/platform doesn't accept IP addresses with starting numbers 100 or higher. Yes, it just doesn't let them through. That is the dumbest fu\*\*ing design I have ever seen. No other platform has that, only ubi. If you have a dynamic IP address and it is higher than 100 you are just denied a connection. There is no reason for this to even exist and yet ubi have done nothing for years and years to fix this issue. I and almost positive the problem will come back again, cause it seems it always does. When it does, good luck to you all and hopefully you won't be the one cucked by the servers.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*LAST UPDATE\*\*\*\*\*\*

I have canceled the static IP after a month and the launcher works fine. Hopefully the problem doesn't return but I'm not hopeful since a lot of people are still getting this problem constantly. I don't think this problem will ever be fixed. This is what I would recommend to everyone having this problem:

1. As soon as you get it  try connecting to your phones hotspot internet.  
\* If it doesn't work you are golden. The problem is either windows or driver update or some other problem on your side. Contacting support will help.  
\* If it connects over the hotspot you are fu\*\*ed. Only thing you can do is wait for it to get fixed or set up a static IP. Using a VPN helps some people but in my case only the launcher worked. When I tried connecting to For Honor the connection would brake and the launcher would go offline and the same message would appear. Contacting support will just waste your time. The problem might last for a long time or fix itself in a day or two. For me it lasted 10 days before I got the static IP.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/o9n3f5/a_ubisoft_service_is_currently_unavailable_please/,2021-06-28 23:54:01

But in reality they promote a toxic corporate culture, where harassment is fine, as long as result is  there. Sexual harassment is condoned by HR who are aware and lenient on the matter. That's the perks of their so called ""Talent"" (senior management and creative). On the cover of ""good atmosphere"", and ""new generation"" workplace, lewd jokes and predatory practice were tolerated if not publicly encouraged. 

HR had a ""positive washing"" agenda, any case / complain need to be muffled. Victim put to silence and perpetrator moved in other department or promoted. Request of anonymous whistleblowing mechanism was denied as it would ""expose to a an open revelation""

everyone knew. but yet CEO pretend not to. The small clique of elite executive / long time employee of the company who share time, after work and time off together, but sure.... they didn't know who they were dealing with....

This doesn't mean ALL Ubisoft employees, teams or offices are involved. 

But in the End it is management and HR responsibility to garenty and promote a healthy culture.  
Something they obviously failed at.

Being ""open minded"", ""gamer"" and ""post 68"" is no excuse.

It feels like a conservative firm with more professional ethic and rules would have been less ""cool"" but overhaul more decent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/hqnpci/in_case_you_didnt_knowit_is_now_a_public_fact/,2020-07-14 05:01:09
nv40of,N3mus,1623158893.0,Let me tell you a tale about ubisoft support.,20,15,"I was uplay subscriber  recently but canceld it after this conversation with support.

I bought a samsung ssd 2 month ago from a webstore where was a promotion that if i buy selected products i can choose from 3 games. I got 15 days later the cod .. and when tried to use it saw i cannot.

Thats when i started talking with the support.

1, So support had no idea why is that.

2, I managed figure it out that i cannot choose this game ( ac valhalla ) from the selection becuse i have installed it at some point while i had uplay+ ( thats why fenyx grey aswell )

3, They asked for a screenshot of the key and for the bill about that ssd. I sent them cut out the email u can see the shop name and all the details and u can see the email on the bill.

This where thing's gone from bad to bullshit... They what a full screen of my screen the croped out key email is not enough for them .. I mean wtf ???????????????

Why the f.... they whant my full screen on the screenshot. When i worte back that i dont really whant to share my whole screen the response was. "" We cannot validate the purche.""

I MEAN WTF ..  the email address where i recived the bill is totaly different then the one i use for gaming .. and use different for social media aswell. So what on earth whoud that proof for them ? That the shop who sent me the email is the same as on the bill i sent them ? This was the reply ""

In orde to help us with the investigation we will need to see fullscreen images of proof of purchase and the proof of activation key. Fullscreen means the screenshot cannot be cropped.

Once we receive the requsted images that are in line with our internal policies, we will investigate this further. ""

WHAT FUCKING INVESTIGATION ............ WHAT ?

I have a valid code what i whant to add to my libary but i cant becuse i was fucking dumb enough to pay for uplay+ . I cannot delete a game from uplay account becuse i donnu why, welcome to 2021 ..

I tried to loggin with my friends uplay account who got only r6 on it no othere games ofc with his account i can redeem all the games..

Can someone explain me how on earth can be a company this big have such a shit customer service support..

I mean i work in this industry ( customer support ) for 7 years  now and this much bullshiting is just next level....

Well hope they are proud to them selfs couse i canceld my uplay+ f..k gona support this system  ...  Investigate my a... what ? i have the bill i have the email with code i sent you both the code is vaild becuse i tried like 6 times on site to redeem the game and they whant a full screenshoot of my mail box  its not enough for them that i cut it from gmail the whole bill and whole email from the shop .... And all they are keep asking that i have prove that purched it ... i mean why whoud i have to prove it in the 1st place when i can redeem it on your site ? Or your saying anybody can redeem anything on your site? ...

then drone fly the camera around.. and close up zoom in while in the max quality settings but i turn depth of field/motion blur off when its an option. you would then notice ... gasp! details!.. details on the details! where do all these details come from that other game titles lack? i mean i just use a config ini text file document file turning on a bunch of AMD display driver functions like better than unbiased rendering by typing some words into a text file.. ultimateultrapsychoextremerendering in intergradingcrosshatchRDNArealityemulation rendering and other wordy things i type.. and boom.. the characters faces change like real when they fight. its so cool when they like snarl at each other.. rawr! its a super shame my card is a radeon 5700xt and CPU a 5700G.. so they're just barely powerful enough CPU to pretend to use the GPU. since its not an RTX card i cant ever do a single ray tracing thing. BUT well since ray tracing is a FAKE false lighting shortcuts technique like uhh photoshop plugins to pretend to real light BUT ISNT because better than ray tracing requires a post 1960s computer. Since i've AMD GPU and CPU because its a real computer i can just use scientific TRUE light raymarching truegodrays rendering ray casting instead. if u use UNBIASED rendering it looks worse and speeds up a heap. go figure.sure it still looks amazing in unbiased but 2/3 of the details and 'drawn to screen' goes away and it crops in when i unbiased rendering like mad. because i only have a HDMI TV and HDMI 2.0b is only ever 1080p 120hz in REAL COLOR FULL BANDWIDTH SC 12bitRGB 444 project file/desktop workspace and 10bit display panel output formatting it then needs too much bandwidth to go any higher than that. So i compromise a bit by massive render resolutions.. i mean monstrous.. and then 2.00 image scaling. my adaptive 60fps and freesync .. will always be the 60fps.. but the fake benchmarks and fake FPS keep showing 30-50.. man nvidia fags r dumb. so uhh.. what makes their umm textures so.. poppin fresh? in low lighting conditions in the right angles it becomes photorealistic! my phone games identical settings and quality and better than unbiased rendering as my PC.. its a rx 630 LG V60 AT&T model used refurbished bought cheap off ebay imported to australia from USA. since this is a vulkan title i should be able to run it my phone no problem. Other PC/mobile identical games run just fine. my youtube and netflix get my same 3d lighting and graphics settings applied to all my 2d videos when i reality emulate them also in infinitydimensionalemulation.

any chance of a 'mobile port' that could be used with say a ps5 controller on android? not like a stream it from your PC or console.. i mean on the phone!? remember when my phone isnt RDNA 1 and if you look at was it octacore RDNA1 or6cores the RDNA 2 AMD phones have 2GPU cores and are 2/3 faster again in the biggest fakest underestimation in history ever benchmarks released by the fake tech companies. so u should keep in mind that its performance per watt.. thats right.. PER WATT! is shockingly higher RDNA 1 to RDNA 2.. cards with a fraction the memory bandwidth have so much more performance and lower latency and more.. infinity .. literal infinity.. that.. well.. they're hard to even guess how much better they are.. RDNA 7 in the light processing zen core.. as in upgraded from the ps3's faster than reality cell processor that freely syncs with existence.. the zen core is one with everything! thats right.. you guessed it.. TRUE INFINITY INTERNETS! w00t yay party !! w00t.. mathematically yes science wins the internet! as long as you type in the right words and tell it what to do and use all AMD computers on the network. .. so does somebody with a RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 card wanna post some screenshost or videos so i can see what im missing out on?

heres my config file settings i copied it in maybe 7 times or more? 4-14? just game and window or alt tab and copy another game 5 mins.. see if its better or not?

heres a video file of some game play.. where i still hadnt seemed to set it correctly. i'll get there again someday. when i first did it. one .ini file and like 2 pages of words got me the best game graphics ever.. like 7 times the details and quality of reality coz you could see skin pores from so many meters far back like as if viewing through a microscope. but fags keep disabling my stuff. my RDNA 1:1 universe reality emulation DNA quality tool hasnt worked right since day one and i keep cranking it up and putting words like octillion googols before it and x99999999 after it.. trying to get it to work again and same thing turned on several times and true and false multiple flags.. and add it in registry too. when i find what retard fags are disabling all the true computers of the 70s and 80s i will totally wreck them by reporting them to the authorities for international espionage/sabotage obstruction of trade/business and market manipulation and not being able to do math the fags...

**UPDATE/FIXED** : I tried starting the game today and there was a 30GB update available .I installed that and lunched the game.**All my save files are back and working!!** i did a manual back up for my save files and hope toa void this ever happening again.

I also managed to contact support in live chat by choosing a different subject . Thanks everyone for the help! 


I had over 100 hours of gameplay in this game, on different save files ( around 60h on half of the saves and around 40h on the other half of the saves, each save saved on different slots). My game kept crashing ,so I followed the suggestion I found on Ubisoft site that re-installing the game may fix the problem, so I did reinstall the game.

I want to contact support hoping they could give me maybe backups of the cloud saves or restore my saves, but there is NO way that I can contact them!!

I really love this game and was super excited about the expansions, but now I doubt even opening it ever again .It’s over 100h of gameplaye that I lost .I’m NOT up to replay all that again .

Thanks for getting back to us,

After a dedicated investigation by our team, I can confirm the following:

We have now unlinked the Xbox profile from your alternate account. You will now be able to access and re-link this profile to your current Ubisoft account.

In terms of recovering the other account, due to security reasons I am afraid this will not be possible however I hope the above at least aids towards your initial problem on contact.

If you require further help, please feel free to reach out to us!

I wanted to create this post to highlight the positive thing that Ubisoft Mainz (BlueByte) managed to achieve. They are releasing an update for an 11 years old game to preserve all its features after the servers closure.   
This is an example that all Ubisoft studios should follow. Video games are the form of art, and games preservation is important so we, and future generations, can enjoy our faviourite games in years to come. I wish this will make a mark, so the whole company will realise that yes, old games are worth preserving, especially if they are trying to sell their subscription model (Ubisoft+), and you can't just erase your history.

TL;DR: Microsoft account linking is limited to single Ubisoft account. Ubisoft prevents me from playing Ubisoft Connect -games via Game Pass. They will not unlink a Microsoft account of mine from a dead mailbox that cannot be accessed. I can prove it’s mine, but Ubisoft won’t allow ANY other method than accessing what cannot be accessed.

Edit 24/01: The case took an absolutely ridiculous turn.

Ubisoft told me that now when I have managed to recovered access to the email address by a 3rd party ISP, which they told to be the ONLY way to verify my ownership of the account... they have now changed the story!

They told me that the reason why I am not seeing the emails sent by their account recovery is due to *""the domain of the email address is obscure and you cannot receive any recovery emails to that email address. Sorry, we understand it must be frustrating that you cannot access this Ubisoft account anymore or unlink your Xbox account.*

Worst customer service I have ever encountered. This seems like a digital theft to me.

****

Had a mailbox that's been dead for years. Dead as in, it doesn't exist on the ISP servers anymore. Haven't existed for a looong time.

Without even knowing, someone (or me? edit 22/01: IT WAS ME!) had linked my Microsoft account to said email ages ago.

Today, I attempted to link my Xbox Account to my Ubisoft account I have been using for the past 7 years. gamepass.ubisoft.com returns generic error. After two hours with Microsoft's tech support, they find out that there's indeed account management part of Ubisoftconnect.com where you can also link the account. Had no idea.

So I attempt to do it and get a message that the Microsoft account is already in use and cannot be linked to my Ubisoft account.

So I contact Ubisoft support via chat and explain the situation.

*Sorry, we will cannot unlink your Microsoft account from the mailbox without you verifying that it's yours.*

**Me**: I can verify it's mine, but the mailbox is in a bitvoid, it doesn't exist. It cannot be accessed. However, I have mails and invoices of me paying for the said mailbox.

*Sorry, that is not possible. Only way to verify is to recover the mailbox via email.*

**Me**: You do understand that it's literally impossible to do as there's no way to access the mailbox.

*Sorry. We will not be able to help you. Verifying via other methods is not possible.*

**Me**: So I am paying for Game Pass which would include Ubisoft Connect -games, but you're unwilling to unlink it - even though I've said I can verify that the mailbox is mine. I am not asking you to do anything else but one of these:

+ 1) Unlink the account and let me relink it to an Ubisoft account that has Email I can access
+ 2) allow me linking it to second account as you can see that the account in question hasn't been used for a ~decade
+ 3) send the original mailbox a verification request and if there's no reply in sometime (eg. 24h, 7d, 14d, 30d) -> it would then be unlinked.

*Sorry, nothing can be done.*

The decade old account is something I cannot access, even though I even know the Ubisoft credentials to login with it, BUT as it hasn't been logged in forever - Ubisoft's service is asking for email verification to force a password reset. Or it was hacked and flagged. Same outcome -> I cannot use the original credentials to login.

Absolutely a stellar 10/10 experience.

****

Let's see what happens by approaching them as a completely clueless tool just saying that ""my account has been hacked"" and see where that leads.

****

**EDITS**

Edit 22/01: Found an Ubisoft link directly pointing out if you lost email access. It requires daytime chat with them, so going to see if this path would help. Apparently not open on weekends?

Edit 22/01: I contacted the third party ISP out of curiosity if the 3rd party email address would be accessible. I was lucky and they told me that - yes - it is. As I was a customer for so long time, they accepted to restore my access to it without any cost for the end of the month. Now I have even access to the mailbox, but the recovery methods that Ubisoft have - are not sending any emails to the said email address. :D

****

Edit 23/01: No updates from Ubisoft on this yet. I updated my ticket by telling them that *""oh, there was no hacker after all - it was my account all along. I have restored access to it via a third party ISP by a stroke of luck (no other users registered the email address for them).*

Edit 23/01: Ubisoft personnel, please don't downvote this. Instead solve the issue you've caused!


****

Edit 24/01: The case took an absolutely ridiculous turn.

Ubisoft told me that now when I have managed to recovered access to the email address by a 3rd party ISP, which they told to be the ONLY way to verify my ownership of the account... they have now changed the story!

So I went ahead and bought the standard edition, which I thought I could launch since I had downloaded the ubisoft+ edition already. Nope. When it launches it says to enter a product key, something I didn't receive with my receipt. So I restart ""ubisoft connect"" as they now call it, and I went to the store again and now it doesn't even show that I've purchased the game, it still says ""buy now"". Honestly I don't know what the fuck is going on, but I know I've never been more confused or angry trying to enjoy a game on it's release date.

All in all, thumbs up to Ubisoft :)

Of course, it has its flaws and it’s jank, it’s not an absolutely groundbreaking game at all. But holy shit, it feels like a blast lmao. 

While I do wish there were more places to explore and a bit of a longer story, I’m pretty satisfied with the game as a whole.

They managed to nail the whole Star Wars vibe pretty well, with the markets and environments and such.

There are other games like Shadow Of Mordor GOTY for GOG which works fine as claimed, Football Manager 2022 for Epic Games which also got claimed successfully meaning it can be seen in the library but nothing that is for Ubisoft.

7v8yux,borpriest,1517773025.0,Far Cry 5 Coop - Is it gonna work or is it gonna Ubisoft?,7,8,"Needless to say, games published by Ubisoft, first of all, the AAA titles, are amazing. They always manage to bring something new to the industry, or at least make giant leaps from the previous games in the same series... 

But, what I want to know is how will Ubisoft handle the connectivity issues which the players have been seeing for years now across nearly every Ubisoft IP. EA doesn't ask me to open ports, or send MS Info files to fix something, well at least not in every game. I just pay the price for the game and I can be sure like 90% that I'm gonna be able to play with my friends. I can't remember a single Ubisoft game I've played without experiencing any connectivity ********. And don't get me wrong, I've moved around the world, changed ISPs, and yes, sometimes other publisher's games have kinda the same problems, but it's nothing, compared to this list:

RS: Siege
AC: Brotherhood
Wildlands
For Honor

And, of course, the reason why I am so pissed - Far Cry 4. 

And I'm not even touching upon all the lootboxes stuff. Just the connectivity. 

Was this addressed in any way by Ubisoft? 
What should we expect for Far Cry 5 Coop? 
Because if they're not fixing it, I'm not buying the game.

Yesterday, I received emails about people trying to get in touch with Ubisoft support for my account saying that they forgot the mail address attached to my Ubisoft account. Ubisoft protected my account and didn't let them change my info because they couldn't provide the original mail address used for the account.

But today it happened again and they succeeded at changing the mail address attached to my Ubisoft account. They didn't do it using my mail address (I checked my login activity and, appart from me, no one managed to connect to my mail address and I have 2-steps log in), it's literally Ubisoft support that gave them my account ! They did it during the time which Ubisoft support chat is open and managed to trick them I don't know how since this time I cannot access to the chat transcripts. I received and e-mail saying that the change were successfully made but that I had to click on a link to confirm the changes, and I received another email right after saying that  recent changes happened on my Ubisoft account about my mail address.

I don't know how they did it but I'm freaking out, I put so much money and time in my R6 account and I can't contact anybody at Ubisoft to help me.

What can I do at this point ? Thanks for your time.

EDIT: Well I contacted Ubisoft support and since I can't give them the new mail address the hacker put on my account and I don't know what name he changed mine to, they can't find my account. This is so bs ! They literally gave my whole 7 years account away to someone and I can't do nothing about it !

I went into Uplay and it lists an old card there that expired in March 2019. I guess they must have just added an old card to the billing, so I tried updating it to the new card. It won't let me, it just adds the old card instead. I can't delete the old card, and I can't add my new card to Uplay plus

6sb3l8,mvmiller12,1502165542.0,Ubisoft and the modern gaming dilemma,8,3,"Well, it has been a while since she last attempted to do it, but my wife recently decided that she wanted to finally play through her Assassin's Creed games. I had gotten her the first game years ago and she liked it alot. So over the years I bought her AC2, Brotherhood, Revelations, (and apparently got a freebie of 3, but more on that later). But she never got around to finishing 1 at the time and now she was ready to go again. 

It started simply enough, I installed her disk of Assassin's Creed and away she went. She reached the end of the game and asked me to install the next one, so we sign into her Ubi account and there it is, AC2, and Brotherhood. But Revelations and 3 are both missing. I was concerned at first, but I decided to check my account instead. I've had this happen before where some Sims expansions were bought on MY account instead of hers, and EA moved them over with a simple phone call. Ubi should be at least as good, right?

Well, not so much. I call the Ubi support line, and apparently the phone agents can only help with accounts that can't be signed into. The agent was pleasant though, and opened up a ticket for me to complete so I could handle the issue with a live chat. A hair inconvenient, but not too bad. I completed the ticket with:

My wife owns Assassin's Creed: Revelations and Assassin's Creed III, and yet they seem to have been accidentally registered to my account instead of hers.

I would like for both of these games and keys to be moved from my Ubiplay account (redacted@redacted.com) and moved to hers instead (redacted@redacted.com). Thank you.


and then went into chat, which went like this:


Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:34:31 PM): Thank you for contacting Ubisoft Live Support. Please give me a moment to review your case. In the meantime, feel free to add any additional information that may pertain to your issue, and I will be with you shortly. 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:35:18 PM): Hello. Can you please upload your receipts for Assassin's Creed 3 and Revelations? 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:38:22 PM): I no longer have them 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:38:39 PM): I see. Where did you purchase these games? 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:38:47 PM): I don't remember 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:38:51 PM): This was years ago 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:39:08 PM): It took her a REALLY long time to collect all of those flags in Assassins Creed 1 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:39:52 PM): OK. We do need a receipt to transfer a game. I will also let you know the only version of AC3 you have is the free copy from the 30th anniversary celebration that cannot be moved 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:40:46 PM): Why does it matter if I have a legitimate key/version and no longer need it for it to be moved to her account? I'm not asking for another copy opf the game. I'm asking that it be moved 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:41:10 PM): Since I have it, and it is registered, and it is legit, you shouldn;t need anything else 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:41:23 PM): I do apologize, but that is the requirement for moving the game 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:41:38 PM): That is a load of garbage 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:41:55 PM): If I had physical disks this would not be a problem 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:42:21 PM): I had a similar problem with The Sims and EA, and they had no problem moving that 
either 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:42:37 PM): So why is Ubisoft deciding to be anti-consumer 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:42:38 PM): They have different policies than we do, as they are a different company 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:42:38 PM): ? 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:42:51 PM): Yes - a better one. Hence their better financials 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:42:55 PM): I do truly apologize, but we will need a receipt in order to transfer the games 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:43:07 PM): and they aren't fighting a hostile takeover by Guillemott 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:43:16 PM): THIS is how you lose customers 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:43:42 PM): I am making a simple request. PLease move the games from MY account to MY WIFE's 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:43:58 PM): One moment please 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:45:30 PM): I have verified that in order to move the game, we will need a valid proof of purchase, such as a receipt or invoice. If you do not have those, we cannot move the game. I do truly apologize for any inconvenience this may cause 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:46:07 PM): Why would you need a receipt when it is REGISTERED to my account? How else can you register a game to an account if you didn't buy it??? 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:46:25 PM): We require it to verify your purchase of the game from an approved vendor 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:46:36 PM): And after this chat I will continue to be able to play said game on MY account (which I don;t want to do) 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:46:57 PM): and will still be able to continue to receive apparently subpar support for it if I so choose 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:47:27 PM): And I don't care what you think of  whatever store I bought the game from 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:47:29 PM): That is what we will need to transfer the game. Is there anything else that I can assist you with today? 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:47:38 PM): Yes - move the game 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:47:44 PM): Or get me a manager who will 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:48:06 PM): No one else will move the game for you. If there is nothing else I can assist you with i will need to end this chat 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:48:34 PM): This is pathetic. It explains why you guys are doing so poorly though 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:48:58 PM): I am now boycotting future Ubi titles. Thanks for saving me future money 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:49:21 PM): I am very sorry you feel that way, but I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:49:39 PM): My day will be fine. I just need to log her into my account to play her game 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:49:53 PM): But I'm not purchasing any more Ubi games 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:50:01 PM): And I am telling everyone why. 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:50:24 PM): This was a simple customer service request, and you guys screwed it up. Congratulations 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:50:42 PM): I am sorry you feel that way, but this is the policy 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:51:03 PM): I would advise your corporate masters to rethink their policies 

Ian W (8/7/2017, 11:51:14 PM): I will absolutely forward your feedback 

Me (8/7/2017, 11:51:19 PM): Please do


I will admit I was a little heated by the end there, but this is pretty ridiculous.

1fs9fvm,noswag15,1727630181.0,Things that are not being talked enough about ubisoft's anti-consumer practices ? ,4,20,"I am a bit concerned about how this whole ubisoft fallout is going to play out. Not because I don’t think they deserve it which they absolutely do, but because the online discourse seems to be heavily focused on a few specific mistakes that they’ve been making. And while the things that are being talked about are things that need to be talked about, I am barely seeing any mention of issues like single player games requiring internet to play, the requirement to have a dedicated launcher that gets in the way of playing a game that I own in every possible way, the aggressive and borderline illegal pushing of stuff that requires gamers to spend more money to do even basic things on games that they’ve bought and already fully paid for, their employees asking gamers to be comfortable not owning games to name just a few.

I feel like ubisoft is finally waking up and starting to think about making amends but when no one talks about these deep rooted issues, I feel like the company is going to get the wrong (or insufficient) feedback/message and continue to fail. If I am being honest, I want them to succeed because they make some of my most favourite games but the way they’re doing it is clearly not working.

So I wanted to highlight a few things that \*personally\* irk me. I am sure there are more and some of the issues may not resonate with some and that’s fine. So in no particular order, these are the things that bother \*me\* (and I’m sure several other gamers).

Why does ubisoft lump every gamer into one category and treat us all like shit ? I get it Ubi, you’re a business and you need to make money and when you see people illegally acquiring your products, it might be disheartening so if you want to take measures to prevent or reduce that, by all means go ahead and do it, but can you please not make is so annoying that you end up discouraging people who actually want to buy and play the games ?

When I buy a single player game, I just want it to be installed on my machine and clicking on it should take me straight to the game. Why should I wait for the clunky and ugly launcher to show up an ugly black empty store page and have to stare at it till whatever checks need to be performed and then wait so long till I can actually get to the game’s menu. And especially when there’s an update to either the game or the launcher, I now have to wait even more and click yes to a bunch of UAC prompts and once everything is done, it forgets my login and I have to login every single time. I just want to play my single player game on my gaming handheld device but no .. I have to fumble with entering a long 20 character mix of numbers symbols and hieroglyphs on a tiny virtual keyboard to even get to the next stage. I could install password managers (which I obviously don’t want to on a gaming handheld) to make it easier but I still need to copy and paste the password.

Why can’t I just play the game offline? If a check needs to be performed, do it on some schedule and clearly show when the last check was done and how much longer I have before the next check locks me out. Give options for me to extend the verification by performing an adhoc check so that I can briefly connect to the internet during my travels and “top-up” my access. There are ways to implement validation checks while still maintaining good user experience for legitimate users but it saddens me that the company’s knee-jerk reaction is to implement aggressive checks at the cost of UX for the honestly majority of users. The verification checks themselves .. why do they have to be tied to ubisoft launcher at all ? Why not have a separate lightweight headless process that performs the checks in the background when the game is loading before the menu is shown ? Surely a company as large as ubisoft can figure out a way, right ?

Why is there no update on issues that plague existing games ? Does there have to be million games released in quick succession before the previous ones are even done ? I bought avatar frontiers of pandora and while the reception has generally been lukewarm, I absolutely had a blast playing and sunk around 100 hours in it. \*had\* being the keyword here because the game has suddenly stopped working and asks me to purchase the skybreaker DLC to even play the base game that I’ve already paid for. How is this even legal ? I wanted to give ubisoft the benefit of doubt and thought that this is probably a recently introduced bug that will quickly be patched but no .. looks like this issue is widespread and has been open for months and ubisoft knows about it but still there is no information about when or if it will ever be resolved.

Which brings me to the whole “forced updates” and lack of options to delay or deny updates. Games are software and software will have bugs no matter how well it’s implemented or tested but the audacity of ubisoft to think that they’re infallible, that their servers will never go down and that they will never have bugs when the reality is exactly the opposite is a clear indicator of some evil force within the company that’s acting against well meaning stakeholders. Because there’s no way that actual developers who slog day and night to create these games don’t know about these limitations and the gamers also know these because they face these routinely. So it looks like ubisoft’s management is absolutely out of touch and is in the middle of this whole mess because it’s pretty clear that the management made decisions to rush out unfinished products. Even worse is the complete silence and the way the company just shrugs it off as business as usual. No wonder people don’t trust ubisoft. Something drastically needs to change in order to win back the lost trust.

Why do I HAVE to login to a ubisoft account to play assassins creed on a playstation 5 ? It slowly crept in. First it was not required at all. Then an option to login was added but was not mandatory. Then with Valhalla, it suddenly became mandatory to login to a ubisoft account in order to play a game that I bought on playstation ? Why ? It got so annoying that eventually I caved and logged in, only to have a severely degraded experience. The game which was buttery smooth before on PS5 started to have micro stutters every now and then. Not to mention all the useless avenge quests bugging out and constantly bombarding the screen with crap like “XYZ has been slain. Avenge their death” or something along those lines. More filler padding on an already padded game just doing the same thing over and over again. It got to a point that I couldn’t do a single action in the game without the same “avenge” notification popping up with an annoyingly loud sound (I am talking like a notification every second type frequent). I dropped the game right there and never looked back. Why do I not have an option to say “no” to the forced login ? why can’t I just peacefully play the game (which I paid a premium for) in peace ?

Engage with the users more actively please ? Don’t treat users as cash cows to milk till death, eh ? Why not have an honest conversation like a reddit AMA or some channel that the company is comfortable with and take criticism constructively instead of gaslighting everyone ? Sure, there are always going to be people who take it too far with their criticism but the solution is not to assume everyone is like that and turn a blind eye. In fact, there’s so much backlash because there are so many problems and while some people may not know how to voice them properly, it’s absolutely important to listen to the ones that are willing to have a discussion and willing to provide feedback ? Why not be transparent when issues are reported by acknowledging them and giving routine status updates instead of leaving users hanging ? Isn’t that basic courtesy to show to people who have trusted the company enough to spend their time and money in ?

Do better Ubisoft.

P.S. I posted this on r/gaming but got removed saying I need to already be an active contributor on the sub to make posts so I'm trying my luck here. Hope I'm not breaking any rules (I have checked the sidebar).

TLDR; There is no perfect company and it's impossible to please everyone and every company inadvertently upsets a few of them but somehow ubisoft has managed to upset a vast majority of its consumers with a wide variety of issues but only the DEI and lack of polish are being talked about while the other issues are not being talked about enough.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fs9fvm/things_that_are_not_being_talked_enough_about/,2024-09-30 01:16:21
10gae8q,From_Gaming_w_Love,1674155689.0,Reflections of an angry gamer: How Ubisoft failed us AND shareholders.,6,3," Beating a dead horse here but one more plop on the pile can't hurt. I'm not meaning to lecture you guys and I know Ubisoft doesn't monitor this sub but I wanted to put this ""out there."" The internet has lots of room so here we go:

**TL:DR-** 

**1) Deliver the game you promise**

**2) Provide SOME measure of support for your products through their life cycle or AT LEAST as long as you're promoting it / selling it full price (cough- or putting it on gamepass)**

**3) Engage with the community in a genuine way**

**4) Preserve / Protect our progress like it matters**  
 

Gamers weren't always mainstream but now that we are and the time we spend consuming content is extremely valuable. If we estimated only 1% of the global population plays computer games roughly the 8.6 hour per week average, this is roughly 80 million people sitting down for almost 3/4 of a billion hours PER WEEK.  
 

The gaming industry is highly competitive and eager to shake all the money out of our pockets to sustain growth to what the google machine tells me will reach roughly 225 billion dollars in 2023. And we're usually more than happy to oblige them but it comes with a few very basic conditions: We want the game you promise, we want it to work, we want to feel as if our opinion matters and we want our progress to be preserved.  
 

Are any of these things impractical or unfair? I don't think so... I want to take a walk down memory lane with a few of you who have been around for awhile in hopes that maybe these reflections will put a spotlight on exactly how catastrophically Ubisoft missed the mark on ALL of them. I'll keep it basic since this is opinion based only but feel free to expand on the things that matter to you and the titles you play.    
 

**We want the game you promise: Underhype and overdeliver.**  
 Breakpoint is really the only experience I have here and even then most of what was promised was more through the association with Tom Clancy and Ghost Recon. With that comes a certain expectation of a ""gritty technomilitary shooter."" Breakpoint would have been fine if they'd just dumped the Tom Clancy / Ghost Recon association. So much of what made it a colossal failure was a complete disregard for that brand and the man behind it- they might as well have gone ahead and just called their recent boondoggle ""Tom Clancy Ghost Recon: Skull and Bones.""  
 

With the promises come claims of innovation and of course this comes with an element of risk- there was nothing innovative about Breakpoint... except that we ""were able to blouse our boots."" Feel free to blouse your hip waders Mr. CEO man as you wade through this ocean of \[censored\] you and your company have found yourself in.  
 

**We want it to work: Customer support for the win!**  
 In what I can only assume was a cost cutting measure, technical / customer support is among the worst in the industry. Ubi-Drones, for the most part, patrol the forums and social media hungry for opportunities to copy and paste often irrelevant instructions to deflect away from known but hidden issues. The debacle with Wildlands servers comes to mind... and to add insult to injury instead of acknowledging this they made it worse by expanding the reach of Wildlands to Gamepass- making the game almost unplayable for anyone. Ongoing promises to ""get the information to the team and get back if there are any developments"" are completely empty and a months long challenge for ANY drone to give a SINGLE example of where ""the team"" came up with a solution or relevant feedback on ANY Ghost Recon title over the last couple years has remained unfulfilled. Wildlands players were only able to keep playing since so many got frustrated by not being able to play they moved on to other titles... This left room for the rest of us to keep playing the game we continue to love.  
 

**We want to feel as if our opinion matters:** Engage the with the community who love your title!   
 Not everyone cares enough about what they play to ""put it out there"" but when folks weigh in on any number of platforms / forums / social media et al, it's with an enthusiasm that warrants some consideration. Of course it's not practical to expect a personal response all the time, but SOME sort of acknowledgement to the broader community messaging would go a long way. Ubisoft dumped years of passionate discourse when it converted over to this absolutely atrocious forum... This is- bar none- the worst forum I've ever been on and as a guy in this generation of gamers, gaming forums were pretty much a staple. You can keep your facebook and twitter trash... I come to the ""official forum"" with some expectations and the clunky, nonsensical layout and functionality of whatever you call this at the expense of all the conversations we've had specifically on the topic of trying to get Breakpoint off the rocks... it's just inexcusable.  
 

**We want our progress to matter: Don't delete our fucking stats!**  
 Maybe even worst of all- back in about May when (almost?) everyone had all their stats wiped in Wildlands and the answer was ""It's a legacy title so we can't do anything about it"" was maybe the biggest slap in the face for gamers- many of whom give themselves little challenges as part of the distracting element the game provides. The sense of accomplishment is palpable- especially to get through emotionally trying times like... oh I don't know- pandemics? So to have all of that progress thrown in the trash with no explanation or recourse is disgusting. Gamers will no longer trust that their progress matters and as a result will be less likely to invest time OR money into future Ubisoft titles until there is a high level commitment... lol nevermind. Even a high level commitment from the CEO is empty and meaningless. Not even sure why I'm wasting my time writing this- this entire mess can rest squarely on his shoulders. That management team sat on this problem and filled their pockets with our money while their little community cheerleaders ran around helping to cover it all up with fake promises or outright lies is disgusting- and THAT'S the taste we have in our mouths in consideration of ""Ubisoft.""  
 

And it's not just us- clearly this reputation... all of the complaining from all the gamers about all the titles speaks through record low sales and a company in financial crisis piloted by greedy rich people. You don't need to be a financial expert to recognize that Ubsioft- starting at the VERY top- got greedy and tried coasting to easy money on the backs of the passionate gaming community. Regaining that trust after such widespread disrespect for what gamers care about may -literally- be impossible given Ubisoft's immaculate track record for failing to deliver...

eg6s9z,mosfet182,1577423555.0,$hit Company with $hit security. Lost my account.,5,10,"First off, we all know the customer support is bad. They have failed me time and time again so I just don't bother going through hoops to get an answer anymore. Especially after today.   


Second, How can security for this company be SO bad?   
I use a password manager to randomly generate a complex password with 2 factor authentication and it seems around once or twice a month, I get the email ""Someone logged into your account, oh boy!""   
Cool. So I do my monthly routine with this site. Go to the official page, change my account info back to English, change my password to something random, and wait for it all to happen again, but this time I couldn't even log in. It appears that people other than me in different countries are able to login with my account without needing my 2FA code, and just straight up removing it and put it on their phone. So now I am locked out of MY account and guess what, ubisoft support won't help. All my games, gone. All my progress, gone. All of my hope for this company, gone.   


Yeah I'm pissed, but hey, maybe their login servers will go down so no one can login.

It's not just this particular giveaway that is giving me the error message - I can't log into the account management site or any other Ubisoft service on the web.

r2ylyu,SkyyHighhh,1637966192.0,Ubisoft Connect and Rainbow Six not opening FIX,5,0,"It was a Friday night, playing some rainbow six with my friends and had a good time. Left Saturday for the day and nothing changed on my pc. I came back Sunday to play with my friends again and was trying to launch siege on steam and the game would never launch. So I tried opening up ubisoft connect and it was doing the same thing that Siege was doing on steam. My cursor would have a blue spinning circle as it was loading ubisoft connect but then a few seconds later disappear and wouldn't launch. It would show up in my task manager for about 2-3 seconds and disappear and wouldn't start.

Let me just tell you of all the things I tried to do to fix it. I tried running the game and Ubisoft connect as administrator. I tried restarting my pc. I tried reinstalling ubisoft connect countless times. I tried clearing my cache folder in the files for ubisoft connect. I tried launching the game/ubisoft connect in safe mode with networking. I updated all my drivers, software and graphic card. I tried running malware protection and anti virus programs and my system was all clean. I even tried completely factory resetting my entire PC. I have tried every possible thing reddit and other websites suggested to do and no matter what I tried, the ubisoft connect would refuse to open.

I then decided hell with it, I will contact ubisoft support. I filed a ticket with them and they actually got back to me very fast with the online in real life text chat support. They suggested a whole variety of things to do. Such as starting game in safe mode with networking, reinstalling Ubisoft app, disabling all apps on starting menu then restart the computer and running anti virus programs to see if an app was blocking the signal of ubisoft connect. Nothing worked and they gave up on me! Never texted me back and didnt email me back anymore.

I decided to do some real digging into my issue. And after literally countless hours tearing my hair out of my head trying to figure out how to fix this issue, I gave up. I decided to call a local computer repair place to help me out. I scheduled an appointment and they connected to my pc and the technician spent around 2 hour trying to resolve my issue. He was a very knowledgeable technician and he could not figure out the reason ubisoft connect wouldn't open.

Finally after days of trying to fix the issue, it worked! Now you might be asking yourself how? It was easy. I had to take my computer into the store so they could literally erase my hard drive, reinstall windows and do hardware diagnostics on my pc. Everything came up clean, no issues with my computer but what changed was Ubisoft connect finally opened!

&#x200B;

In conclusion, if you are having this issue like me, DO NOT waste your time trying to figure out what it is. You can try doing what I did to fix it and I hope it works for you but if it doesn't, You have to take it into a store to fix it. I know ubisoft sucks major donkey ass but it is what it is. Good luck to you my friends and I hope no one ever has this issue again because it was an absolute pain in my ass.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/r2ylyu/ubisoft_connect_and_rainbow_six_not_opening_fix/,2021-11-27 06:36:32

ybozaw,Stunning-Concern1854,1666549356.0,I wish that Ubisoft would consider doing a remake or at least a remaster of Dark Planet: Battle for Natrolis,5,0,"Hoping that anyone here has played it and remembers. Ubisoft was its publisher. But it was a part of my childhood although very briefly (that is until my CD broke and I could no longer play it). I've managed to find a copy of it online but I could not play it well due to the game being old and it not being compatible to modern hardware. I can play it but if there are too much units, then it gets to be too laggy that I could not see what was happening. 

There's a mission for the Sorin (the dragon-looking humanoids with Chinese/Japanese-like culture/aesthetics) where I really have to engage all of my units and make sure that I use each of their skills to fight off the Colonists (humans). But since there's a lot of units involved, it gets too laggy that the next thing that happens is that most of my units or the unit that I have to keep alive gets killed. 

That game has so much potential but it has a rather clunky control and it's very hard to play these days. You can't order your units to attack a non-specific area where they will attack any enemies on sight. So you have to manually keep watch on them. Also, it gets pretty painful to have to constantly change the speed of the game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/ybozaw/i_wish_that_ubisoft_would_consider_doing_a_remake/,2022-10-24 02:22:36

my5kn8,Renegade_Guy,1619346429.0,My Assassin's Creed Games won't start,5,3,"It has been a long journey for me. I have been fighting to be able to play the AC games for months now.

I was able to play the first two games fine without any issues at the end of last year. When I wanted to start Brotherhood, none of the games besides Origins and Odyssey were starting anymore, not even the first 2 games even though I was able to play them fine not to long before this. Nothing about my System had changed. (Every other game I own, which includes other Ubisoft titles work fine btw.)

I tried:

\- going through Ubisoft support (without any progress because their support is utter garbage and offers nothing but boiler plate answers)

\- verified and reinstalled every AC game I own (which is all of them besides Valhalla and the sidescrolling games)

\- freshly installed Windows (twice!)

none if those helped, the games just refused to start...

Then I had an epiphany!

Why don't I try to play them on Linux? So I installed Ubuntu as dual boot alongside my Windows 10 installation. And who would have thought it, but I managed to play through the entirety of Brotherhood and about a third of Revelations without a single hitch.

Then Windows 10 had an update and the next time I tried to boot into Ubuntu it just froze on the startup screen. Tried a couple more times but it always froze up at that screen.

So, just out of pure desperation I tried to install Revelations on Windows again (must have been the 5th time by now) AND IT WORKED!!! I finished the game and wanted to move on the the third game but...

Yeah, didn't start...again... (the normal version and the remastered version btw.)

So I looked up how to delete Linux from my system so I could maybe try do a fresh install of that and try to play the games there again before Windows fucks everything up again, but now every time I try to boot from the USB I want to install Ubuntu from I just get booted straight into GNU Grub and I haven't been able to find a solution to this anywhere... 

So now I am at the exact point I was a couple of weeks ago...frustrated and angry and I do not have a clue as to what I can do

I inform them of this and they refuse to help me since I cannot provide a screenshot of the xbox account being used on a console. Even though I use it to play game pass on PC.

GG Ubisoft, thanks to the robotic anti-logic your support agents use, I now have an xbox account trapped to an ubisoft account I can no longer access and I cannot begin to recover that account because you need me to take a screenshot of my xbox account on an Xbox, even though there is no Xbox.

My ubisoft account is linked to my xbox account and I used to have game pass for a while and I fully own both games on xbox could it be that somehow my gamepass used to let me play the games on ubisoft connect on pc? I don't see how it could be related but I can't think of any other explanation. 

I've created a support ticket, hopefully they'll tell me what exactly did I pay for and what do I need to buy cause I don't see anything on the account's transactions page.

  
Anyone had this happen before? Does the xbox account have anything to do with it? Before you say, I'm positive this isn't a case of a wrong account, I only have 2 accounts, this is my main one linked to xbox, the other is a one I created for pc specifically but I don't use it anymore and I only have 2 hours in Origins in it so it couldn't be it.

Right, can i just say how awful their Uplay platform is? Thought hey, im gonna get an uplay subscription, I tried doing it first, claimed it went trough but it didin't, i checked my bank and bam, 14+ euros on hold from ubisoft. Pissed Because I dont keep ton of money in my account, couldnt buy it anymore. tried with my other bank account and it would either auto reject or claim it went trough when it didin't though this time no holding charges. Anyway i tried couple of times with my usual card again, it claims it went trough, but then you reset a page and it would go back to ""do you wish to reactivate uplay plus "" state. Finally i gave up, how the fuck did the whole thing passed QA testing is beyond me as the purchase page would always glitch out, showing and not allowing to change billing addresses (it just showed random billing address), i managed to change it trough ubisoft website but still same shit would happen. Come back today, still 15 euros on hold still no subscription. I check my purchase history (which before was blank) and i see this gem. They tried to charge me for like 7-8 subscriptions. Are you fucking kidding me? luckily , i never store more than 20 euros in my bank card, however, im wondering if i had 100 euros, if they would actually take it to hold again.

Well I changed everything on it (this thief typed all his personal info on my acc including full name and phone number, yes, police is working on it already XD) i attempted to download Rainbow Six Siege, and it appeared my account is banned permanently.

So I made another ticket. Well after a week a guy named Tomek from Ubisoft Support Team said 
>""*Sorry, but there is nothing we can do. Ban is permanent. Men who investigated your case noticed, that not allowed activity happened AFTER you got your account back*"".

When I asked him can he send an appeal once again he said

I apologise in advance if this post irritates anyone reading this wall of text.",4,16,"Hi.First off, I am aware that this is a community-run Reddit and that staff here can not help with this issue, I just hope it brings enough awareness and hope this does not happen to you either.

Let's start from the top! I pre-ordered Assassin's Creed: Unity (Gold Edition) in 2014. And due to the rough launch, in December there was a promo where you could choose a free Ubisoft game from a few to select from. And I chose Far Cry 4. I filled out everything and received my code. My code was invalid so I contacted Ubisoft Support on the 19th of December 2014 to receive one that works. After verifying I am the owner of my account, I received the code from an Ubisoft employee to redeem, and I redeemed it. That promo is long gone now, and it is causing me a big issue now, I will tell you more on that later.

Around 1-2 months ago I changed the alias of my email to a better looking one, from \[old email alias) to (new email alias). I still played my Ubisoft games as per usual. However, on the 6th of September 2023 I was prompted to log in again, which I struggled with because I needed the OTP for the email that doesn't exist anymore. I also had my number changed, not a new SIM, but directly changed through my provider. I forgot that was also used for my Ubisoft account.

However, the next day I remembered I can use the recovery codes that I had on the email. Since it is the same email used for my Ubisoft account, but with a new alias, I still have most my old emails. So I did log in eventually, but I am unable to verify my account so I can play R6S Ranked again since I can not verify the email, so I must change it. I was too stupid to deactivate 2FA trying to change my email, and now I can not play Ranked, I managed to change my number though to the new one.

In order to verify I am the owner of my account I must send a screenshot of ""proof of purchase"" of Far Cry 4 from Steam. And I know how to navigate Steam to find my Purchase History, and find the game to show the details. Now here is the huge problem I am facing. Far Cry 4 is not listed in my Purchase History. The code I received was from an Ubisoft employee back in 2014, I did not buy the game, so there is no ""purchase receipt"", and it simply does not exist.

Yet, even after telling that to 10+ employees, going back and forth 50+ times via email, providing many screenshots, 5 YT videos, and a screen recording showcasing everything I have just explained above, my whole Steam Purchase History, my previous emails, the email where I received the code etc I am still getting a semi-automated reply to show them a purchase receipt of Far Cry 4 from Steam for verification.

Just for clarification, I still have full access to my Ubisoft account thanks to the recovery codes, the only problem is changing the email to the new alias. I can even show 2 recent purchases from Ubisoft with bank transactions and I know they will still not accept it, same with screen sharing my full desktop and showing everything.

There is no such thing as a transaction receipt because I did not buy the game. There is no such thing as a transaction email, because I did not buy the game. There is no such thing as a transaction receipt from being gifted because I was not gifted the game. I was given the code from an Ubisoft employee via email in a case from 2014, via email. And no matter how many times I explicitly explain this, I am still being asked for something that doesn't exist at all.

I am seriously at a crossroads and I sincerely hope I can find even just 1 Ubisoft employee that understands what's even going on. I pray that none of you have to experience this.

rdvgxb,Ricco95,1639211749.0,AC Odyssey transfer to DX 12,3,0,"AC Odyssey is known for its erratic resource management, which increases the load on processors and reaches 100% even on the most powerful configurations. Why did you Ubisoft the last couple of updates to the game, did not think to transplant the game to the DX 12 API, but only added cosmetics like the Ezio and Viking costume, as well as minor minor fixes. many companies and developers are moving their old games to new graphics APIs for better performance. Example: Rene classic DX 11 and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice DX 12. You are a large company and don't do anything to improve the performance and optimization of your games after the end of the so-called official support. It is also logical that after the end of this period, people should stop playing these games and switch to new ones, but this does not happen. you should also stop selling these games in favor of new ones, which also does not happen, but at the same time you do not seek to improve the gaming experience of people who bought your games, they should do it themselves with the help of third-party fixes, although it will not be difficult for you to fix it. you could fix the AC 3 Remastered with its poor models and lack of dynamic lighting. I don't think it's that difficult for you. You could fix the wrong kernel load in AC Ezio Trilogy for the new OS. But all I hear in response to complaints is ""Support for old games has been discontinued"", then everyone should stop buying them, because their gaming experience will not be as pleasant as stated. it's a shame to see how simple indie studios value their players and provide them with the best experience despite the release date of their game. unlike AAA companies with a million-dollar fortune. it was a little longer than I expected to write, but these problems are taking place.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/rdvgxb/ac_odyssey_transfer_to_dx_12/,2021-12-11 16:35:49

I managed to get a ticket made to the support and I said clearly, that my real e-mail isn't the e-mail linked to the account. After about 10 minutes I was logged out of the browser (but not the app). I wasn't able to get back in the website ever since.

Even after logging out of the Ubisoft App, I can just press play on Riders Republic in the Epic Games app and it automatically loggs me in into the Ubisoft App. I'm just not able to log into the account management website and the support site either.

I will try contacting support tommorow when the chat is live. Do you think I can now get my account back with that evidence?

Ubisoft Support chat was really helpful and allowed me to verify the authenticity of my claims by sending in 3 different screenshots of my Xbox account that is linked to the stole account.

18ha92j,DependentAioli48,1702447746.0,Attention Ubisoft: We want a Division-inspired MMO Survival Zombie Game!,3,18,"Ever since The Division captivated us with its immersive world and tactical gameplay, many of us have dreamt of a similar experience in a zombie apocalypse. Imagine the tension of scavenging for resources, the thrill of building a base with friends, and the adrenaline rush of facing hordes of the undead with high-powered weaponry and gear.

**Why a Division-inspired MMO Survival Zombie Game?**

* **Proven Groundwork:** The Division's engine and gameplay mechanics are a perfect foundation for a captivating survival experience. The cover-based shooting, loot system, and character progression would translate seamlessly to a zombie-infested world.
* **Endless Possibilities:** An MMO format allows for a vast and dynamic world where thousands of players can interact, compete, and cooperate. Imagine forming communities, trading resources, and establishing settlements to survive in the wasteland.
* **Fresh Perspective:** While The Division is fantastic, a new IP allows for complete creative freedom. Imagine a diverse world with unique environments, factions, and lore. This could be a chance for Ubisoft to explore a new post-apocalyptic narrative that resonates with a wider audience.

**What we want to see:**

* **Deep Survival Mechanics:** Players should constantly need to manage hunger, thirst, and health. Crafting, scavenging, and base building should be crucial to survival.
* **Tactical Combat:** The Division's cover-based shooting and gear customization would be perfect for tense encounters with hordes of zombies. Different zombie types with unique weaknesses and behaviors would add strategic depth.
* **Meaningful Player Interaction:** The MMO format allows for social aspects like trading, forming alliances, and competing in events. A robust guild system and player-driven economy would further enhance the community experience.
* **Evolving World:** Regular content updates, seasonal events, and world-altering events would keep the game fresh and exciting.

**Ubisoft, we know you have the talent and resources to create a truly groundbreaking game. Give us the Division-inspired MMO survival zombie game we've been waiting for! We believe it will be a massive success and solidify Ubisoft's position as a leader in the gaming industry.**

**Let's make this happen, Ubisoft!**

17lie40,Theiix26,1698862337.0,Refund policy after 14 days,3,5,"Hello! I have purchased The Crew Motorfest a while before it went live (so over 14 days ago). 

I did not try to open it in the first month after it went live, so I didn't know, but apparently the game won't load. I would wait over 20 minutes looking at my desktop and seeing that the game is loading, but it would never actually launch the game.

I have recently contacted Ubisoft support and asked for a refund, but they denied, claiming it goes against their Terms.

The Terms do state that refunds should be requested in the first 14 days after the transaction, but they also say:  ""this refund policy does not override any statutory rights for refund, including your legal right to ask for a refund in the event of a faulty product""

I managed to play during the Beta period just fiiiine, so why is it that the full game, that I paid for (over 100$), won't work? Isn't this, in any way, a 'faulty product'?

They also asked for files and confirmation that my computer meets the min req, which they both got from me.

They have denied my refund request 3 times and the supervisor request 2 times. I work in customer support and I know that I could have spoken to someone higher in regards to this. I feel like, since I couldn't enjoy an item I paid for, I should be eligible for a refund, but clearly they don't agree.

I put it into the box, and I played the game for a few months, then uninstalled it.

A few days ago, I wanted to play the game again, so I downloaded the game. But, as soon as I try to launch the game, the launcher seems to load the game, but the process is abruptly interrupted and the game does not even start up. Then, I tried to execute it from the shortcut located in my desktop, and now the launcher is demanding me the key I used two years ago, even though I'd already put it a long time ago. Anyways, I found the key, put it into the box and it says 'this key has already been used, find the game in your library'.

I have tried everything to solve this issue. I set the game as administrator, did some compatibility thing, tried to fix it from the task manager, uninstalled and installed both the game and the launcher multiple times, yet nothing has worked so far. This is a fucking scam, I'm not being allowed to pay something I paid for. Has any of you ever experienced this issue.

The key I bought IS NOT for Steam, it's for Ubisoft Connect.

  
Edit: Dude, what the fuck? Why are so many people downvoting me? All I did was to point out an error that doesn't let me play something I paid for. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1equpzj/i_bought_a_ac_iii_original_key_for_ubisoft/,2024-08-13 08:55:52

Ubi-Defused: Hello.
TilluGuru: Hi
Ubi-Defused: You can launch the game on any platform, however you will need to have it purchased on said platform.
TilluGuru: yes i am planing to buy on PC but i have heard game has some acttivation limit
Ubi-Defused: Yes, 1 single account is the activation limit.
TilluGuru: on how many Pcs ?
Ubi-Defused: You can play it on any PC as long as you have access to the Ubisoft Connect account you activated the game on.
TilluGuru: just for instance my friend just bought the game Watch dogs legions and he run it on 4 Pc  and after that he tried to run it on another PC and it gave him an error saying 'Game is not Activated please try again later'
Ubi-Defused: I do not have any information about that. Unless, of course it is a physical copy ?
Ubi-Defused: But no, it should not be an issue.
Ubi-Defused: Once a game is activated on a Ubisoft account - it stays there forever.
Ubi-Defused: You can launch any Ubisoft Connect app on any PC and it will work.
TilluGuru: really can you please check with someone in your team...its an issue and i am afraid to buy the game now
TilluGuru: there is some activation limit and there is some time period when you get the activation back to not get the error again
TilluGuru: but i saw that error myself
TilluGuru: i mean if i am an owner of a product does it really matter onmany machines i run that product on
Ubi-Defused: Nope, it really does not as long as the correct account is logged in.
Ubi-Defused: The account will have to be unlogged on all other PCs.
TilluGuru: suppose i buy the game and run it on 6-7 systems to check the game performance on different system and it gives me the ACTIVATION ERROR , how would you help me 
TilluGuru: i am really surprised that you have no idea about it..am surprised
Ubi-Defused: This has never been brought to my attention to be honest.
Ubi-Defused: My manager here confirms it should not be an issue as long as you are logged in the correct Ubisoft account.
TilluGuru: even i checked it on your forums but couldnt get a solution to it and i thought to contact ubisoft myself
TilluGuru: 😄 you must be joking, may i know your name for future reference if i may encounter this issue, do you give your words to resolve it immediately
Ubi-Defused: Ubi-Defused here. I cannot promise anything. However as mentioned before, you should be good to go as long as you are logged in the correct account on the Ubisoft connect app.
TilluGuru: may i communicate with someone looking after game DRM related issues
TilluGuru: please connect me

However, I have had 2FA activated on my account for a while. Somehow, this African country had been marked as a trusted browser/location. I have never been anywhere near there so I'm stumped of how this could happen.

I'm headed to England. Great stuff. I'm pumped for the rest of the game, and all of a sudden it just turns off mid-game. I'm back on my desktop and I see a message. I haven't paid for my Ubisoft+ subscription. Okay fair enough, pretty harsh to just cut me off like that, like I'm in the desert dying of thirst and Ubisoft gives me a bottle of water and just rips it out of my hand after like 2 gulps but it's fine I'll pay it. So I renew my subscription... and nothing happens. Strange, but these things can take time I get it. I quit Uplay and log out and log back in and nope. Nothing. I check my bank account and it's all paid for, so why can't I play? Turns out my account is suspended so even though I've renewed it I have to wait for them to unsuspend it which can take days. I've been staring at the wall for like 5 hours now and not 1 word from support at all, I had to go digging around on your buggy support page for answers. We download your shitty launcher and support you and give you money and you make us wait to play. Like I get it's just a game and I'll probably be able to play it tomorrow and I should stop crying but this seems incredibly scummy and stupid.

jma9tp,tencentofAlbion,1604265486.0,[for previous Uplay+ subscribers] Check your Uplay+ subscription status before reactivating,2,3,"My Uplay+ subscription status was marked as *Suspended* and I hadn't noticed this prior to re-purchasing subscription. I say this for later on as initially it had to do with my being unable to access Uplay+. I open Uplay to play and I still see a $14.99 ad under the Ubisoft+ tab, even after re-logging. Nothing changed, as if I had never paid for it. I checked my email for a receipt of my payment but nothing.

I visit *My Subscription* and I notice that my Uplay+ plan status says suspended and no other Uplay+ order, aside from the only I made last year, is listed as having been made under Invoices. I go to find information in the FAQs and I find \[this article\]([https://support.ubisoft.com/en-US/Faqs/000050951](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-US/Faqs/000050951)) on Uplay+ suspended subscription statuses. This is some of what it says(ellipses mine):

>While your subscription is suspended, you will not be able to access any of the games that you have been provided with UPLAY+. To regain access to the service, please make a payment with your existing payment method or change it via the SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT PAGE...  
>  
>...  
>  
>Please note that your games will be accessible again once your subscription status shows as ***Active*** on the *MY SUBSCRIPTION* page...

I updated my payment information. The reason I assume my payment went through is because I didn't receive a error after having confirmed the payment to Uplay+, and I was redirected to a landing page other than the payment form page where I had checked-out my subscription to the service.

This means I had to wait until support was available and got back to me since I didn't want to pay twice after having resolved the suspended status, the first payment(or so I thought) having occurred after I had payed the first time but no verification email which for me means I'd rather wait another day then have to wait for a charge to be reversed.

Chat support(phenomenal btw) was available and they said the following:

>So when you first subscribe you will see a charge of $14.99 (or whatever it may cost in your region based on taxes)  
>  
>That will be the authorization hold. A few hours later you will see a second charge of $14.99 and that will be the actual payment  
>  
>That first charge, the authorization hold, will be released in the next few days by your bank. So it will only cost $14.99 total  
>  
>So be sure you have enough funds available for 2x the cost of the sub. The first of the two charges gets returned

That last one is important!!

Support ended on the note that no payment was shown as being processed on their end, which I had asked and they reiterated since I was advised to try re-activating Uplay+ on both Uplay game launcher and Ubisoft's website, and both methods responded with general error messages which meant I couldn't re-activate *yet*. And they said I should try again later, minimum in an hour and up to one day (I hope not but yay it's basically solved):

>I'd say give it an hour or so at first, and perhaps a day after. Yeah no worries about payments. It looks like the error it's having is it's unable to process the request to resub, rather than a payment of any kind.

**tl;dr** Resubscribers, don't forget to check your Uplay+ subscription status under My Subscription under your avatar after logging into Ubisoft's website before re-activating as it might help you avoid this minor-not-so-minor delay.

Have fun playing Watch Dogs Legion!

I came across a video on Reddit about R6 gameplay and just sparked a mood in me for playing it again.

Once I started the launcher and the game, everything computed really slow. The loading screen was taking ages, looking at operators inside the game was taking too long to load (as if the game was frozen) and now I'm trying to uninstall Wildlands which is taking a VERY long time. And all while the main window showing me (the menus) that I have a thousand FPS before the specific action that slows me down.

I have everything installed on a SSD which has never failed me in other games (WoW, LoL, etc) and it's weird that after trying to return to Ubisoft games after a long time (and most certaintly many patches applied) this entire ""ecosystem"" is just crawling to perform the very basic of stuff.

It's clear that this is some kind of glitch, I'm trying to uninstall everything and install it back again (turn it off and on again, amirite?) but even that takes ages.

My computer may not be the latest generation but it's not a BAD one either (Ryzen 5 3600 / SSDs up the wazoo, RTX 2060, 32GB RAM, good coolers with low temps etc). 

I don't understand what's going on with Uplay Connect and their games. How am I, as a returning player, supposed to enjoy their games if I get hit with this kind of slowness? The launcher and the game won't even appear as ""unresponsive"" in the Task Manager.

I had AC Odyssey on that steam account and AC 3 that were present on Ubisoft Connect too since the accounts were linked. Later, I changed my steam account.

It didn't work. I checked, the account weren't linked, the option to remind me of linking steam account next time I launched a steam game was checked. Well, I bought another game, Assassin's Creed 1.

Not sure if anyone is able to help here or if this is the correct sub (wasn‘t allowed to post for some reason on /r/immortalsfenyxrising), but whenever I launch the game I get to the starting screen where it says the „press any button to continue“ when I press any button the game crashes. 

I have tried re-downloading the game, ubisoft launcher, restarting computer before and after redownloading both things, clearing the ubisoft cache? (i saw on forums that renaming the cache folder something else might work), making sure that both Immortals Fenyx and the ubisoft launcher are under the same folder, tried launching from ubisoft connect and from the desktop icon and nothing works. I played the game earlier today just fine and now suddenly it just doesnt wanna start even.... anyone know what might be the issue? Thanks!

Edit: tried verifying the files, tried launching as System Admin, Tried also doing this fix which I saw on reddit: „I experienced this issue with some AC games in the past and guessed that it may be the same problem. There was a post that documented a fix here: https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthrea...e-Spaces/page2

I will expand on that and try to make the instructions to fix Fenyx Rising here as clear as possible. It seems the problem with installing Fenyx Rising on a secondary drive narrows down to the audio files and video files. Somehow the game doesn't like these files to sit on another other drive other than C drive or a drive that is not managed by Windows Storage Spaces. In the case for most of us who have secondary drives, such as D or E or F etc, most of the time they happen to be drives that are managed by Windows Storage Spaces.

The fix:

Install Fenyx Rising in your secondary drive (in my case, it is the D drive) and move the bare minimum files into C drive. So far from my preliminary findings, the bare minimum files are all the audio files and video files. Fortunately, they reside simply in two folders: (do check your own installation folder path.)

D:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Immortals Fenyx Rising\sounddata

D:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Immortals Fenyx Rising\videos

Cut and paste these two folders into your C drive. In my case I just created the same file path to make things easier. So I moved them respectively to:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Immortals Fenyx Rising\sounddata

C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Immortals Fenyx Rising\videos

Next, is to run your Command Prompt with administrative rights. We are going to create a Directory Junction. Sort of a system shortcut to trick the program into thinking those files still reside in the D drive.

in command prompt, type and press enter:

mklink /J ""D:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Immortals Fenyx Rising\sounddata"" ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Immortals Fenyx Rising\sounddata""

and

mklink /J ""D:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Immortals Fenyx Rising\videos"" ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Immortals Fenyx Rising\videos""

(do replace the folder paths to the one you are using)

You should have notification that ""Junction created for..."" after each command. Check in your original Immortals Fenyx Rising folder that you have two shortcut folders named sounddata and videos to verify you have done this right.“ When I tried doing that it just said: „cant create data file.

***Me:*** I believe I was approved for the One-Time Exception where I can have my account unlinked and that was going to happen after I provided verification which I did. I'd like that decision overturned or I'd like to know what these ""limitations"" preventing it from happening are. With all due respect launching Siege through Ubisoft Connect completely crashes my PC as I've stated in the first message so I'd like to be able to play on Steam because of your application's instability. Thank you. I look forward to a reasonable response

Ubisoft SupportScytheFR, 21 Sep 2024Dear Ubisoft Support,  
  
I hope this message finds you well.  
  
***Me:*** I am respectfully requesting a reconsideration of the decision to deny my request to unlink my Ubisoft account from Steam. As mentioned, I believe I was approved for a one-time exception to unlink the account, and I have already provided the necessary verification for this process. I understand there may be limitations, but I would greatly appreciate further clarification on what specific policies or technical issues are preventing this unlinking.  
  
Additionally, I would like to emphasize the technical difficulties I am experiencing when launching Rainbow Six Siege via Ubisoft Connect, which results in my computer freezing. This issue significantly impacts my gameplay experience, and playing through Steam has been the most stable solution for me. I've never been able to play through Steam on my main account. Therefore, I kindly request a second review of my case or guidance on how I might proceed, as the current situation is not only frustrating but also prevents me from fully enjoying the game.  
  
If there are any further steps I can take to assist in resolving this issue, or if escalating this case for further review is possible, I would appreciate your assistance.  
  
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you and hope for a reasonable resolution.  
  
Best regards

Dear Ubisoft Support,  
  
Thank you for your prompt response. I understand that there are technical limitations and internal policies in place regarding my request to unlink my Ubisoft account from Steam.  
  
Given that I am experiencing critical technical issues when launching Rainbow Six Siege through Ubisoft Connect (resulting in frequent freezes), I kindly request that my case be escalated to a senior support agent or manager for further review. I have never been able to play the game through Steam on my main account, and resolving this would greatly enhance my experience.  
  
Additionally, if unlinking is not possible due to these limitations, are there any alternative solutions, such as transferring game data or achievements between my Ubisoft accounts, that could help resolve this issue?  
  
I appreciate your time and consideration, and I hope to find a solution that allows me to fully enjoy the game.  
  
Best regards

***Me:*** Dear Ubisoft Support,  
  
Thank you for your continued assistance with my case. I appreciate your efforts to address my concerns regarding the technical issues I am experiencing with Rainbow Six Siege.  
  
I understand the limitations regarding unlinking accounts and the five-strike policy in place. However, I would like to kindly request further assistance in exploring any possible alternatives that could help resolve my situation. I'd like to ask where the five-strike policy is located in the code of conduct. I didn't know there was such a rule in place. I apologize for the behaviour that caused me to receive a strike. I'm only trying to solve the issues present so I can play Rainbow Six Siege without having to worry about my PC crashing.  
  
Given that I have experienced critical freezing issues when launching the game through Ubisoft Connect, I have taken some steps as advised, such as updating my graphics drivers and verifying game files. Unfortunately, these measures have not resolved the problem, and I am still only able to launch the game using the Vulkan desktop icon.  
  
I would greatly appreciate any additional guidance or support you could provide, including:  
  
Suggestions for troubleshooting the freezing issue further.  
Possible solutions for linking my original Ubisoft account to Steam, or any alternative methods to ensure I can fully enjoy the game without interruptions.  
Thank you for your understanding and support. I look forward to your response.

I am not fully aware of the behaviours that may result in strikes, and my goal is to resolve the technical issues I am experiencing with Rainbow Six Siege.

I work in Privacy and am doing some research on what data game companies have about gamers and what they are providing through GDPR.

If you are not familiar with GDPR, it's a few years old law from EU requires companies to disclose data they have about their users and allow users to have access to the data.

Unfortunately, I'm not a hardcore gamer and don't have a long playing history. It would be great if someone from the community would help me with this research. For Ubisoft, we can go to Account Management page, open ""Privacy and Communication"", then select Request a copy from the Download your information section.

I went to the Ubisoft Club app on my Xbox one to see if I could log out of my Xbox account and log into my new ubisoft account to claim my skin and I learned that you could only log out of your Ubisoft club account through the website.

1ba5gjx,prettybird97,1709947760.0,Title: My Frustrating Odyssey with Ubisoft Customer Support: Rainbow Six Siege Missing from Library,2,2,"Hey everyone,

I've been a die-hard Rainbow Six Siege player for years, first on Xbox and then transitioning to PC. However, my recent experience with Ubisoft customer support has left me feeling incredibly frustrated and stuck in a loop.

On February 28th, I encountered a bizarre issue: Rainbow Six Siege disappeared from my game library. It was as if it had vanished into thin air. Considering I've invested countless hours and even purchased the game twice (once for Xbox and again for PC), this was more than just a minor inconvenience. It felt like a slap in the face after all the time and money I've put into the game.

Naturally, I reached out to Ubisoft customer support in hopes of resolving the issue promptly. However, what followed was a series of back-and-forth exchanges with different support staff, each seemingly unaware of the previous conversations and providing no tangible solutions. Despite explaining my situation repeatedly, I've been met with generic responses and no progress towards resolving the issue.

What's particularly frustrating is that due to the age of my initial purchase, there seems to be no record of it in Ubisoft's systems. This lack of documentation has made it incredibly difficult to prove my ownership of the game and get the assistance I need.

At this point, I'm at a loss. I feel like I've hit a brick wall in my attempts to get Rainbow Six Siege back in my library. It's disheartening to think that I may have wasted money on a game that I can no longer access due to technical glitches and unresponsive customer support.

Has anyone else experienced a similar situation with Ubisoft or any other gaming platform? If so, how did you manage to resolve it? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated, as I'm feeling quite defeated at the moment.

Thanks for listening to my rant, and here's hoping for a resolution sooner rather than later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1ba5gjx/title_my_frustrating_odyssey_with_ubisoft/,2024-03-09 09:29:20
kkhicv,UnmatchedGuvenor,1608983835.0,Ubisoft pricing and service,2,1,"So I just had to share this nice little experience with the community.

I stumpled upon a discounted dlc for Division 2 in the Ubisoft Connect app. Only 9,- DKK, which is like 1,2 USD

I added it to my basket, but now it was 67,5 DKK (roughly 11 USD)  
Obviously I contacted support, who seemed to this it wasn't their problem The chat was longer than the picture, but the remaining conversation was just me asking for a promo code for the price difference between the advertised price and the basket-price, or to talk to a manager, both which were declined.

So this is my encouragement to the lot of you, to buy your game via other channels than Ubisoft.

So to keep it shorter, I have been pushing the ball over and over with Ubisoft support and I just want to look at an alternative here, if anyone from the community had the issue and been able to fix it.

The issue in question is quite simple. Got back to Ubi games and I am unable to invite my friends to my games. They just don't receive an invite. Similiar to that - I can't receive any invite from my friends. In Rainbow Six Siege it's not an issue, as you are just able to join manually through the overlay but on For Honor you don't have that. 

We did find ONE small way to go around. If one of my friends instead of using his own PC goes onto Nvidia's streaming service and sends me an invite, I am able to receive it after some spamming with it through the chat. To be honest that's the only way I can be invited, and same goes to my other friend.

I spent past two or three days trying to reach any conclusion with Ubisoft's support. Went through their troubleshooting and stuff like that, wasting my time to set up stable IP adress in my router, forwarding ports for For Honor and other stuff. All I got is that I now know how to forward ports, and also my NAT from Green changed to Red briefly, but came back to green lately. 

Now, third day of talking with them, they want me to contact my ISP because.. Because that's what you do if only one of your apps doesn't allow you to invite your friends, while you don't have any problems with connection on any of your games, including the ones from that platform.

I did try to restart my PC, reinstall the Ubisoft connect, restart my modem and other stuff. Nothing seems to help. I am just trying everything I can at this point, and I hope any one of you had the same problem and managed to sort it out or something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/uu4qqx/an_issue_with_ubisoft_connect_friend_invitations/,2022-05-21 02:42:17

I would love to see a Ubisoft game that pays homage to early The Sims titles for mobile platforms like The Sims: Bustin Out, The Urbz: Sims in the City, and The Sims 2 for Gameboy Advance and Nintendo DS. 

In these games, players create their own character and immerse themselves in an open world environment where they customize their own world, make friends with the in-game characters, make money playing mini games, solve in-game puzzles and obstacles, and manage in-game needs (Energy, Hunger, Hygiene, Fun, and Bladder). 

EA/Maxis doesn’t really make these kinds of Sims games anymore because they are focusing on the The Sims 4/5. 

I think it’s time to finally see a Sims competitor that’s not Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley. Ubisoft would do an amazing job making a Sims world.
