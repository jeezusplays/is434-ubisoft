1ggdvwt,Melodic-Party5293,2024-10-31 20:58:41,Why is modern ubisoft so incompetent ? ,1,0,"Compare their ""next gen AAAA"" games to games from back in the golden era. Compare star wars outlaws AI to to splinter cell chaos theory, or combat in pop warrior within to to combat in any ac games, or the visuals, crowd  parkour, stealth in ac unity with mirage. 

How does it happen? You have already great system that your team has experience with and yet you still decide to develop slop that no one asked for ? 

And the instance where they actually make a great game like Pop: The lost crown, they decided it was time to disband the team because the game didn't hit their sales quota? Instead of improving upon the franchise they just abondoend it? 

Seriously what's going on, are all the people in ubisoft executive level just  a bunch of toddlers ? Or do they deliberately want their company to fail? 

Even though at certain instances I wanna defend their games like ac shadows from unfair criticism from the anti woke crowd, I just loose any motivation knowing that it'll just be another miss. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1ggdvwt/why_is_modern_ubisoft_so_incompetent/,Ubisoft

When I first bought Anno 1800 it asked me to create a new Ubisoft account to bind the key to which I did. After enjoying the game I decided to pick up all four season passes while they were on sale.

Without me knowing, Ubisoft connect had swapped my logged in account to an older one I had used for their games in the past, which then bound all season passes to the account that doesn't own Anno.

Because of how the licensees are split, I can't play the game on either account despite owning the base game and all of it's season passes on steam.

I recently had a problem on my PS5 requiring me to bring it back to the guarantee service for repair. I had confirmation by the phone guy that they'll reset the console system, thus deleting all of my games' save files. I don't have the PS+ so no cloud saving, and no additional stockage system so all of my saves are in the console's original stockage system, which will be reserved.

My problem is, I have a Ubisoft game that I really don't want to lose my save files. Do you know if, by any chance, Ubisoft games are also saved on the Ubisoft profile when played on PS5 ? And that will allow me te restore them.

I’m hoping someone here can help me out or offer some advice. I’d like to link my Steam account to a new Ubisoft account for *Rainbow Six Siege*. I already unlinked it from an old Ubisoft account that I don’t use anymore, but when I try to launch Siege now, it’s asking for an activation CD key.

The thing is, I own Siege on both Steam and my other new Ubisoft account, so I know I have legitimate access on both platforms. I don’t mind if I lose my old progression (even though I spent hours on it); I just want the game linked to the correct Ubisoft account so I can play without any issues.

If it comes down to it, I’m even willing to rebuy the game if that’s necessary—just looking for a legitimate way to resolve this. Has anyone else run into this or have any suggestions?

I did not get a mail (as I was supposed to) about the refund, and since I do not follow gaming media at all was utterly unaware of it.

I made a refund request, and the game was removed from my account, and I was told after 10 to 14 days I would get my money back. After 17 days in total passed I opened a support ticket and ever since I only ever get canned responses.

I set them the legally required second and third timeline for a remidy (I am in Germany where I am sadly required to do this)

And now 29 days later I still am waiting for my money and always get the same canned responses.

They always thank me for my patience and understanding (which I made clear I long lost)

I told them that I will sue them should they not comply and do what they are legally required to do, and they still did not respond.

Well tomorrow I will do just that, the poing being is buyer beware if you ever need a refund Ubisoft might just try to wear you down so they do not have to refund you, stay away if you value your money and your time.

Also as a FYI I will not back down on this I will sue Ubi through all courts if I need to, this post is merly to warn others and also ask.

Has ANYONE gotten their AC Shadows refund or are they collectively witholding it? Because if they do there might be room for a collective lawsuit depending on which country you reside in. We got the legal means in Germany recently to have a ""Sammelklage"" so if anyone else in Germany is affected shoot me a message and I can ask my lawyer later today how to pursue that avenue.

The email account on my Ubisoft on the Xbox is listed as ______@yahoo.com.com (yes it has an extra .com, how that ever got through authentication I'll never understand.) To even ATTEMPT and contact Customer Support you need to log in to an active ubisoft account. Can't log in with a .com.com since that's not a real thing.

I do my best to explain the issue, but the ""Rep"" who responded had their name change EVERY response, and it boiled down to me asking to having ownership of the game transferred to the new email. 

The answer? NO! You can't transfer ownership to an email that has an active Ubisoft Account. So, you need an account to contact customer support, but you can't have an account if you want to transfer ownership from a NONEXISTENT email that has YEARS of your game on it to your actual email.

Alright, screw it. I guess I'll start from scratch with Steam, right? Also no!

1gdf783,SnoozeCoin,2024-10-28 00:42:14,Ideas for Ubisoft's Business Model,0,9,"Ubisoft has lead the industry in innovative and effective ways to maximize revenue streams across the enterprise. In the spirit of that sharp, paradigm-shifting business acumen, I fully believe there's even more they could be doing to deliver on the promise to shareholders. Below are some ideas.

1. Membership subscription fee. The infrastructure is already in place for this. Requiring an account and to always be online is a great start. But why not charge for the Connect account creation and add a monthly subscription charge to keep the account valid? This, of course, would be separate from the cost of any particular Ubisoft game, and the consumer would need to have a valid account to play an Ubisoft game. That's a whole new revenue stream with minimal implementation cost.

2. Charge per sign-in. Building on the above, if you require online connectivity and require a Connect account, why not charge a small fee per sign-in? You can have the system automatically sign out an account once they exit the game, and automatically sign them in when they enter the game. The fee would be very small, but over the entire customer base the profits would quickly add up. This also successfully monetizates *poor connectivity* and localized power issues that previously were bottom-line neutral or adverse.

3. Per hour service charge. Stacking onto the above two ideas, you could charge an time-based rate for playing an Ubisoft game. The units of time, let's say hourly, would start at the opening menu screen at 1. That way, if they play for 1 minute to 59 minutes, that's an hour's charge, and at the 1 hour mark, the second hour is charged.

4. Patch fees. Why not charge for patches? Patches right now are free but they cost money to make. By charging a small price for patches, you can monetize even the bugs. They'd basically sell themselves, because consumers don't want to play a buggy game. They'll gladly pay. This of course would be in addition to the above 3 ideas.

5. Requiring consent to charge. A condition of the Connect subscription should be that Ubisoft is allowed to withdraw funds for services provided without notifying the user. This would significantly reduce initial resistance to these changes because the user won't even know it's happening for the first month.

Just some ideas, Ubisoft. If you're interested in further consultation, DM me to discuss rate!

considering the big trouble around Ubi currently, some less successful releases in the last years and cancelled projects I wonder what kind of game players want from Ubi.

Ubi recently conducted a survey asking players what’s important for them in shooter genre. I would be very interested what came out of it 😊.

What kind of game is it what you are looking for and what are the key aspects for you?

I start 😊:
I would like a great Ghost Recon game with varied and lively open world and impressive, atmospherically and varied campaign and missions with an endgame allowing continuing playing post the campaign.

1gc28be,SoSneeKee,2024-10-26 03:14:57,Ubisoft Support Experience,10,8,"Hello, everyone.  2 years ago, I signed up for a Referral Program for Rainbow Six Siege. If the program were completed, you would be granted an in-game skin.  I completed the program according to all parameters, but never received any reward. The program showed completed on my user.  However, the progression was stuck for multiple of my participants I recruited. No matter how many games we played, the progress bar would not increase. After filing a support case, which was subsequently escalated to an internal team, it was confirmed that the progress tracking was bugged and thus failed to deliver the reward that I earned.  At the time, ubisoft support said there is nothing they could do, as there was no way for them to generate a skin for my account.  I dropped it because I believed that this made sense at the time. Fast forward 2 years to now.  With the inception of Rainbow6 marketplace, players can obtain skins from past events, challenges, etc, so long as they have enough r6 currency to pay for it.  Thus, I opened a new support case in hopes Ubisoft Support could either provide me with the r6 credits necessary to buy the skin, or buy the skin themselves and help transfer it to my account.  Below is a record of my experience with this issue.

After referencing previous cases and once again providing screenshots that the progression tracking was bugged, an Ubi rep escalated my case again.  The result they found was that the tracking was indeed bugged at the time, which is why I never got the skin.  Thus, I explained that this skin is now available on marketplace and requested the allotted amount of credits so I may purchase it at no expense to myself.  For reference, this skin is now worth $700USD+/88k  r6 credits+ due to its rarity.  This is why I cannot just buy it myself. Ubisoft support once again told me there is nothing they could do, which I find hard to believe.  How is a support team that assists with r6 credit issues unable to issue r6 credits? They then said ""sorry about that!"" and closed my case.  Naturally, I reopened the case and asked to speak with someone who COULD help me.  Well, support continued to stonewall me, citing that the rewards program was over by the time I opened a case.  This is true, but their own website says that rewards may take 24hr+ to appear on the account, so how could I have known there was a bug before that 24hr time period?  I pushed this issue with support and continued to reopen the case, but they have now resorted to copying/pasting canned responses and bullying me with the threat of support strikes due to ""inappropriate behavior on this case."" As far as I can tell, the only inappropriate thing I've done here is ask Ubisoft Support to do their jobs. I have meticulously provided every shred of detail and evidence they requested regarding this issue.  I had to bother real-life friends to reinstall this game to help me with this referral program two years ago, then bother them again for screenshots proving it is bugged.  Ubisoft does not seem to care and refuses to provide me with a fake, in-game currency to resolve this issue.  It is a very simple solution in my eyes, but they claim there is nothing anyone at the company can do.

I have played this game since day 1 early access, with 9 years of purchase history illustrating my support of this game. My intention is not to generate malice towards Ubi Support, it is to give you some insight on what the ubisoft support experience is like: ""Yes we see proof of the issue, yes the issue was our fault, no we will not do anything about it whatsoever. Sorry you are out $700+, just let it slide this time, okay?"" I have included my entire correspondence with support regarding this matter so you may independently decide who is at fault here.  Please do not harass ubi representatives below.  I have censored the individual rep names to prevent this. It is extremely frustrating that they cannot facilitate such a simple request. I just want the damn skin that I earned.

After searching thru google, I saw some post saying that Ubisoft would delete the account after inactivity, 

So alright, I tried the same email address the one I used to purchase the games, the same email address that has been use to receive email and receipt from ubisoft themselves, to create a new account,

  
AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW, it shows that the said email has never been in use, I created a new account using that same email address without any issues

* I only have one Ubi PC account, I don't use consoles, there's only one email and that's the one Steam tries to use. 
* It worked fine yesterday, today it barfs. 
* It's not shown on the Ubi account at all but does in Steam and Steam shows I played it 80min for 1st time. 

I've had Blood Dragon on my Steam account since 2014 and yesterday finally decided to try it, since it came up on retro shooter discussion. Had to check steam guide on how to stop it from freezing trying to connecto to defunct servers and after that, it started to work fine and I had some good retro shooting time. 

Today, same steam account, no go, we can't authenticate you. Some other games are on the ubi account but not this one.

If start ubi connect from Steam, it doesn't show the store button, I don't know if that's significant.

Obviously, Ubisoft has really gone downhill (and they have been for a number of years at this point) in terms of the games they are releasing and the way us gamers are reacting to how they are conducting themselves, but does anybody else, apart from me, feel kinda sad about it? Not necessarily about the company in general but their fall from grace?

I for one actually got really emotional the other night when I added an ac2 mod into opera gx, and it started playing “Dreams of Venice”. It took me back to my youth when I was absolutely obsessed with assassins creed, as were all of my friends many I still chat to today and I got really teary eyed. It made me remember the good days, when assassins creed was fighting the big games like CoD and every new release felt fresh and exciting. 

Maybe it’s just my nostalgia goggles, but I don’t really want a world where Ubisoft stop making games. With the delay of Shadows it really had me thinking that in a few years, a staple of my childhood could no longer be around.

1g7wghy,charlieratgod,2024-10-20 19:20:23,Why is the voice acting and how its being put together so awful in Ubisoft games?,10,22,"This is not an attempt to be toxic or anything like that. I am genuinely curious what is off about voice acting and how it all is being put together in majority of Ubisoft-games.

They are first of all for most of the times extremely stereotypical and just.. soft.
Adrien Brody’s character in Peaky Blinders is EXACTLY what Ubisoft is doing with their characters. 
”Oh, cheesy italian gangster? Just make him sound like Don Corleone with some random calm and crazy eyes batshit crazy moments. That’ll do just fine”

There is no imagination whatsoever.

And now the biggest issue I have with the production of these games that could be so much more, so much better.

All the dialogue in these games sounds exactly like what it is. It’s voice lines being put together in a certain order. There is no natural feeling to conversations, at all. It’s literally just ”Play track A - B  and C”
They make dialogue sound like these prank calls with a soundboard. It’s just so extremely poorly executed.

Why do they keep doing this? 
Where is the pride in production?

I know there’s a lot of games that suffer from this, made by different studios but.. Ubisoft stand out. They’re truly in a league of their own when it comes to horrendous voice acting (mostly direction i guess) and dialogues. It’s just.. not good. All the games could be so much better if they just put some passion and love into this part of the production. It just feels.. bad. 🤷‍♀️😔

Again. Many good, solid games, but this just.. bothers me so much.

I had not touched it since then until a week ago. However, when I try to launch it, Ubisoft connect tells me that they can't authenticate ownership of the game. 

Now, after reading countless support articles and other reddit posts about how Ubisoft accounts work, I think I know what happened. The email that I use for my current Ubisoft account used to be used for another account that I had made on my PC. The Ubisoft account I use now is one that I started on Xbox and have all my games on. Sometime after my purchase of Ghost Recon, I linked my current email, AKA the email that is attached to the PC Ubisoft account, to my original account with all my games. I did this so when I would play Siege on PC I would have all my operators and cosmetics that I purchased in my time on Xbox.

So, after providing Ubisoft support with my steam information, my purchase history, launcher logs, everything they asked for, they say they cannot do anything. Why? There's no way they are, in essence, telling me to go F myself and have a paperweight in my steam library, right? If anyone knows of an alternate way to either get access to my game or at least get a refund, your help would be greatly appreciated.

1g76k2q,ToVAidk,2024-10-19 19:09:44,I like Ubisoft,2,38,"Ubisoft gets a shit ton of hate. Their third party launcher sucks and they use some monetisation tactics that nobody wants to see. It's fair to say they're not always great.

Despite that, a large chunk of my favorite games are made by Ubisoft. In fact, a very disproportionate amount. For almost every game publisher who's games I have in my library there's about 2 to 0 games I actually like from them. There's upwards of 10 games I like made by Ubisoft, and a couple I love. In fact, the game I've played the most is from Ubisoft.

I've also really never felt like I had to buy in-game purchases to enjoy the games. They're always just extras.

When they make mistakes, they often try to fix them. Ghost Recon Breakpoint is a great example. But they've also changed the parkour in Mirage after a mod that made it better came out. And they've said they want to improve the stealth in Star Wars Outlaws, after it received a lot of critique.

Nobody, and I mean nobody, makes worlds like Ubisoft does. Their scale, beauty and attention to detail is unmatched. And they are exceptionally consistent in the quality of their worlds, music and writing (mostly).

I'm not posting this to change anyone's mind. Just to balance out the negativity a bit. To me it's clear that the games Ubisoft makes can only be made by passionate people who want to make a fun, immersive game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1g76k2q/i_like_ubisoft/,Ubisoft

Prince of Persia: Sands of Time

I remember this game like I just played it a week ago.. when it's been nearing 20yrs. Man, that's long.

I remember being stuck in (and still loving) that one mission where you jump from pillar to pillar, slide down the last, parkour jump back and forth up the wall, grabbing that dagger... and that cutscene.... that GLORIOUS cutscene. 

I felt so excited and relieved having possession of that dagger when I was a kid. It felt like I knew what it meant to him having finally found it.

And that woman. THAT woman. We all know. My favourite part was when she yanked him towards her outta nowhere completely hidden.

It is supposed to come with two expansion packs. I am wondering if when the game releases, will Ubisoft still honor the two expansion packs promised? The value was $109.99. I know for regular pre-orders they seemingly cancelled them and will include the first expansion with the standard game, though the Gold Edition came with two expansions. 

This is what the promo claims:



Gold Edition Features:



\* Assassin's Creed® Shadows Base game

\* Pre-order bonus: Receive the Assassin's Creed Shadows bonus quest, Thrown to the Dogs.

\* 3 days Early Access: Play the game up to 3 days before the official launch date. 

\* Season Pass: Includes a bonus quest on day one with additional unlockable content as well as two upcoming expansions.



Seems like they discontinued all current pre-orders and the Gold Edition is no more, so is there any word on what they will replace the Gold Edition with and what it will include?

I have played this game on PC a little bit a few years ago and finally decided to start it again and complete it ! (note: it used to work fine !).

Now it just won't launch!

Well, it kind of launches, but then silently closes itself. I am using the UBI Connect launcher. The games starts with a couple of pop-ups, and then nothing. The game never really starts (never reaches the Ubi logo). after a few seconds the ""Play"" button appears available again in the Ubi connect app, and the game is ready for launching yet another time. There is no trace of the game in the task manager. I think the last thing it does before allegedly closing itself  (hard to tell because it goes by real fast) is synchronizing save games and trophies.

I have tried removing save games & trophies from the computer + deactivate cloud sync +disconnecting the network, as I have assumed and read (on other threads a few years old) that corrupted saves could be the issue. None of this worked.

I have tried a fresh install of the game on a (very) different computer. Same symptoms. I just get a few pop ups and hen nothing.

Any idea what is going on?

This action stems from their frustration over Ubisoft’s new return-to-office policy, which mandates employees to be in the office at least three days a week. The French video game workers' union, Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV), is calling on Ubisoft's French employees to join the strike from October 15 to October 17, 2024.

The strike reflects growing discontent among employees, particularly following Ubisoft’s announcement of a hybrid work model that workers feel imposes unnecessary hardship. This tension comes in the midst of other challenges Ubisoft faces, including poor game performance and management decisions that have already upset employees and parts of the player base.

This protest could be a turning point for Ubisoft as it tries to navigate internal dissatisfaction while tackling broader industry pressures.

I used to be a huge fan of Ubisoft games and stopped buying anything from them around 2017.  
Since the very first AC and Farcry2 down to AC:Odyssey. Recently it got myself thinking ""Why did I lost all interest about Ubisoft AAA games ?""  
  
One word sums it all for me: **Surprise.** Or more accuratly, lack of it.

Everytime Ubisoft makes a new AAA I am almost confident it's going to be an Open World action RPG, with map unlocking by going to ""towers"".  
I used to really like that, spent many hours and they are quite fun game even the new ones I am sure, but I just feel like I played way too much of this gameplay loop to keep buying more of it.

I would expect that from the same IP, but I feel like Farcry, AC, Breakpoint, etc all have the same ""feel"" with a different map and main gameplay mechanic (guns, swords etc). But they all ""feel"" the same imo.

Think of the changes between Farcry 1 (I know Ubi is not the dev), Farcry 2 and Farcry 3. All thoose game were very different and caught me by surprise back then. Farcry 4 and 5 all left more or less a twist on FC3.

To sum up, I am an adult now, and I don't have much free time to play like before, and I don't feel like spending that time playing the ""same game"" (yes, this is an exaggeration of my feeling) over and over.

I don't know if orthers quite old folks have the same feeling as I do.

I believe that the story of Queen Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba would make for an incredible game, with her fight against Portuguese slave traders and defense of her people's independence providing ample opportunity for stealth missions, intense battles, and political intrigue.

As we enter the era of 4K and 8K graphics, I believe that now is the perfect time to bring Queen Nzinga's story to life in a way that is both visually stunning and emotionally impactful. This game could be a testament to the power of resistance and the enduring spirit of the West African people, while also providing an engaging and entertaining gaming experience.

I would love the opportunity to discuss this idea further with your team, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1g32c6k/assassins_creed_based_on_queen_nzinga/,Ubisoft

All we have had for the past 16 or so games is 4 black protagonist ( Aveline doesn't count because she's mixed) adewale, yasuke, bayak and probably Aya. While the rest are of different nationalities how is this right. In terms of diversity this is just sad, and I feel like it will be another 10 years before we ever get another minority representation in assassin's Creed. Sure Ubisoft has got the ball rolling with yasuke, but they shouldn't stop there. 

For something like assassin's Creed hexe, a female black protagonist really fits because they can tie it with the slavery angle, ( female protagonist came from slavery and her or parents escaped) this would give the charecter motivation to do what they need to do in the game, and give them a motive people sympathize with, And a goal. What's frustrating is that if they don't change the female protagonist, Young black women wanting to pick up this game won't feel represented. That's all I'm going to say.

Or was it a gradual decline?,29,107,"I’ve been a fan of Ubisoft for years, but it’s clear something went very wrong along the way. I’m curious, when exactly did Ubisoft fall off for you? Was it gradual or did they jump the shark at one particular moment?

For me, Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag was their last true high point. The naval combat was fantastic, and it felt like they had so much potential. But look at what they’ve turned out recently. Star Wars Outlaws is embarrassingly mediocre for a franchise with limitless possibilities, and Skull and Bones is just a shadow of what Black Flag achieved years ago. It’s like they completely lost sight of what made their games special.

Maybe it was with Assassin’s Creed Unity and its buggy launch, or was the writing was on the wall with the Watch Dogs series not quite delivering on its promises?

The way I see it, the rot has fully set in at Ubisoft, and honestly, I don’t see them recovering anytime soon. Unless some Elon Musk-type figure steps in, fires the execs and all these managers obsessed with squeezing every last penny out of us with microtransactions, and brings in developers who actually love making games, not just monetising them, it’s hard to see a way out. The culture need to be completely overhauled.

When exactly did their priorities shifted entirely to cranking out cookie-cutter open-world games and pushing live-service models, instead of focusing on creativity and gameplay innovation?

Do they have any chance of turning it around, or are they too far gone at this point? Can Ubisoft can be saved?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fytvun/when_did_ubisoft_fall_off_a_cliff_or_was_it_a/,Ubisoft

Division only has 2 games and honestly we have the most stable online community in the games in my opinion. Then Heartlands got canceled. And now we're waiting on 3. Still. Far Cry and Assassins Creed fall ill to the same things. ""We"" didn't want level systems and ""looter shooters"". And the story got stale and gameplay repetitive.  Far Cry plots starting at 3: Pirates vs Natives and MC, Dictatorship vs rebels, Cult vs rebels, Dictatorship vs rebels. Ghost Recon Breakpoint came in 2019. It's a great game except it feels repetitive but still fun. I don't know, it feels like Assassins Creed isn't even Assassins Creed anymore. Ghost Recon and Div are barely holding on it seems like.

RDA getting AMP's and other vehicles Na'Vi getting Wildlife and Buffs from fruits or hunting animals

1fx78t6,Raidenski,2024-10-06 11:08:52,Ubisoft Is Reportedly Planning To Release 10 Assassin's Creed Games In Five Years,139,205,"When the news broke out that Assassin's Creed: Shadows was being delayed, it was met with mixed reactions. Personally, I see it as a good thing, as it gives the development team more time to iron out the bugs that are too often found in Ubisoft releases; it seems that Vaas Montenegro sat down with the executives and told them the definition of insanity... Or so I thought. 

Now it appears that Ubisoft is planning on speed running Assassin's Creed fatigue; instead of taking 5 years to develop one game, they're gonna be releasing 10 AC games in 5 years. 

Despite Assassin's Creed probably being my favorite videogame franchise ever since the first game, and having played every mainline AC game up until Odyssey, and having Valhalla in my library, I decided to take a break, as I had spent over 200+ hours playing Odyssey, and despite thoroughly enjoying the totality of the game and its various DLC's, it was exhausting enough that I haven't even gotten off the island of Kephallonia in New Game+. Ironically/coincidentally, I'm currently playing The Division; another Ubisoft title. 

As much as I love the franchise, I don't see how over-milking the AC franchise is a good idea. Each of the Assassin's Creed games have faltered in several facets that could have been improved had they stayed in development for a little while longer, but Ubisoft seems perfectly content with ""good enough""... Now their future as a videogame publisher is uncertain, with talks of a buyout by another multimedia conglomerate.  

Could this be the final nail on the coffin for Ubisoft, or could this actually be what it takes to regain their foothold as an industry giant and reclaim their status as a beloved videogame publisher? I think at this point, nothing Ubisoft does will sway some gamers who are dead set in their disdain for the company, but what do y'all think about Ubisoft's plans to release 10 Assassin's Creed games in the span of 5 years?

1. Restarting assassin’s creed. In my opinion I just feel like Ubisoft has done massive damage to the franchise.

What I would do with assassins creed:
Assassin’s creed shadows will still release but be the end of the old assassin’s creed.
Assassin’s creed Hexe will not be canceled, but won’t be developed until later on. 

2. Rebuilding the team of watch dogs. 
I think it was dumb for Ubisoft to collapse the team, and for this watch dogs it will be like the 1 and 2 but still have some ideas from legions.

3. Make rainbow six siege better, by readding the features the fans loved but Ubisoft (mistakenly) took away.

4. Focus more on remakes and prince of Persia. I honesty really like remakes (remasters are dumb) and Ubisoft has loads of iconic games from the 2000s that I think NEED a remake. For prince of Persia the 2d side scroller (like the lost crown) will be getting future sequels with the same protagonist. The old prince of Persia games will be remade and future third person prince of Persia games will be developed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fwek06/what_i_would_do_if_i_was_in_charge_of_ubisoft/,Ubisoft

They've got so many classic/beloved franchises, yet recent decisions or iterations haven’t really lived up to expectations, if there is even one at all. So, curiously, I wanted to hear from you all—what would you like to see in Ubisoft's future games?

For me personally, I'd love

* A Singleplayer / Multiplayer pirate game that plays exactly like Black Flag but more pirates less assassins 
* A better Assassin's Creed (Use AC Unity parkour as blueprint, combat with multiple counters, RPG system with health sponge enemies are optional, and I'm not even talking about the Yasuke controversy that divides fans)
* New Rainbow Six (back to squad/coop mechanics and not PvP hero shooter)
* New Splinter Cell game (stealth mechanics powered by Real Time Ray Tracing, Michael Ironside is back)
* Prince of Persia (remake)
* Ghost Recon (open world can take a backseat but I must admit, Wildlands is decent)
* Far Cry game (with better attention to detail mechanics like in Far Cry 2 but no Malaria, Story is as good as Far Cry 3, but also taking in new shenanigans from later titles)
* New franchises that aren't woke, live service-first, and filled with microtransactions

I haven't touched a Ubisoft game since their bad launcher basically prevented me from playing For Honor after I played it, and their support never helped me no matter how many times tried asking for help, no matter how many solutions I tried. It sucked because, beyond wasting 40 euros on this, I really liked For Honor. Now hearing about this whole affair, it's giving me hope that I could play For Honor again, I would even be ready to buy it again, on the codition that I never get to use Uplay or whatever it's called now.

In light of their recent troubles, I imagine, I've seen that Ubisoft put many of their games on Steam, and heard that apparently they're slowly dropping Uplay (stopping updates, just maintaining it) **Does that mean if I buy a Ubi game on Steam, I will be able to start the game from there, or will I still need the Ubisoft launcher to play these games?**

**EDIT:** Apparently Uplay is the old launcher and is irrelevant. Now it's ""Connect"" and another one? **The question still stands.** Would I still need to relay on a Ubisoft Launcher, no matter its name, to play a Ubisoft game?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1ftljel/apparently_ubisoft_is_slowly_dropping_uplay_do_i/,Ubisoft

I will be brief.

I know Ubisoft Connect that gives ""Units"".

I search the page on the site where we can see the games to buy rewards with them.

I am on console where the application only shows the recent ones that we have played. 

So I search to see where we can ""buy"" any rewards from Ubisoft games.

I know it was possible, because I acquired some for Valhalla beforehand.

1ft1t9t,Shadowsnake30,2024-10-01 01:49:50,Ubisoft what happened?,0,51,"Let me start with Ubisoft being one of the best game developers. Ubisoft had made games that were critically acclaimed. Their major hit that had put them on the map was the first Assassin's Creed. Sure, it is dated now with its janky controls which not a lot of people would be able to tolerate the gameplay. Regardless, if you had played their games in the past or present there is a significant difference now. 

If we look back on their old games they had a soul that makes you excited or curious what is about and what's new. They had this influence or charisma that you want to play their games as they are big open world that are beautiful to explore. Tons of things to do making it feel you bought a great game with tons of content. For me, the most exciting is when your assassin leaps with eagle sound effect that made me want to keep doing it. It was unbelievable for me able to see something and I go that far and that high. I used to think Ubisoft can or will surpass Rockstar someday. They had open world, stealth (Favorite genre), story telling (I am a sucker for Victorian settings), and many more. Ubisoft was one of the most popular and anticipated publisher to watch for as they kept releasing games.

Then, the noticeable drop in quality started to become noticeable. We had games that are buggy at release which most fans including myself was forgiving. I kept buying no matter what others says as I am not a fan of critics' reviews. I am more let me play the game, as that is the purpose of my console to played and used. I was beginning to predict what am I supposed to do on the quests which is ok until, it wasnt fun anymore that felt like a chore to play their games. So, I began to replay their older games and why did I felt that way and began to see the formulaic way of their games now. Keep going to camps to camps or towers to clear them with infinite respawns. That was no longer exciting to do as I felt I was working the game with so many ads enticing you to buy this and that. 

The beginning of their fall/hate was all over the gamer community. My friends began to tell me how unfair they were to the original creator of the Assassin's Creed which I gave them a benefit of the doubt. As that may seem unfair until we hear the side of Ubisoft themselves. My friends were no longer as excited as I do to pre-order their games and I did began to notice the more expensive versions of their games. This was the time I began to play more other games with my friends that gave me this experience that I lost with the Ubisoft games. I faltered on buying their games at release at this point. At times, I forget that they even had a game releasing.

Then, I had this crave of playing Ubisoft games as not too many interesting games I see even I bought them I never felt playing them. I played Far Cry 6, AC Valhalla, AC Mirage, Watchdogs Legion, Ghost Recon Breakpoint and Division 2. That was a mix of experience for me but, I did have fun for a little bit. Finally, I did my research why their games are no longer as they used to. They lack the flare and new innovation. They kept using the using the same thing if it becomes a hit. So, it was so apparent that they are really milking the fans. From different versions of the games price tags, dlcs, experience boosts, NFTS, season pass and subscriptions. That's when it hit me and began to avoid their games as not only they no longer want to make their game different but, to disrespect their fans with the Quadriple AAAA comment on Skull and Bones.

Here where we are now, the AC Shadows trailers being released I was excited as I wanted to be a ninja. I was hopeful that they will make this one better which I think it is. Then you get a trailer of Yasuke with a rap music. I wasnt upset myself but, I knew it would be a problem as you already made it clear on Far Cry 6 that you are into DEI or woke to some. Now, that chaos they created and refused to listen to their fans had consequences their stocks fell and even their investors are no longer interested. They had to conduct an internal investigation. To make things a little worse you have these new leaked operators for Rainbo Six. Will the game AC Shadows do well? Who knows what it may end up same with Ubisoft. Their leadership needs to change as I feel like it's the same thing what happened to Blizzard when the original ones left everything fell apart.

To conclude everything. I just wish for them to recover and continue to make games as they have the tools and my god their worlds are always beautiful to see but, if you dont listen to fans you will continue to fall. They have many talents that would be jobless as they do have the potential to make another banger of game. I am a gamer and collector I collect games on all platforms and buys the same game just because it has different artwork and different versions of consoles even I have 6 PCs. I dont listen to critics as some are afraid to be honest as they wont be invited to review their games again. I do my own judgement as hearing someone reviews a game without me having it on my shelf as a collector feels weird. TLDR I know. Make the Splinter Cell game!

I've played unity, syndicate, origins, Odyssey and Valhalla. Origins being my favorite in the recent Ancient civilization games.

Also played all the watch dogs games. But I can't keep playing Ubisoft games anymore.

Even with heavy discount, they feel like such a chore with the insane grinding. Valhalla broke me, so much grinding and so boring. At one point I stopped having fun and I gave up on the game, WD legion too felt so stale and not fun to play, I finished it but I'll never play it again. WD 2 was so fun.

Now it just feels like Ubisoft is pumping out games just to reach a certain financial goal. They stopped innovating the gameplay and now every single IP feels like same game with a different coat of paint.

Every game has the same stealth mechanic. Every game is monetized our of the ass. Even for AC which is now primarily a RPG series. The fun of RPG is not even present properly, in an RPG I want to feel immersed with various different branches, endings, ways to play which incentives multiple play throughs but after finishing an AC game I feel drained and don't want to play it again. It doesn't give me any reason for me to play again.

Where as CDPR even cyberpunk, I would play again, with different endings, different builds, different relationships. At the very least because the gameplay loop is engaging, I don't have to grind for hours. Same for the witcher, even though they are 2 different IPs and both being RPGs, they are different experiences. The DLC expands and innovates on the base game too.

Sucker Punch has very diverse IPs from Sly cooper which is a platformer stealth to infamous which is a pure open world power fantasy to the Ghost series.

In conclusion, I'm done with Ubisoft now until I see a actual effort to innovate in their games.

P.S. Imo since Origins came out, the AAA games quality bar has reached so high to where Ubisoft simply can't compete anymore. We have bangers every year like elden ring, God of War, Baldur's Gate, RDR 2, Alan Wake and all these games take time to cook, meanwhile Ubisoft out here pumping out new AC games on a pretty much yearly basis with same old formula like a making new iPhones with minimal new upgrades borrowed from other games but doesn't improve on it and I don't think Ubisoft understands why the games I mentioned and the features they borrow from other games were actually so popular and hits with the gamers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fscd1h/after_years_of_playing_ubisoft_games_i_gave_up_on/,Ubisoft

1fs9fvm,noswag15,2024-09-30 01:16:21,Things that are not being talked enough about ubisoft's anti-consumer practices ? ,6,20,"I am a bit concerned about how this whole ubisoft fallout is going to play out. Not because I don’t think they deserve it which they absolutely do, but because the online discourse seems to be heavily focused on a few specific mistakes that they’ve been making. And while the things that are being talked about are things that need to be talked about, I am barely seeing any mention of issues like single player games requiring internet to play, the requirement to have a dedicated launcher that gets in the way of playing a game that I own in every possible way, the aggressive and borderline illegal pushing of stuff that requires gamers to spend more money to do even basic things on games that they’ve bought and already fully paid for, their employees asking gamers to be comfortable not owning games to name just a few.

I feel like ubisoft is finally waking up and starting to think about making amends but when no one talks about these deep rooted issues, I feel like the company is going to get the wrong (or insufficient) feedback/message and continue to fail. If I am being honest, I want them to succeed because they make some of my most favourite games but the way they’re doing it is clearly not working.

So I wanted to highlight a few things that \*personally\* irk me. I am sure there are more and some of the issues may not resonate with some and that’s fine. So in no particular order, these are the things that bother \*me\* (and I’m sure several other gamers).

Why does ubisoft lump every gamer into one category and treat us all like shit ? I get it Ubi, you’re a business and you need to make money and when you see people illegally acquiring your products, it might be disheartening so if you want to take measures to prevent or reduce that, by all means go ahead and do it, but can you please not make is so annoying that you end up discouraging people who actually want to buy and play the games ?

When I buy a single player game, I just want it to be installed on my machine and clicking on it should take me straight to the game. Why should I wait for the clunky and ugly launcher to show up an ugly black empty store page and have to stare at it till whatever checks need to be performed and then wait so long till I can actually get to the game’s menu. And especially when there’s an update to either the game or the launcher, I now have to wait even more and click yes to a bunch of UAC prompts and once everything is done, it forgets my login and I have to login every single time. I just want to play my single player game on my gaming handheld device but no .. I have to fumble with entering a long 20 character mix of numbers symbols and hieroglyphs on a tiny virtual keyboard to even get to the next stage. I could install password managers (which I obviously don’t want to on a gaming handheld) to make it easier but I still need to copy and paste the password.

Why can’t I just play the game offline? If a check needs to be performed, do it on some schedule and clearly show when the last check was done and how much longer I have before the next check locks me out. Give options for me to extend the verification by performing an adhoc check so that I can briefly connect to the internet during my travels and “top-up” my access. There are ways to implement validation checks while still maintaining good user experience for legitimate users but it saddens me that the company’s knee-jerk reaction is to implement aggressive checks at the cost of UX for the honestly majority of users. The verification checks themselves .. why do they have to be tied to ubisoft launcher at all ? Why not have a separate lightweight headless process that performs the checks in the background when the game is loading before the menu is shown ? Surely a company as large as ubisoft can figure out a way, right ?

Why is there no update on issues that plague existing games ? Does there have to be million games released in quick succession before the previous ones are even done ? I bought avatar frontiers of pandora and while the reception has generally been lukewarm, I absolutely had a blast playing and sunk around 100 hours in it. \*had\* being the keyword here because the game has suddenly stopped working and asks me to purchase the skybreaker DLC to even play the base game that I’ve already paid for. How is this even legal ? I wanted to give ubisoft the benefit of doubt and thought that this is probably a recently introduced bug that will quickly be patched but no .. looks like this issue is widespread and has been open for months and ubisoft knows about it but still there is no information about when or if it will ever be resolved.

Which brings me to the whole “forced updates” and lack of options to delay or deny updates. Games are software and software will have bugs no matter how well it’s implemented or tested but the audacity of ubisoft to think that they’re infallible, that their servers will never go down and that they will never have bugs when the reality is exactly the opposite is a clear indicator of some evil force within the company that’s acting against well meaning stakeholders. Because there’s no way that actual developers who slog day and night to create these games don’t know about these limitations and the gamers also know these because they face these routinely. So it looks like ubisoft’s management is absolutely out of touch and is in the middle of this whole mess because it’s pretty clear that the management made decisions to rush out unfinished products. Even worse is the complete silence and the way the company just shrugs it off as business as usual. No wonder people don’t trust ubisoft. Something drastically needs to change in order to win back the lost trust.

Why do I HAVE to login to a ubisoft account to play assassins creed on a playstation 5 ? It slowly crept in. First it was not required at all. Then an option to login was added but was not mandatory. Then with Valhalla, it suddenly became mandatory to login to a ubisoft account in order to play a game that I bought on playstation ? Why ? It got so annoying that eventually I caved and logged in, only to have a severely degraded experience. The game which was buttery smooth before on PS5 started to have micro stutters every now and then. Not to mention all the useless avenge quests bugging out and constantly bombarding the screen with crap like “XYZ has been slain. Avenge their death” or something along those lines. More filler padding on an already padded game just doing the same thing over and over again. It got to a point that I couldn’t do a single action in the game without the same “avenge” notification popping up with an annoyingly loud sound (I am talking like a notification every second type frequent). I dropped the game right there and never looked back. Why do I not have an option to say “no” to the forced login ? why can’t I just peacefully play the game (which I paid a premium for) in peace ?

Engage with the users more actively please ? Don’t treat users as cash cows to milk till death, eh ? Why not have an honest conversation like a reddit AMA or some channel that the company is comfortable with and take criticism constructively instead of gaslighting everyone ? Sure, there are always going to be people who take it too far with their criticism but the solution is not to assume everyone is like that and turn a blind eye. In fact, there’s so much backlash because there are so many problems and while some people may not know how to voice them properly, it’s absolutely important to listen to the ones that are willing to have a discussion and willing to provide feedback ? Why not be transparent when issues are reported by acknowledging them and giving routine status updates instead of leaving users hanging ? Isn’t that basic courtesy to show to people who have trusted the company enough to spend their time and money in ?

Do better Ubisoft.

1frjbm5,zaza991988,2024-09-29 01:22:59,Ubisoft make me sad,69,93,"The obligatory thing to say is that I am not a hater, and I own so many Ubisoft games from their major franchise (AC, Ghost Recon, Far Cry, watchdogs, Prince of Persia, The Crew, The Division...)

In the last few years, you have noticed a drop in the gameplay quality of their games. I have a tolerance for long games if they are well-made. I truly enjoyed AC: odyssey and considered it as one of my favorite Ubisoft games (AC: odyssey should have been the start of another separate franchise that focuses more on mythology-based RPG and not an assassin game), i liked Ghost Recon Wildlands and Breakpoint (after the patches). I enjoyed Far Cry 6 and the division series.

Ubisoft art direction and environmental artists are truly some of the best in the industry and capable of releasing amazing-looking games that run well year after year. The cities they create feel very authentic.

Ubisoft also has good gameplay systems, from how the weapons feel and perform, to how the combat flows, to the additional tools they give you to take several scenarios. to usually decent progression system that let you feel more powerful at times goes on

The stories they tell aren't bad, but aren't great either, almost every Ubisoft game follows the same formula, a starting locked-off area that teaches you game mechanics, then three (or more) independent separate areas with separate stories and characters that you can take in any order, and then a final confrontation.

If I have to summarize what makes games turn away from Ubisoft games are constant small frustrations that eventually add up to makes the game feels like a chore to play. Let’s give you some examples.

you can take a look at Far Cry 6 with repeated quest design, and removal of leveling up perks instead of sticking them to clothing pieces each scattered on a different part of the map behind puzzles or enemy camps. Or the not-present main villain, or the fact best gear is hidden behind a paywall.

Almost every Ubisoft game's best weapons and abilities are hidden behind a paywall. Their games are built around frustrating/edging you enough to shell out extra in-game monetization for a game that you already paid for. I am here wondering how much extra money are they making in these MTX console/PC games ? 

Every Ubisoft game must have a merchant that doesn’t take the regular currency, but only takes a premium currency that either has to grind for an unreasonably long time with random weekly reward.

Or selling a complete edition or ultimate edition of the game that doesn’t contain all the content, and you expected to fork extra money on that.

Not to mention the online requirements for single-player games, live services for most Ubi games and finally removing content from your library that you paid for.

All these frustrations add up to gamers automatically feeling like they are about to get screwed because Ubisoft has done so repeatedly in the past.

Some Ubisoft games feel off is that in most cases gameplay systems don't work well together.

In LoZ:Botw almost every upgrade is behind a temple puzzle, but these puzzles are diverse enough with a separate theme that allows challenge your problem-solving skills, different combat skills, timing skills, or creativity and the game gives you all the tools to do that early on.  AC: Valhalla obviously tries to copy the idea of a puzzle behind weapon and upgrade but you end up with a badly designed puzzle that is either not properly introduced, or just looking around to find an opening from an angle to shoot a lock so you can enter a door to shoot another lock to get to a lame rewards (ingots). And the best/coolest rewards (weapons/armors) are hidden behind a paywall. What makes matters worse is that you will spend more time than you like just to find the angle from where you want to shoot because of the game's dense geometry and the art style. Or the never-ending skill tree that is filled with +1% damage while (random action)…. It just feels disrespectful of your time. Even Immortal: fenyx rising suffers from a similar puzzle design but to a slightly lesser degree. These games just feel constantly frustrating you so go and buy ingots from the store using real world money

Or stealth section in star wars outlaws where you don’t have any stealth tools and broken line of sight system.

Or shallow characters and repetitive missions in every Ubisoft game that the writers of the game think they are amazing and cool.

And this makes me sad. Most Ubisoft games aren’t bad, they are a company that targets a 7/10 or 8/10 game that hasn’t released anything a real GOTY in the last decade. It feels like maybe if they spend more time polishing the gameplay systems, better writing,  and better quest design they can end up with solid games every time because you can see the potential. Ubisoft feels like the smart kid in highschool class, who is set to do the bare minimum to get a passing grading that you know can ace the exam if they make the effort, but after a long time doing these, you started wondering if that can even recover because of their bad habits. That is why their games always go on sale soon after launch because no one wants to pay the full price for a game they have played before with a different skin on top, especially when you know another one in releasing in few month that will end up a similar experience. The best way to enjoy a Ubisoft game is to take a long break between their franchise and that what I think instinctively we are doing as gamers.

1frdyyz,eldenringer1233,2024-09-28 21:11:03,Assassin's Creed needs to slow down and innovate,19,108,"A lot of people has criticized the latest installment for historical inaccuracies or whatever, but honestly, the main issues that there have been 13 main assassin's creed games.

THIRTEEN!

That's insane, and most of them are so similar, they might as well be just one game with many DLC campaigns.

The first one was novel and interesting - travelling back in time through your genetic memory, doing parkour on top of buildings, sneaking around. They made you actually have fun and feel like an assassin.

As cool as the idea is however, it has been milked so much they need to change the formula.

If instead of trying to release a reskin every year or so, it would be way batter if they take their time and make something more novel and work on it for a longer period of time. If they want their ""Elden Ring moment"" sort of speak, they should put the same amount of time behind a title.

I mean to a new player the sense of novelty might still be there, but for people who have been fans of the franchise for a long time, just changing the time period gets sooo stale.

A company as large and as resourceful as Ubi can surely afford innovative game designers who can come up with something novel that can wow us, right?

I mean if they release something that gives you the same sense of coolness and novelty as the earlier titles, I am sure people would gladly pay the AAA game price and praise the game.

At the top of my head, with the improvements of technology and hardware performance, they could add cooler stuff like fully destructible and/or flammable environments, dynamic settlements that change over time, NPCs and groups of NPCs that you build interpersonal relationships with, even building long-term enemies, advanced damage models where you target parts of their bodies and inflict realistic wounds and injuries, etc. The possibilities are endless.

I subscribed on Aug 26th for the service for the play Star Wars Outlaws (what a fiasco, btw). As usual, I forgot to cancel my subscription and was charged again yesterday, September 26th. Within 5 minutes of being charged, I cancelled my subscription and promptly contacted support to see if I could get a refund. They said no, it's on policy that we don't offer any refund for this kind of service, which is understandable-ish. Even Microfot does it for the game pass subscription. I mean, they should have a time limit to ask for the cancellation (Let's say 12 or 24h). But okay.

I sent them another message saying that they said they would refund me ONLY at that time, and I was glad about it. Honest mistake, honest refund.

Well, today, on Sep 27th, at the same time as yesterday, I was charged AGAIN for the subscription, and I was like, ""WHAT, I cancelled my subscription yesterday"".

I connected with them again under the same ticket number, and they're now refusing to give me the unduly made refund. I didn't authorize that, and my subscription was already cancelled.

I tried several times to ask for their support, and they said they couldn't give me a refund since that was done previously. What kind of joke is that? You charged me without authorization for a service that I cancelled and didn't want to refund me?

Emasculation/Historal bad blood and disrespect.",0,23,"Historical accuracy as term has been co opted by movements who's main objective goal is to dig whistle their racism and hatred of anything Thay seem unsafe . You see it with reactions to minorities in fiction in fantasy settings. Or any any settings essentially. People are also sel selective on when it's applied ,such as new Ghost's of Tsushima game .


The previous game  already had female warriors for example . It's now something being now labeled to have changed .when in reality elements of what's deemed "" changing and revisioning history"" have already existed in that game . It was just deemed acceptable enough or ignored by the player base.

Many times you'll see gamers suggest the games should be historically accurate as very big issue ,when the Truth is most consumers don't really care at the end of day . How many games such a god of war and the like have ever fully perfectly represented the culture they take from However .

Ubisoft has been deemed to have done minimal research on its game of assassins creed . As Japanese users and fact checkers of historical history has pointed out many flaws in its portrayal. Which is true as many thing's are incorrect and speculative inferences. Floor tiles , incorrect usage of family crests and A character being regarded as samurai when historically it's speculation at best.

Ubisoft is in a long list of Western companies misrepresenting cultures .

But its not the only gaming company to do this . Take Capcom and it's pretty infamous history of misrepresenting cultures in its fighting games with some characters not really matching their background . Or games like resident Evil 5 infamously having overt racist elements being portrayed. But both studios fell into this by minimal research.

Gaming companies both east and west both fall into the same trap of not really correctly portraying the cultures they seek to represent. 

Now a element that should be openly addressed as it's been made by users and seems to be worthy of discussion.

The Emasculation of Asian men  across a wider portrayal in media in the west as a trend. Asian men have been disrespected in media by being portrayed as non masculine and subservient to foreigners. It's a trend you'll see spread into how they are regarded . It's a form of orientalism.Movements have risen up to counter this ,due to years of disrespect and Having it  affect personally.

 However like all movements some especially in the west will also end up promoting misogynist views due to those factors seeping into them as movement and also promote bigotry .


 Many users living in the west, and abroad do feel emusculated by a black man Bieng a playable character killing Japanese people as the other playable option is Female . Aswell as making talking points on how assassins creed characters should match there game of origins setting . But as counter point . We're was this energy when afro samurai premiered? Or when many assassins creed games were the mc  Dosent match there games setting? So it's very selective to choose which thing speficcally offends you . Wether it's valid or not .

Another elephant to address is the historical bad bood within asian cultures living in the west with African Americans . The two groups have notably been involved in alot of racist attacks on each other historically. There's very much a real animosity amongst both due to leaving long lasting grievances Especially if violent crimes are involved between African Americans and Asians. This animistosy has been tied to social and economic reasons affecting both communities. 

 So a black character killing Asians was always going to cause some sort of stir .

But again we're was this energy when Japan includes Yasuke as character that does kill Asians such as dynasty warriors. Or reactions towards afro samurai Wich is even more graphic for example.

Another final note to areas is the Nagasaki shrine incitdant . As you know many users feel extremely uncomfortable with the shrine being sold as product. As due to poor research it does match images of destroyed post nuclear strikes. This is undoubtedly a mistake by ubisoft do to failing to research this aspect. 

Japan suffered grievously when it was struck by the bombs . Two cities engulfed instantly in nuclear fire . Historical Japan has always been deeply affected by the bombs . As they were the first people in history to feel the affects of the new weapon of mass destruction. Characters such a Godzilla have arisen to address that fear . And many movements in Japan have risen to promote spreading the message of nuclear weapons and there destruction . 

It also ties into Japan's complex relationshop with the United States . As many feel it's always been something of awkward relationship. The USA does have large presence in how Japan makes its policies and conducts itself . It's very complex issue .

However one thing that should also be addressed is movements in Japan's use of deflection with the nuclear bombs to suppress shame of historical crimes or supress Criticism. Movements have used tie bombs as method to label themselves victims purely innocent on societal level post WW2 . That it was great crime and Japan was simply resting a foreign power . What gets shushed away is Japans Imperial war crimes and expansion of there own colonial history.


Had this Been a thing of past it would be fine . However Japan does walk itself many times into controversies . War shrines in the modern day commerating war criminals. Asking for comfort woman statues to be removed . Or government officials visiting and promoting elements of the unification church with retro nationalism.
 

All these issues have arisen in the wake of new AC as it will serve as historical milestone in how culture of the times will react to a product.In a politically charged time .",https://i.redd.it/uty1fe38fcrd1.png,Ubisoft
1fqjl48,OutlawGaming01,2024-09-27 17:15:29,A Japanese gamer’s perspective on Assassin’s Creed Shadows,518,1440,"Yasuke being a legit samurai has never really been proven. Yeah, he pops up in anime now 'cause it looks cool, but growing up, we never learned about him like that.

If the game's gonna be about a real historical figure, it would've made way more sense to go with someone famous, like Miyamoto Musashi, instead of trying to make Yasuke fit the role—especially since we barely know anything about him.

Making Yasuke, who probably wasn’t even a samurai for real, the face of samurai culture kinda feels like it's taking away from Japan's actual history.

That’s why people are saying the game’s guilty of cultural appropriation. It’s rubbed some Japanese and international fans the wrong way. Honestly, if Ubisoft wanted to include Yasuke, they could’ve just had him alongside a well-known Japanese samurai instead of making him the main guy.


What do other Japanese gamers think about this? 

EDIT.1:

Someone made a very interesting point below:

“Yasuke is our first historical protagonist” -ac shadows most recent “showcase” at 2:58

https://youtu.be/IFnLUfEgjYs?si=qhIsSQjhcSm059Ki


EDIT.2:  A common reply I keep seeing is: (BRUH, its just a game, chill)

Asian hate is real and having grown up in the U.S. (teenage years), I personally experienced many challenges related to it. Over the years, I’ve become more capable of defending myself.

However, when I see a French company create a non-Japanese protagonist in a game who is depicted as significantly taller and stronger than the Japanese characters, it feels like they’re promoting a problematic narrative. It comes off as culturally insensitive and tone-deaf.

Normally, I don’t pay much attention to discussions around DEI in gaming, but in this case, the decision feels particularly misguided and could have been handled with more care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fqjl48/a_japanese_gamers_perspective_on_assassins_creed/,Ubisoft

Any who.  Regarding the assassins creed delay and accompanying shareholder call that was recently held.

""Seeing as how Ubisoft shares are in total freefall and they seem open to player feedback, here are my two cents, especially considering recent comments from the VP about needing more time for 'polish' for assassin's creed.

Ubisoft can't see the forest for the trees.

They are fantastic with launching games that are big, open, graphically impressive, and have lots of things to do (mostly meaningless imo but I often get to a point where side quests become boring, repetitive, and time filling nonsense). You don't need more of this.

What you actually need to do more of is things you're less good, or comfortable doing, you need more strategic depth and layers of gameplay that encourages thought and requires players to actually develop some level of skill.

Enemies and environment challenges should actually feel like they respond to the player and adapt accordingly allowing us to implement our newly developed skills or loot in creative and rewarding ways.

Especially for a game that takes places in feudal Japan which has a rich culture of mastery. From little things like brewing tea, forging a sword, and cutting down an emeny.

There is so much narrative potential to tie to a rewarding and creative system.

So please don't waste time or resources on 'polish'. Please don't give more of the same. Please do something different and interesting!""",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fq36fk/letter_to_the_executives_after_shareholder_call/,Ubisoft

So, if the only way to get something physical is by buying Collector's Edition, then there is no doubt about me that I should be able to choose my PC platform. You get universal code which you activate on special site, and then you can choose your preferable platform. Right now it should be of course Ubisoft Connect, Steam and Epic Games Store. It is so simple and Ubisoft offers this kind of treatment previously for some add-ons, also others publishers offers something familiar sometimes. It would be absolutely great move and everyone, who buys PC version, would be able to get their preferable edition and platform. Furthermore, it's actually so bad that you must buy so expensive edition, and you really don't have a choice and in some situation you'll pay twice if you really want to play on your favorite platform. Also in my opinion it is so much easier to run native Steam games on Steam Deck or Linux in general so it's a no-brainer that the only right way is the choice in this matter.

I was gifted this game in 2020 by a friend of mine through Steam, and I didn’t play it too much back then. Since it was a gift, the game doesn’t show up in my purchase history, but it does appear in the License key activation section on Steam (it shows as giftgame/pass). Among the friends I played with at the time, one had the username ChukChuk (this isn’t the person who gifted me the game, but please remember this name).

Fast forward to 2024, I started playing Rainbow Six again. However, I couldn’t remember my Ubisoft account, and when I tried to play the game via Steam, an error message popped up on Ubisoft’s software saying, ‘error authenticating ownership…’. I reached out to support, and they informed me that this account is linked to an email ‘abcxyz@gmail.com’ (just an example), and they even sent an SMS OTP, but I didn’t recognize the phone number either. Yesterday, they agreed to change the email of that Ubisoft account to mine and sent a link to reset the password.

	1.	The most surprising part is this: after changing the password and logging into the Ubisoft account, I realized that it’s actually the Ubisoft account of my friend Chuk.Chuk. So, is it possible for one Ubisoft account to be linked to two different Steam accounts? Please answer me this.
	2.	I also reached out to my friend Chuk.Chuk and asked them to check their email, but they didn’t receive any notification about someone recovering this account. So my question is, can this situation guarantee the safety and security of other accounts?

I understand that you want to transfer your games.  
  
However, after further investigation, we are unfortunately unable to help you transfer the games due to certain limitations. Please make sure you are logged into the correct Ubisoft account where the game is activated before launching it and there should be no issues accessing it. We hope for your understanding in this matter.  
  
We will now mark this case as closed.  
  
If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please feel free to contact us.  
  
Best regards,

***Me:*** I believe I was approved for the One-Time Exception where I can have my account unlinked and that was going to happen after I provided verification which I did. I'd like that decision overturned or I'd like to know what these ""limitations"" preventing it from happening are. With all due respect launching Siege through Ubisoft Connect completely crashes my PC as I've stated in the first message so I'd like to be able to play on Steam because of your application's instability. Thank you. I look forward to a reasonable response 

***Support:*** Hello ScytheFR

Ubisoft SupportScytheFR, 21 Sep 2024Dear Ubisoft Support,  
  
I hope this message finds you well.  
  
***Me:*** I am respectfully requesting a reconsideration of the decision to deny my request to unlink my Ubisoft account from Steam. As mentioned, I believe I was approved for a one-time exception to unlink the account, and I have already provided the necessary verification for this process. I understand there may be limitations, but I would greatly appreciate further clarification on what specific policies or technical issues are preventing this unlinking.  
  
Additionally, I would like to emphasize the technical difficulties I am experiencing when launching Rainbow Six Siege via Ubisoft Connect, which results in my computer freezing. This issue significantly impacts my gameplay experience, and playing through Steam has been the most stable solution for me. I've never been able to play through Steam on my main account. Therefore, I kindly request a second review of my case or guidance on how I might proceed, as the current situation is not only frustrating but also prevents me from fully enjoying the game.  
  
If there are any further steps I can take to assist in resolving this issue, or if escalating this case for further review is possible, I would appreciate your assistance.  
  
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you and hope for a reasonable resolution.

***Me:*** Subject: Request for Further Review and Escalation – Case #21814309  
  
Dear Ubisoft Support,  
  
Thank you for your prompt response. I understand that there are technical limitations and internal policies in place regarding my request to unlink my Ubisoft account from Steam.  
  
Given that I am experiencing critical technical issues when launching Rainbow Six Siege through Ubisoft Connect (resulting in frequent freezes), I kindly request that my case be escalated to a senior support agent or manager for further review. I have never been able to play the game through Steam on my main account, and resolving this would greatly enhance my experience.  
  
Additionally, if unlinking is not possible due to these limitations, are there any alternative solutions, such as transferring game data or achievements between my Ubisoft accounts, that could help resolve this issue?  
  
I appreciate your time and consideration, and I hope to find a solution that allows me to fully enjoy the game.  
  
Best regards

***Me:*** Dear Ubisoft Support,  
  
Thank you for your continued assistance with my case. I appreciate your efforts to address my concerns regarding the technical issues I am experiencing with Rainbow Six Siege.  
  
I understand the limitations regarding unlinking accounts and the five-strike policy in place. However, I would like to kindly request further assistance in exploring any possible alternatives that could help resolve my situation. I'd like to ask where the five-strike policy is located in the code of conduct. I didn't know there was such a rule in place. I apologize for the behaviour that caused me to receive a strike. I'm only trying to solve the issues present so I can play Rainbow Six Siege without having to worry about my PC crashing.  
  
Given that I have experienced critical freezing issues when launching the game through Ubisoft Connect, I have taken some steps as advised, such as updating my graphics drivers and verifying game files. Unfortunately, these measures have not resolved the problem, and I am still only able to launch the game using the Vulkan desktop icon.  
  
I would greatly appreciate any additional guidance or support you could provide, including:  
  
Suggestions for troubleshooting the freezing issue further.  
Possible solutions for linking my original Ubisoft account to Steam, or any alternative methods to ensure I can fully enjoy the game without interruptions.  
Thank you for your understanding and support. I look forward to your response.

Dear Ubisoft Support,  
  
I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to clarify my previous communication regarding my account. I reached out initially from my main account, ScytheFR, and I am currently trying to unlink my separate account, ScytheGA, from Steam.  
  
I intended to seek assistance without causing any confusion, and I am concerned that responding from ScytheGA might lead to misunderstandings or additional strikes under the five-strike policy. I am not fully aware of the behaviours that may result in strikes, and my goal is to resolve the technical issues I am experiencing with Rainbow Six Siege.  
  
Could you please clarify if responding from a different account may have any consequences? I would appreciate your guidance on how to proceed without jeopardizing my case further.  
  
Thank you for your understanding and assistance.

I logged in to my Ubisoft account via Xbox associated account linking and found my account associated email has been changed to one I have never seen, own, or recognize. (Can provide email address if allowed within rules)

Now to the stupid loop I am caught in. I sent a support ticket in \~5 day ago hoping I could regain control of my account.  Took them 5 days to get around to helping. when they finally reached out the original agent requested proof of ownership via. purchase history. Cool I can do this just follow the instructions and submit the proof. wait about 1 hour for someone to cycle around again. Good News!! ownership has been verified. now all I need to do is send them the email I need it to be changed back to.  Done. Should only be a couple of minutes then I can secure my account with 2FA. 30 min go by... nothing. Refresh the case webpage cause some genius decided live updating a customer support case chat room is too difficult. New message appeared. because I do not have access to the currently associated email (hackers' email) they cannot verify that I own the account and now "" Due to security reasons"" can't change the email. Now we commence a currently 2 hour round and round loop of me explaining that the email currently associated was fraudulently changed by an illegal 3rd party so I don't have access to it, and them saying ""because you can't verify this email, we cannot make changes to the account."" 

  
OH yeah can't forget this gem of a line"" From here, we can only advise that you attempt to regain access to the email address that the account is registered to. If you are able to do this, we will be more than happy to try to assist you further with recovering the account""

1. it's a hackers' email so I can't access it

The game only launches when Ubisoft Connect is offline, which has been made needlessly difficult ever since the redesign.

I've been trying to tell Support for a few days now in an ongoing case, but they just keep suggesting steps they've already suggested before, requesting files and data I've already given them or completely missing what the actual issue is. It's as if they can't even be bothered to read any previous messages.

I understand that the game is already over a decade old (God, I feel old), but it's still being sold, so imo they have a responsibility to keep the game working. But they keep insisting that the problem is with my system and completely ignore the fact that the issue persists on streaming services that are completely unrelated to my system. It's infuriating.

I got them to change my Email address! I answered to their standard response providing further evidence that it is my account. I sent pictures of my account opened with a verification of my name on a piece of paper. I sent them my ip-address (I know not the best idea) and a picture of my id with only the information relevant shown (I know even more risky, but I was desperate). 
Lust but not least, I threatened them to take legal actions if they don't approve my request. After a couple of minutes I got a response, that they approved the request to change my email! 


So my situation is as followed:

I lost access to my E-Mail address used for my Ubisoft account (its a longer story, however i still have access to old E-Mails from the time i still had access). I wrote the support, to change the E-Mail, i gave them multiple proofs that i own this account (multiple keys i used, transaction numbers from games i directly bought from ubisoft, etc.). However, today i got a standard e-mail that all of this does not count and they won't change the e-mail address. 

In the meantime i found an e-mail from the time i activated 2FA with the 6 one-time codes to login, so i manged to get access back (in a way). This might be the reason support denied my request since they saw the account being actively used. 

Now i have access to my account but with reduced security (because i needed to deactivate 2FA) but i still can't change my e-mail address on my own (the link is sent to the old e-mail address). So do you have any ideas what to do now? Write again to the support and hope that this time i don't get a standard rejection e-mail? Live old e-mail and hope that i never have to verify anything with the e-mail?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fl5e3o/lost_access_to_my_email_address_what_to_do_next/,Ubisoft

Update 2: After trying dozens of times over at least a year or two, it is now suddenly working smoothly. I don't know if I did something different or if they fixed something on their end.

Update: Note first and foremost that this is not the solution per se, but a workaround.

The Ubisoft support site takes you to the login screen through the website and tells you to enter your child's date of birth and you will be prompted for the parent email address. That never happened for me. I would always get an error. I followed the instructions probably dozens of times, literally.

Today I decided since my 13-year-old was able to sign up on the Xbox that I would give that a shot. Lo and behold when I entered my 9-year-old's birth date, I was prompted for the parent email address. I was able to finally get his account set up.

So I contacted Ubisoft 4 days ago because when I tried to launch my game library through GFN(GeForce Now) I got a Ubisoft connect DRM authentication error. It took them 56 hours to initially respond, then they bounced through 25 different agents in 9 hours, MADE ME MAKE A NEW EMAIL ACCOUNT, A NEW UBISOFT CONNECT ACOUNT, AUTHENTICATED ONLY ONE OF 6 GAMES I REQUESTED AFTER ASKING FOR THE EXACT SAME PROOF OF PURCHASE PHOTO 9 TIMES(which wasn’t even for the original game I asked for), SEPARATED MY GAME LIBRARY BETWEEN TWO ACCOUNTS, THEN SUPPORT DELETED THE BRAND NEW ACOUNT THEY FORCED ME TO MAKE. 

After all of that they still  failed to resolve issue, and then  they stonewalled me because I suggested at this point I’d probably just end up making a complaint with the FTC(an excellent resource if you have transactional issues with businesses), that I’d possibly speak with someone about getting refunds for my entire catalog through the respective markets, and speak to someone in the Ubisoft legal department, because I’ve spent a considerable amount on my Ubisoft Catalog, and they’ve wasted a lot of my time. Now none of my games work, including newer purchases for the ghost series which were made directly through the Ubisoft connect account I merged with when uplay shut down. 

Oh yeah, did I forget to mention I already dealt with this when Uplay first shut down? Yeah this is round 2 of this service inexplicably messing up. And even more confusingly, all of my games are shown as owned under my main account, including keys, and I played them all only a few months ago the last time I was subscribed to GFN. 

After this 5 day ordeal, I only have thing to say. 
Dear Ubisoft, from the absolute bottom of my heart, you destroyed my love for your games this weekend, and even worse you soured all the nostalgia I used to have.

1fglw54,PixelSaharix,2024-09-14 21:19:58,Is Ubisoft Really Behind the Botting on the Assassin's Creed Shadows Trailer? Let's Consider the Possibilities,0,72,"So, we’ve all seen it by now: the *Assassin's Creed Shadows* trailer and the bot comments. It’s undeniable that there’s some form of bot activity going on. But here’s the thing — why would Ubisoft deliberately make such ***blatantly obvious*** bot posts on their own video? It doesn’t add up.

**Playing devil’s advocate for a second**, let's ask: what if Ubisoft isn’t behind this at all? What if this is the work of a competitor or even just a group of the usual Ubisoft haters trying to create a scandal? With the controversies Ubisoft has faced over the past few years, it wouldn’t be a stretch to assume that certain people or groups who openly declare they want to see them fail, could push negative sentiment and drive their stock prices down further.

If you think about it, Ubisoft has *nothing* to gain from such obvious, poorly executed botting. If they were to engage in this kind of activity, wouldn’t they do it in a way that wasn’t so easily exposed? The outcome here is purely negative. People are calling it out, the backlash is strong, and there’s no way Ubisoft benefits from that kind of attention.

Why would they pay for such low-effort botting that’s bound to backfire? In fact, it only makes things worse. It seems more likely that someone else could be doing this to pile onto Ubisoft's existing issues, making it look like they’re resorting to desperate tactics.

What do you guys think? Could this be a case of someone trying to stir up even more controversy around Ubisoft, or is this really them shooting themselves in the foot?

**TL;DR**: The botting on the trailer is obvious, but it doesn’t make sense for Ubisoft to do this to themselves. Could it be a competitor or haters trying to create another scandal?

**Edit**: To clarify, I'm not saying Ubisoft is perfect — they've made mistakes. But in this case, the botting just seems like too poor an effort for them to be behind it. What are your thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fglw54/is_ubisoft_really_behind_the_botting_on_the/,Ubisoft

From Altaïr to Ezio, and from Connor to Eivor, the journey has been nothing short of amazing. Assassin's Creed has been more than just a game series to me; it’s an immersive experience that I've grown deeply attached to.

If it comes down to that, the possibility of Assassin's Creed being sold off is both a scary and intriguing thought. On one hand, it could mean the end of the series as we know it, but on the other hand, it might also present an opportunity for the franchise to evolve under new leadership.

If it ever comes to that, the big question is: Which game studio would be best suited to take the reins of the Assassin's Creed franchise? I personally think Panache Studio should take charge of AC.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. Which game studio do you think could handle Assassin's Creed the best? And, as a fellow fan, how would you feel about someone else taking over the series?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1ffrwkk/could_ubisoft_go_bankrupt_if_at_worst_case/,Ubisoft

I bought Black Flag a few years ago on Ubisoft Connect store and it worked fine. I tried to revisit it this week on Geforce Now, but it wouldn't launch.

Out of curiosity, I decided to try firing the game back up on my own PC, but the game crashes at ""synchronizing achievements"". I also discovered that you can no longer opt out of the Ubi Connect Beta, and the Beta doesn't have an option to enable ""offline mode"", which some people on YouTube have mentioned is the solution for getting the game to run.

After some tinkering, I figured out how to put the Ubisoft Connect Beta into offline mode. The game now launches, but none of the online stuff works. I tried reaching out to Ubi support to see what's going on, and I'm about 20 messages deep jumping through their hoops of providing system logs and driver updates and pretty much everything under the sun, with no admission that their launcher might be the problem. It's super frustrating, to the point that I'd never recommend another Ubi game to anyone, because if it doesn't work, you are SoL.

Firstly, yes i know i'm an idiot and should have looked closer, but even right now, i'm not sure if this is really a phishing attempt or not, so i'm asking here for opinions. I got an email from [updates@account.ubisoft.com](mailto:updates@account.ubisoft.com) saying someone logged in my account from Brasil. I didn't think much of it, because that account was created by accident when i was a kid and has no games and is not used for anything, but me, being an uneducated dumbass clicked a damn link to activate 2FA. I'm pretty sure it took me to the real ubisoft website, where i logged in and turned 2FAon, but just decided to close my account as it was not in use.

But today i was scrolling trhough reddit and saw a post describing the exact same thing, getting an email, saying the account has been logged in in brasil. I don't believe in coincidences, so i stopped the closure of my account, logged in again, checked the log ins made in that account and yep, no log ins execpt from me when i was closing it.

So, my question is, do you think i just got phished by clicking something in that email ?(wich, again, was incredibly stupid of me ) So far nothing has happened, no login attempts in any other account or anything, and if it matters to something, the email ubisoft sent me to verify my identity when i closed the account was the same email used to sent the ""someone  logged in on your account"".

1fcop2r,rebel761,2024-09-09 20:52:47,Ubisoft Shares Slump After Investor Urges Assassin’s Creed Maker to Go Private,57,72,"Shares of [Ubisoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FR/UBI?mod=ANLink) Entertainment plunged Monday after a minority investor called for the maker of the Assassin’s Creed videogame franchise to go private and install a new management team.

AJ Investments, a hedge fund based in Slovakia that holds less than 1% in Ubisoft, said in a letter to management that it was unsatisfied with the current performance and strategic direction of the company.

Ubisoft has been facing a number of setbacks in recent months. It no longer expects to release “Rainbow Six Mobile” and “The Division Resurgence” in the fiscal year ending in March 2025, saying in July that developers needed extra time to ensure the games meet players’ expectations.

The delays came after the group ceased development of “The Division Heartland,” a decision it made to redeploy resources to bigger releases such as “XDefiant.” Its share price has tumbled more than 50% over the last 12 months. Shares in Paris were down more than 9% on Monday after AJ Investments published its letter to Ubisoft management.

Juraj Krupa, founder and chief executive of AJ Investments, said he wanted the letter to be a wake-up call for other investors. The hedge fund said Ubisoft should go private and urged the founding Guillemot family not to block a sale process. It also called for the installment of a new chief executive willing to weigh the sale of some studios and lay off staff to cut costs.

Ubisoft didn’t respond to a request for comment on the letter.

When they already own two very popular games ""assassins creed and Rainbow six siege, Siege being one of the most competitive games out there. Which i think in a way beats cs:go, because of the intelligent maps and the way you can also attack through walls, roofs and floors, this makes the game never boring. They own the franchise of Tom clancy's Rainbow six siege and making this a video game very good is very smart. This is overlooked by investors as they dont see the potential, ubisoft are putting more effort then ever into this video game and might be the reason they are not coming out with Tons of other games. You can go and watch videoes they make related to the lore of this game
https://youtu.be/4euKsdn8Itg?si=j53iPCJejWRwRoqx
I have always liked the videoes they make relating to this game and they used to have very high definition videoes, now they make more anime looking videos, still good.
The reason i chose to invest in ubisoft is because is the high quality updates they come out with, they keep the game fresh and updated.
I can literally see the quality of the Company in their product which I have consumed countless hours on. Also one of the most popular twitch streamers right now jynxzi which mostly plays Rainbow six. 
This game is fun, competitive and high quality. If they expand on this, hell, i'd even watch a movie, Tom clancys has 2 books which the games are based on surely they could make a movie out of it. They could also remake the franchise splintercell which i wouldn't hasitate that is a must try. So the potential here is huge and im really looking to build up saving in this company while it is cheap as I can see this thing go flying.

The game runs amazingly on the deck, but it’s a shame to see older titles be plagued with dumb crap like this. The Deck has made handheld gaming feel, honestly, amazing!

And no doing it again does not make it ok.   and what about Assassins C how many weeks after the launch date i will have to wait for the prelaunch date  i have already paid for -,0,11,"After 30 years as a customer this latest F up crossed the line last not forget the last time, they try to lunch a game   then it took them 3 weeks to fix a problem, that the clearly knew  about before the launch and like now UBI Also promised all and delivered NOTHING,  But it is one thing having the worst Customer service of any think I've ever subscribed to and i am 50 plus i got my first ubi game in 1998, ,But if you really want to know how much they care about us   just look at their website -YouTube channel all the platforms  Everything and  now after 12 days of Clearly knowing  they lunched and sold a Broken  game.  in their view we must be very Stubit because for them to try to act like all surprised ""oh really does it use 10x the memory a high-end gaming system has"" if they knew haw Stubit it is trying to deny it. Of course, UBI had knowledge of this before they started rolling out the Broken product to us -their customer.    

Those sad attempts from UBI- when they try to claim they knew nothing about this, is actually good for us

By Dening the obvious UBI is actually giving us valuable information.  and i agree, they are of true value   because all those lies and manipulations do for us - is that it exposes the true nature of how ubi sees us what UBI thinks of us **AND YES** this how we look to them -   suckers that have already paid for the service They knew WE never get deliver 

**All UBI has delivered was this small statement regarding a patch we don't even know if it has been installed on our system or not.**

patch release [1.0.0.0](http://1.0.0.0) and that's it - No Dates nothing.  And just think about this even now at this moment **UBI has not mentioned there is a problem with the new product the problem is that the game does not work NO not at all and i don't care what you have heart or read or whatever NO it has not been fixed because today a good friend bought the game, and he is experiencing the same exact problems**

>**Not a single word about this on ANY ubi platforms   Sell selll selll**

So, they know the game does not work but still they lie and manipulate people in to buying a broken product, and the so-called customer service is everything BUT that.  the use of the word ""service"" is an insult to all those proving that.   In my almost honest opium filled opinion   I'm sure the fly circling my droppings does a better job simply because it flies and that's cool.   PS; those living in the EU the **law regarding online purchase is** very clear

I powered my way through it and was able to eventually redeem the code and install the game. I was even able to boot it up and play it. But then Ubi Connect crashed again, and now I am unable to play the game whatsoever, as Ubisoft Connect crashes before the game can boot.

I have tried reinstalling Ubisoft Connect. I tried updating all my drivers, I restarted my PC, I deleted the ""Ubisoft Game Launcher"" folder from AppData as the official Ubisoft support site recommended. I tried reinstalling it on a different drive. Nothing worked.

A few years back before they went BIG with every single game, all their stories were fully mocapped like Watch dogs 1 & 2 - AC Unity-Syndicate- Origins.

All these games had great stories and cutscenes for that, they felt high quality and high budget. Since they’re making bigger open worlds, I get they can’t mocap everything so why not do the following.

Use motion capture in all story/main mission cutscenes as they’re the most important in the game and use in-game cutscenes for side quests and so on (as well as improve the quality of the ingame engine cutscenes)

1f532d2,Habikki,2024-08-31 02:55:20,StarWars: Outlaws Forced to Start a New Game after 1.000.002,0,11,"Posting this as doing so on r/playstation didn't seem right.

I picked up a Gold Edition of SW:O to play a few days early as I had a busy holiday weekend and a not-so busy week leading up to it.  I put my kids down for a sleep on Tuesday, grabed my usual food fest I usually do to nom through a late night play through, game opens, and I'm having a good time.

The next day or two I end up racking up about 10 hours of playtime, not terribly thrilled with the game, but it's solid and know that I haven't been playing the story so that's purely on me.

Receive email from Ubisoft:

    Hello Habikki  
      
    To best experience the Outer Rim, we rolled out a maintenance to make sure everyone is playing the latest version of the game. As one of the players affected who had access to an older version of the game, we are aware you might be encountering some issues after this recent patch. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.  
      
    To solve the issue, please make sure you are playing Version 1.000.002. Here’s how to check your version:  
    
    1. From the game tile, select ""Options"".
    2. Go to ""Information"".
    3. On the Version line, locate the version number.
    
    Once you’ve confirmed you have the latest version, please start a new save to fully enjoy Star Wars Outlaws as our team intended. If you continue on a prior save you will unfortunately face issues and progression blockers.  
      
    Thank you for your understanding and continued support! If you run into any other issues, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Um... how about... no.  You want me to forfit 10 hours of play time that frankly I don't have to replay content that wasn't entirely thrilling the first time around because of.... no reason provided?  I end up sleeping on it  only to receive the next email:

    Hello Habikki
    
    We are following up on the previous email we sent you regarding ""Issues with an outdated version on PlayStation 5"".
    
    We fully acknowledge that asking you to start a new game is not the best experience, especially during the Early Access period, and for that we apologize.
    
    To make your return to the Outer Rim a little more special, we are granting you an in-game Trailblazer trinket as well as 100 Ubisoft Connect Units (to redeem for in-game rewards, for example). We are actively working on adding the Ubisoft Connect Units to your account so you can use these as soon as possible, and you can collect the Trinket from the delivery crate in the back of the Trailblazer once you reach Toshara.
    
    We appreciate your patience, and we hope you enjoy the game. 

Now giving me a trinket and Ubisoft credits is supposed to be... worth it?  I'm an adult, I don't have much time for games like I used to.  10 hours is time I rarely have and time that I'm not going to spend re-doing something that wasn't absolutely amazing.

I've also been in software for years.  Whatever the problem is, I guarantee it can be addressed with an update.  Frankly, this is lazy on Ubisofts part to ask this of players and after years and countless releases that are not ready for release, I'm done with preorders.  And I may be done with Ubisoft all together.  The new IP's may be interesting but not enough to compel me to play (Looking at you here Skull and Bones), and the old IPs have been a dumping ground for doubling down on content I didn't like straying away from what I originally loved (Looking at you Assassin's Creed).

If anyone from Ubisoft monitors this, DM me as I'd love a chat from a professional stance, even under NDA if that's necessary.  But if it wasn't for PSN's ""once you download it, no refunds"" policy I'd have refunded my purchase and never thought again about SW:O.  I can say that I have told a few of my friends of my experience, and at least 5 have decided to pass on playing.

I did enjoy where SW:O was going, but knowing that I'm going to have to forfit my play time with nothing more than ""here's some crap that doesn't matter"", I guess I'll never know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1f532d2/starwars_outlaws_forced_to_start_a_new_game_after/,Ubisoft

1f4b9c3,HopefulDirection3936,2024-08-30 03:32:13,Problem with merging old R6S progress from console to pc on separate Ubi accounts,0,7,"A little backstory:

So I played on console siege (Xbox), from when I originally started the game, all the way until about steel wave, when I switched to pc for the most part, even though I’ll continue to play on console off and on over time. The problem is, is that my console and pc accounts are on separate emails because I made them before cross progression came out. I did have my pc account linked to a separate Xbox account, that I played on for a couple seasons but didn’t have much progress, and have since unlinked that account fully.

My question arises from this:

So even though I should’ve done this sooner, I have made the decision to fully switch to pc siege since I think I am personally a lot better on that platform specifically. The problem is that I would like my console progression merged with my pc account so that all of my progress is on one account.

I opened pc siege on the old Ubisoft account that my Xbox was linked to, and saw all my old cosmetics were on that Ubisoft account. So I unlinked my Xbox account from that Ubisoft account, and linked it to the current one I play pc siege on. I know my progress wasn’t initially going to transfer over, so I reached out to ubi support to help me merge it. After verifying my account details and everything, I was ultimately left with this response (The image attached to this post). 

With this, what could possibly be the reason they couldn’t merge my old console progress with my newer Ubisoft account? 

Here are some reasons I think it might’ve happened;

- Might’ve flagged it as account duping since I opened pc siege on the other Ubisoft account before I unlinked my Xbox account, so maybe it came across as me duping the account onto my newer Ubi account. 

- Maybe since I had a different Xbox account connected to my pc Ubisoft account previously, that I have since had unlinked, there was something suspicious about linking a new Xbox account to it and wanting it merged

Anyone who thinks they can help me with this let me know what you think, and what you think I should do in order to get my old console progress on my pc account. 

Here’s the usernames for the accounts if anyone wants to look them up on r6 tracker for confirmation.

Pc account I use now - WooI.

Old Xbox account - DxrkoTTV

I honestly think Far Cry 4, Primal, and 5 had better AI than just about any Ubi games that have come out since. Yea the rock throwing could be cheesy at times but that was by design.

In these games it feels like the enemies are coordinating and looking roughly where they heard a shot come from or in logical areas after finding a body. Also the animals in primal did some cool things where you would think they forgot about you but then they’d come charging back later. Since then it has felt less hand-crafted and logical and I suspect this is due to map size leading to more heavily relying on broader systems. 


TLDR- make the maps smaller and the AI better and the games will be better received IMO.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1f3px51/ubi_ai_used_to_be_better_when_the_maps_were/,Ubisoft

While I do wish there were more places to explore and a bit of a longer story, I’m pretty satisfied with the game as a whole.

The only negative points atm are some lightning glitches inside the cutscenes and the pre renderes cutscenes look either 12/10 or like 2/10 nothing in between.

So I recently came back to playing PC which I was unable to do for the last 6 months and now I wanted to play Frontiers of Pandora. So far so good. Had to reset passwords cause I forgot my previous one and wrote the new one down and told the Pc to remember my login. 

Did update the game afterwards.

Came to start FOP…. And it crashes. Cloud Sever can’t be synchronized and when I tried skipping that step it didn’t work. Try it again 20 times and it keeps crashing. At this point I’m annoyed. So I checked the installed game data for errors. When that was done, I launched it again. And it crashed …. Because after I started it an add window for the new Assassin‘s Creed game that’s gonna be released in November pops open. I try it again. Same thing happens. I try it another 20 times, disconnect and reconnect from the internet, use a differ WiFi source etc. Any attempt to play offline fails. I am foaming from my mouth. After half an hour the game starts. I play it just fine.

Next day, same shit happens. The program keeps saying that it can’t update cloud data which is weird because I have a stable internet connection. Anyway, after another half an hour of restarting my pc, the internet, uplay and whatever gods approval I need for a bloody game to launch. It does. I play in piece. 

Today, I was logged out of my Ubisoft account. I put in my email and password; it doesn’t start. I put it in another few times, it doesn’t start. I check if I have the right password, which I have because I wrote it down when I resettled it. I can’t login to my account because of a connection error, which again is weird because I have stable WiFi. 

I try to reset my password again. Get the email, reset it, generate a new password and copy it via shortcut…. Or. So. I. Thought. It didn’t copy. I try resetting again. The box that I have to check to verify I am not a robot and therefore attempt to resent my password is now loading for half an hour. I get that this one is on me and my stupidity but the constant crashing has ticked me off a few too many times the past days.

Currently, I have 17/18 achievements in Ubisoft Connect (PC) and I'm 99% sure I unlocked all achievements back in 2020. However, Ubisoft indicates that I haven’t completed this one (I think one of the recent Ubisoft Connect updates blocked this achievement for me, even though it was already completed). I tried killing 100 enemies again, but the achievement still hasn't popped.

Ubisoft Support only suggested verifying the game files and retrying, but it didn’t help (in the end, they mentioned they no longer have access to the team who worked on the game, so they’re unable to assist further). I’ve tried reinstalling the Ubisoft Connect launcher, deleting the Cache/Achievements folder, starting a new game, and then New Game+ (because Helix kills only unlock in NG+). I believe I’ve completed around 500+ kills this way (using Sequence 6 via Chapter Select and checkpoint restarts).

1gddaau,Dippers-,2024-10-27 23:18:20,What do you guys think of Ubisoft making assassin creed game base on Ayutthaya Kingdom,0,11,"Hey Assassin’s Creed fans and, I wanted to share an idea that I think would make an amazing addition to the franchise: setting the next Assassin’s Creed game in Ayutthaya, Thailand. The Ayutthaya Kingdom, which thrived from the 14th to the 18th century, has all the elements that make Assassin’s Creed games so engaging: a rich history, complex politics, and stunning landscapes. Ayutthaya was one of the most prosperous empires in Southeast Asia, with connections to Europe, Japan, China, and India. Its unique mix of cultures created a vibrant society that’s rarely represented in games, making it a perfect setting for players to explore. The kingdom’s ultimate fall after a Burmese invasion in 1767 adds a compelling story backdrop full of political intrigue and battles for power. Imagine uncovering conspiracies within the royal court or preventing hostile forces from taking control. And arrival of Templar and Assassin European traders regularly visited Ayutthaya, bringing goods, weapons, and ideas. This provides a perfect narrative opening for the Assassins and Templars to arrive in Ayutthaya by boat, each trying to gain influence over this strategic kingdom. The Assassins might ally with those seeking to preserve Ayutthaya’s independence, while the Templars work alongside merchants and corrupt officials to control the lucrative trade routes. Players could experience missions that blend espionage, diplomacy, and combat as these two factions vie for control in an unfamiliar land. Ayutthaya’s layout would bring fresh gameplay opportunities. It’s famous for its waterways, bustling markets, and iconic temples, meaning the game could integrate boats and water travel as part of exploration and stealth tactics. Ubisoft could bring Ayutthaya to life with lush jungles, ornate temples, and vibrant cityscapes, adding new ways to navigate and hide in the environment. Many players want more diverse settings in games. We’ve seen the success of games set in non-Western environments, like Ghost of Tsushima. An Assassin’s Creed game in Ayutthaya would bring Southeast Asian history to the forefront, expanding the series’ reach and introducing players to a fascinating culture and time period that hasn’t been explored before.

I've seen a lot of reasons cited why, mainly that the historian flavor that grounds the series would be missing. 

A cool solution would be having the protagonist traveling through time. Hitting different periods of time, from ancient to modern. 

This would also allow Ubisoft to explore time periods they never could make a full game in.

The death of Julius Caesar 
The sacking of Rome
American mob scene of the 20s
Vietnam war
Age of discovery South America/Aztec empire
The Cold War
Scramble for Africa (anglo-zulu wars maybe) 
Lurking the streets of Bosnia on June 28, 1914
Rise of the Mongols 
Alexander the Great's conquests

This being an obvious straight up fictional setting and time period might turn some people off, but to me, I see it as an opportunity to have Ubi’s team really cook up something creative and different in terms of every aspect.

Gameplay, art direction, systems/mechanics, world design, characters & narrative, etc… Could really benefit the series in terms of creativeness, by not having to feel as constrained to specific time periods. Allowing them to really make their own “rules” for that setting.

I’ve always felt like they’re very much trying to avoid eras that are more firearm specific. Despite that cool World War section in Syndicate, they haven’t gotten anywhere near any more “modern” settings. This setting can help circumvent that becoming an inevitability for a little bit longer.

The creed is an afterthought in Bayek's game, he is supposed to have founded the organization but instead gives a last minute speech to a bunch of people we hardly recognize, then sticks a shell on the ground and boom: Assassins 

It's like they actively tried to avoid mentioning the Creed (a reference to the Persian assassins from ""Alamut"" by Vladimir Bartol). 

And for the life of me I can't remember Bayek uttering the line ""Nothing is true, everything is permitted"". 

Ok, so whatever. Odyssey comes out before Origins so there is no mention of them there. Valhalla takes places hundreds of years later, but decides on a Viking main character who encounters the creed. 

Now look, that idea isn't knew. Edward Kenway was a pirate first, and an Assassin second. But at least his story was about buying into the creed. Evior doesn't even care. 

Now we're on the fourth RPG entry, and they STILL don't want us playing as an Assassin. 

Yasuke is a historical figure, we don't expect him to run around with a hidden blade serving the same order as Ezio (even though the game is set shortly after Revelations).

So what is everyone’s feedback based on what we’ve seen from the trailers are dev diaries?

Here are some of my points:

* Naoe’s VA should probably redo some of those lines and work on her delivery. With respect to the actress, her dialogue was pretty flat.
* The parkour animations have some odd magnetism that breaks the fluidity. A lot of the new animations we’ve seen are great, but there were a few, particularly when dealing with slopes, that look off.
* Please give us the option to play exclusively as one character.
* Add animations for Naoe putting out lights/candles.
* Maybe add the option to toggle the hip hop music since that seems to have triggered people (I kinda dug it).
* Let us have the hood up at all times, of course.
* Include some replayability features: New Game +, skipping the tutorial section(s), disabling tutorial HUD prompts, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1g9814n/feedback_for_ubisoft_during_the_delay_of_shadows/,assassinscreed

None of your choices really matter, and none of the decisions you make vary up endings or quests in any interesting ways, and the skill tree builds also don’t matter since you can level up every section depending on how long you want to play. 

So why continue to try and make this Witcher inspired RPG formula if Ubi doesn’t even want to truly commit to the standards of the genre?

1g7mdf2,JinniMaster,2024-10-20 08:08:32,My concerns and ideas on the rumoured AC1 remake.,65,96,"So there's been a lot of buzz about it since the CEO admitted there's multiple remakes being worked on. I personally don't think AC1 needs a remake but I'll happily play it if it's good.

**The non-negotiable:**

1. Atmosphere. Goes without saying one of the most praised aspects of the original is its decrepit, seedy, and conspiratorial presentation. You never quite feel at ease in that game, always like you're peeping into an event you're not supposed to. Right from the beginning with the glitchy intro with Al-Mualim's haunting, distorting words playing as hordes of literally faceless npcs crowd you. It's such a strong opening that confidently establishes what the game will feel like. Ubi HAS to retain this. Don't turn Altair into an action hero, he's a murderer and the game is about a murderous cult.

2. Parkour. Again, almost goes without saying. A lot of hardcore fans are inclined to think AC1 has the most fluid parkour system in all the classic games with the most manual control. The remake has to at the least match this bar. Puppetearing and high/low profile need a return for this to happen.

**Possible improvements**

1. New mission types. It's no secret the repetitive missions really suck the fun out for most people. I think they could fix it in two ways. The obvious one is to replace the generic info gathering missions with bespoke story missions like AC2 did. More interesting, however would be if they kept the structure but adopted more interesting mission types from later ac games. 

A good example would be kidnappings from Syndicate replacing interrogations. Infiltrating into a templar compound with parkour and exfiltrating with the target using social stealth. Or perhaps the dynamic moving eavesdropping from the kenway games. Those always were good tests of social stealth. Lastly it'd be good if they added smaller assassination contracts for Altair. He could gather info on the big 9 from them using the memory corridor. 

2. High crowd density. If a remake is happening it should improve upon the original. We need unity level crowds (without it's nerfed social stealth). An ideal combo would be the mechanics of ezio era social stealth with the density of unity.

3. More environmental parkour options. Since AC1, the series has added a lot of nifty interactable environmental options for parkour. Lanterns for parkour or long jumping, the poles from mirage, lifts, etc. I think these are great and make you pay attention to your environment as you parkour.

**closing thoughts**

These things were largely from the perspective of a casual player, I'm sure the hardcore AC1 fans have a lot to say on it too and would love to hear their thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1g7mdf2/my_concerns_and_ideas_on_the_rumoured_ac1_remake/,assassinscreed

Who were the assailants attacking Ben Franklin in the fragmented Paris memories? They look and act like the gang members associated with the Assassins back in the American colonies, but it doesn’t make sense because the American Assassins were more or less allied with Franklin, if not at least neutral toward him. Especially as the memories take place in 1776, the American Assassins would be led by Connor/Ratonhnhaké:ton at the time, and I seriously doubt anyone would have been sent to Paris to harm or kill him. I doubt it would be the Paris Brotherhood either, assuming the Paris and American Brotherhoods were in contact and/or had similar goals.

Are they independent actors? Are they Templars? Are they Assassins or their allies? Did Ubisoft just leave a plot hole and not bother addressing it?

1g5zpia,Wire_Jag,2024-10-18 03:51:12,I miss the way the plot lines were in the old AC games tbh,30,8,"Personally I LOVED the modern day plot. It broke up the historical action quite well and gave a really good and iteresting reason to keep going back. And the sci-fi theming overlaid with the recreation of the historical setting was just such a great catalyst for immersive story telling and convincing atmosphere. They did it soooo well in the original games all the way through AC3 and even black flag was great even though that was the point where it started falling off. I miss you Patrice Desilets.

I realize a lot of people disagree with me and that makes me a little sad because I feel all the people who disagree vastly missed the point of the plotline and theme of Assassin's Creed in general. People want instant gratification and they lack any sort of patience or respect for nuance and it has helped dumb the industry down as a result. Everyone votes with their wallets and where I like to sit on the patio, enjoy my morning pour-over coffee, and listen to the birds chirp, these other generations immediately load up on morning TikTok, grab a monster, and run out the door for work or school.

1g3y61s,VincentPastor,2024-10-15 11:04:04,"AC Valhalla's detection is not broken, just never explained",54,52,"I'm tired of hearing people claim that ""AC Valhalla's detection is broken, sometimes guards won't see you, sometimes they'll detect you from a mile away."" It's not true. It's just that the rules of detection were never clearly explained.

Now, to be clear, yes, there can be detection bugs at times, it happened 3-4 times in my 250h of gameplay that I got detected through a wall for example. But it's not nearly as prevalent as people say. Like every Ubisoft game, it lacks polish which can be frustrating if you're going for a full stealth run or trying to do perfect mastery challenges , but it's not broken.

So here's a breakdown of how it works:

- At first, detection is pretty easy to play around with. Guards' vision cones are pretty limited and you can kill them easily by sneaking around them or moving fast between cover or attacking from above. Especially if you're in an area or camp where enemies are spread out, it's pretty easy. That's the first layer of stealth.

- Now, the thing about Valhalla is that it changes the rules of detection once you've killed somebody and other guards investigate the area, making it the only AC game where hiding bodies actually matter. Generally, the music will cue will change so you'll know the body is being investigated. From then on, if you are in an enemy's cone of vision, doesn't matter how far or high you are, you will get seen within seconds unless you're hiding behind something or in a bush. This means that you have to be way more careful about how you navigate the area and if an enemy starts detecting you, kill them immediately if you want to stay stealthy. The only way to stay undetected is to either draw an enemy's attention somewhere else or stay right behind them. You'll generally get a sound cue once the investigation is over and enemies are back to the first state of detection.

- The issue with changing the rules of detection is that one, it's never explained to the player, and two you never get a visual indicator like an icon above an enemy's head for example to tell you that they are in investigation mode, making it confusing for most players and leading to people claiming stealth is inconsistent and broken, but again these players just misunderstand the state of the enemy's detection.

- Lastly, for people claiming that camps are not designed for stealth, that is not true. You can generally stealth kill entire camps if you choose to do so. It just presents its own unique set of challenges. Yes, there are sometimes large groups of enemies BUT you can disperse them. The camps are usually designed with either contextual smoke you can trigger by shooting a bag or explosive oil jars. People have claimed the raven is useless, but that's exactly what it's for. Scouting the area for opportunities like that. You can also use your exploding arrow to hurt and disperse a large group. There are people claiming you can't shoot an enemy inside a group without being detected. Again, not true. You can do it, you just have duck back behind cover very fast to avoid detection, that's all. And once you've killed somebody and the enemies are investigating, be careful no one's looking your way if you want to shoot someone else. Otherwise, again, you'll be detected within seconds.

I'm just generally tired of everyone destroying this game and claiming it's the worst thing that ever happened. The game has tons of flaws it's true. It's bloated, it's a representation of some of the worst practices in the video game industry with the micro-transactions, it's got shallow parts and iterates on some ideas from Origins and makes them worse at times. But it's still a game I love with a fantastic world, great story, and some really awesome gameplay mechanics. It lacks polish, yes, but it's not the horrible game the fans say it is. AC III remastered is far buggier and has far less tools to get out of detection for example (I love AC III but the stealth is frustrating).",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1g3y61s/ac_valhallas_detection_is_not_broken_just_never/,assassinscreed
1g3p9ab,Hungry-Sir6349,2024-10-15 04:02:41,Ubi needs to start making numbered AC entries again ,0,31,"UBI NEEDS TO MAKE ANOTHER NUMBERED AC ENTRY

Ok in short AC is a very important series in my “gaming adolescence” and is a pivotal franchise due to how it opened my mind to other types of games making me fall in love with gaming in general. 

That said I want to nite, I’m not a purist, as much as I loved those original action adventure styled AC titles, I don’t mind the new RPG formula. I personally think of the 3 newer entires in the Layla trilogy, Origins is the best hands down. With Bayek & Anya being the best written characters in a long time.

Now as the years have gone by Ubi has obviously put this series grand narrative on the back burner in favor of 100 hr RPG experiences. Shadows will be one of those so I’m not expecting them to really shake anything up come 2025.

However, the greatest flaw this series has (and has had) is its writing, and post-Origins I personally feel like the series writing is absolutely dreadful. You’d think them making RPGs would force them to care a bit more about the writing but here we are.

The point being, I think the only way to get the grand narrative back on track is by having an official Assassin’s Creed 5 go into production. It was always my hope that these titled AC games would remain as spin offs, with the numbered entries being the main plot. But it’s been almost a full decade since we’ve truly had any sort of coherent story. 

The newer games have inched forward but only serve the purpose of setting up more stories threads that won’t pay off anytime soon.

So to me, the only way you do that is by bringing back a certain someone, and having another numbered entry. B/c honestly, idk if I can take another decade of this series going nowhere. Make it an action adventure game, make it an RPG, make it a turned based gotcha game for all I care. Just for the love of god, get this worlds story back on track somehow.

Why the hell were we able to pick genders in Odyssey and Valhalla only for Ubisoft to insist that playing the female in both instances was 100% canon? I'm not inherently bothered by the prospect of female protagonists, I just think it's weird to give us a choice that doesn't really matter. I usually pick the male option in games and I liked Alexios a lot in Odyssey, so I was a little annoyed that my choice wasn't acknowledged in Valhalla. To me it feels like Ubisoft dangling the carrot only to yank it back at the last second. If they wanted female protagonists then why not just have female protagonists?

1g0soze,AFRandomsketch,2024-10-11 04:42:51,Assassin's Creed Black Flag/ New Pirate game idea ,2,6,"I think this is some things they should add in AC Black Flag Remaster/Remake( I hope):


1. Rum always accessible on ship or other locations

I want to get drunk on ship or visiting every island cause what kinda pirate doesn't get drunk right? 



2. Drunk animations

In the game, if you drunk, only camera is affected, I want Edward become drunk physically not just add motion blur effect, and add the level of drunkness, like after 1-3 drinks, Edward walk like a drunkard, wait 30 seconds and back to normal , but 3-5 drinks and you just sleeps at last checkpoint



3. Fully Customizable ships and Use Captured ships

A lot of players complain about this, Ubisoft should makes customizable ships or use captured ship, or if that's too much , just make players can fully customizable Jackdaw, from interior to everything, so I can make it into Black Pearl , Queen Anne Revenge, Flying Dutchman or any fantasy ships so I don't need to go to nexus to download mods, cause I remember in Brotherhood we can dye Ezio outfit, it's not much but it's fun to have that so they should make this available, but it's Ubisoft so I didn't have too much hope



4. Let Adewale/Anne Bonny pilot your ships

Let your quartermaster pilot your ship, they also will not engage in naval combat, just autopilot while you can getting drunk on the ship while singing with the crews. And after 5 drink on ship Edward will sleep on the ship, and you can choose either fast travel or just watch the scenery like in Red Dead Redemption. The camera will stay in 3rd person so you can walk around the ship while your firstmate autopilot your ship



5. Blend in crowd animation

Make Edward blend in with crowd with crowd animations, not just stands there like a creepy stalker at 3 AM



6. Add Kraken / mermaids / or /ghost ships at night in certain locations/maybe at the end of the map


Cause why not? Make the game more fun




7. Enhanced sea weather/effects

Higher/bigger rogue waves, whirlpool, thick fog



8. Customizable forts/ Able to conquer other Islands

Customize all forts & make available island that can be captured/conquered , with your flag will be shown at the island you've conquered, now I feel more like true successful pirate emperor/Yonkou



9. Ship boarding system in rogue

Your ship can be boarded like in AC Rogue



10. More unique naval/pirate mission with Blackbeard & other Pirate captain

For example, when Edward found unique treasure maps (maybe like 15 unique treasure maps) Edward can choose who to invite  : Blackbeard /Rackham/Ben/Kid/ Vane to accompany you, and different characters gives you different cutscenes or storylines



11. Mutiny/Crew Betrayal


An annoying features but maybe like every crew you rescue or buy at tavern, maybe 3 or 4 people will commit mutiny, and there will be fights on ship like a tavern fight, if you lose , you will left at desserted island or random places, and you need to find information when your ship last seen, searching infos at tavern, random people, guards, or even NPC conversations, But if you win , you can choose how the betrayer die: hang them upside down on your ship /shot/feed them to sharks, every mutiny/betrayal mission there's gonna be  different cutscenes and dialogues than before


12. Unique Interactions/dialogue when boarding different Ships

Different cutscenes/interaction/dialogues when meeting /Spanish/French/British/Pirate Hunter/Privateer/ Another Pirate


13. Pillage and Plunder with another Pirates/ Pirate Captain

You can ask Blackbeard and others to join you free roam across the seas or to attack another ships, each attack will increase notoriety of you and your chosen ally . There will be NPC on island talking about you when you walks beside them or landing on Island that have your wanted posters, and there's some random civilian or Navy agents will try to report you to nearest Navy soldiers, kill the informant to prevent them from sending the message. You and your ally posters will be all around another islands outside of your own turf/ conquered island


14. Wanted Posters

There's a wanted posters in AC II if I remember correctly, they should bring that back , rip that posters or bribe an officer and notoriety will go down a little , there's also different posters for another pirates, like Kid, Blackbeard , Rackham ,etc. Tear that poster and their wanted level also decrease a little. 



15. Pirate Hunters and Royal Navy 

Pirate Hunters will hunt you down with many ships or gunboat, but if your wanted level too high, Royal Navy will send Man O War  Armada to hunt you. 



16. Maps to the New World


Can travel to another Sea/ or another country but I think this is too much lol, if you be able to travel all 7 seas, you're get Achievement "" Sailors of 7 Seas ""


17. More options for Custom outfits/ Custom Jolly Roger /Flag logo

Need a customization like in AC Black Flag multiplayer, we need our own signature pirate look, with our own Jolly Roger


18. Can interact/ sit /hangout with people on bench and get drunk together


I think that's what they should do in the next remaster, but I think they just enhanced graphics, but I do hope they add things like this, do comment your thoughts on this, I love to hear your own ideas ",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1g0soze/assassins_creed_black_flag_new_pirate_game_idea/,assassinscreed
1g0p9qf,DomFakker37,2024-10-11 02:13:52,I actually love AC: Unity! Sorry (or not?) for being 10 years late.,101,59,"From what I've read, Unity has one of the worst reputations of all the AC games, but if I understand it correctly, the reason for this comes mostly out of the technical issues the game had when it launched back in 2014. I guess I'm glad I did not know anything about the game back then, thus my experience was not ruined.

I just started it recently and the game is amazing! Sure, it gets a little time to get used to, but the visuals are astonishing, the cutscenes are not boring, the story is (despite some small flaws) really good and the missions are rich!

**Visuals:**

The details in faces are almost unbelievable, considering the game came out in 2014. I probably can't name any game that looked that good back in that time except The Witcher or GTA V, which really surprised me. Not only that, the streets of Paris look really good, whether it's the dirty outskirts or the noble houses of the rich people. This is also the first AC game where there is that many pedestrians just randomly doing their stuff and blocking your way. I suppose this is a performance issue, and since this was the first AC released for PS4 (correct me if I'm wrong), I understand that the devs were able to go a step further this time.

**Missions:**

The quests aren't repetitive at all, there was not a single time when I would feel bored. The main story missions are innovative, the side quests are not long, they're simple (that goes to basically every side mission, such as helping your assassin fellows or helping your Social houses etc). I also adore the way the game handles assassinations, it basically gives you multiple options how to enter, how to kill and how to deal with situations. I love that you can simply run at your target and stab them, but you can think your approach through and choose your way of distracting the guards and getting in. There is also not that many tailing missions, which AC series is (mostly negatively) famous for, which I really appreciate.

**Collectibles:**

Another typical AC mechanic (not only, I guess). I remember being tired to death when collecting feathers in Ezio's trilogy. I also hated collecting anything in Connor's game. But Unity? Nothing feels forced. There are chests that have some kind of interaction to it, which is fun. There are cockades that are your typical AC collectible, you usually have to free-run or climb to get them, nothing excessively boring though. And there are side-missions that, as I menitoned, are not long enough to be boring, even though they're sometimes vague thanks to that, so completing them feels good, unlike some previous AC titles.

**Controls:**

They feel clunky when one starts with Unity right after finishing Black Flag and Rogue, and they get some time getting used to, but once you do, the controlled descent is an amazing thing and so is the intentional climbing. I still sometimes jump up instead of jumping down just cause it's not intuitive for me, but I guess I'll learn that. The combat system is not bad at all, even though it's tough for a beginner, who is used to clear fights without even upgrading his weapons, to die after two hits. Not being able to use enemies as Human Shiled and not being able to Whistle is surprising and not a welcome choice, but again, it's not that hard to get used to the new system.

**Coop:**

This is the only thing that I have a problem with, since it seems that [since 30th September, noone has achieved a PS trophy that is strictly linked to coop play](https://psnprofiles.com/trophy/3072-assassins-creed-unity/46-never-say-die). That, sadly, applies to me as well, since I'm unable to connect to anyone, I just get the ""Connection Failed 0x70000006 Error"". And I'm not the only one, many people playing on consoles seem to have the same issue. It seems like the servers are down, even though on Ubisoft's page it says that they're not. I tried going through their PS5 troubleshooting guide and I tried following some random advice from people with similar issue but nothing worked for me. It's a shame, since this is the only thing that prevents me from getting the platinum trophy, but most importantly, I can't enjoy the coop gameplay that I was really looking forward to, especially since I was hoping for something better than that poorly executed multiplayer from Black Flag. I contacted the Ubisoft Support, currently waiting for their reponse, but in case anyone too has this issue, please, let me know.

  
So that's it, that's my post, AC: Unity is awesome and I really hope I'll be able to enjoy 100% of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1g0p9qf/i_actually_love_ac_unity_sorry_or_not_for_being/,assassinscreed

1fy3yj7,pyrofire95,2024-10-07 17:57:20,It's so exhausting talking to people about AC outside of this sub. (Series appreciation and thoughtfully written ramble),54,148,"Firstly Thank you everyone here for being respectful and reasonable humans.  
We all have our reasons for being here and appreciation for these games, what they've been and what they can be.  
What they've given us and the hours they've taken.  
Within the vastness of this illusory world of the internet there is a blanketed and ignorant view of what these games are and what they should be, the grand majority of the time falsely informed by a misunderstanding of what these games achieve as well as simply what they are, what makes them Assassin's Creed games.  
It seems to me that many gamers do not know that they just might not like something and instead of peacefully going on to something they do enjoy, they put effort into poorly barking vague demands of what AC games should do. They do this without points of specific critique and no offers of solution.  
The past sins of Ubisoft have blinded denizens to the great lengths and strides the series has made and accomplished.  
  
Thousands of people around the world have been pressed into the machine to put these games out as consistently has they have been, and in putting these peoples life force into them they have been able to iterate, experiment, and expand what these games can be, what it looks like to be an AC game. No two games are completely alike. The cost of this frequent iteration is the appearance of stagnation but small iteration over a decade makes any two games that far apart look very different. Other franchises might take 8 years to create a follow up and for that have an appearance of a great change. It's all perspective but it's all the same change, but the greater frequency has the added benefit for more iteration, more feedback, less risk for trying something new, so each AC game has.  
I haven't put to paper exactly what I believe to be the pillars of the series is but quickly, an offer of what they might be.

1. Immersion into a place and time.
2. Strongly Characterized Protagonist who is driven yet conflicted and challenged
3. Unending struggle between Freedom and Control

Historical accuracy is NOT a pillar of this series, never has been, and never stated so. It state before each game this is a work of fiction. They promote these games with the tagline ""History is our playground"" There is dialog in the first game stating that what is seen in the animus is the ""real"" past (if the simulation hasn't already been altered by Abstergo.) The games are the ""truth"" behind grand conspiracy.  
Any inaccuracies are not wrong, they are true within the games.  
It doesn't matter what Yasuke really did IRL, within the context of Shadows this is the secret life he did live.

Assassin's Creed is a modern marvel in my eyes. The technical achievement of realizing these moments in human history and allowing anyone to explore in that setting is truly something special and something you can observe being the target from the first game and improving ever since. That's why going to these REALLY massive open worlds kind of needed to happen, there's just some settings that need that scale to really feel out. Odyssey really plays right by it's name. The player goes on a truly massive journey and sees so much happen in the MCs life, so for me it really feels like coming home when I retired that game by traveling back to Kassandra's home, saving and quitting there. (then the vacation episode released)  
Ubisoft was on high with the Ezio trilogy. He was their mascot, the games were wildly successful and pretty much void of the baggage of today. And they did something cool with Ezio. They let him grow up, and they let Ezio die. A fan can follow Ezio's life LITERALLY from the moment he emerges from his mothers birth canal until he takes his dying breath.  
  
That is just incredible, magical, something heavy, and felt.  
\[next paragraph kinda spoils a scene at the end of AC Revelations\]  
Ezio's monologue when he finds Altairs corpse in Revelations is one of the most beautiful scenes ever put to screen for all that it carries. Working the whole game to unseal a vault of untold value. He only finds little more than the remains of Altair, then Ezio pays his respects to a brother he has never really met. Then in this powerful scene where Ezio has a flicker of memory the name Desmond reaches his mind. Ezio admits there is something much bigger than himself happening as he admits he doesn't understand how but knows that Desmond is listening, he acknowledges that he's realized that he's only a messenger after spending his whole life chasing something with a drive he couldn't explain. But without bitterness on that fact he only appreciates the beauty in it and says, ""Who are we, who have been so blessed to share our stories like this? To speak across centuries?"" GAH DAYUM.

Yes there are entries that I kinda hate, but I still love them.

Now I see a lot of people reacting to this news in shock but personally I don’t think it’s that big of a deal as this number of games includes spinoffs, multiplayer games, and mobile games alongside mainly single player games and remakes. With leaks and news from the past few years I think we can deduce what these ~10 games are and how many are really mainline entries and how many are spinoffs or mobile games

1. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is obviously the first game in this lineup, set to release on February 14, 2025 after it was delayed. I think the most interesting thing about this game is the impact of its delay on the rest of the lineup.
2. Assassin’s Creed Jade is most likely the second game to come out in this lineup in my opinion. This is a mobile game and a spinoff from the main series and is being developed collaboratively between Ubisoft and Level Infinite which is a subsidiary of Tencent. It had a closed beta in late 2023 and has been delayed numerous times but is now rumored to be releasing in Q2 of 2025
3. Black Flag Remake is what I think will either be the third or fourth game released in this lineup. Now I think I and many people assumed this game was much farther away from being released but as recently reported by Insider Gaming it was targeting a November 2025 release. Though this release has been impacted by the delay of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. I think they either have two roads they can take, keep the release of Black flag remake in November 2025 or delay it to early 2026.
4. Assassin’s Creed Invictus is a multiplayer game in the Assassin’s Creed universe. It has been rumored for 2025 and would’ve been released around when the black flag remake would’ve been released. We don’t know if it’s release will be impacted by the Shadows delay but I feel that if it is it will be to a lesser extent than the Black flag remake as it is a multiplayer spinoff. The game itself has been compared to fall guys with an assassin’s Creed skin, so make of that what you will.
5. Assassin’s Creed Hexe is the next mainline entry in the series and has been rumored to release in 2026 though it may be impacted by the Shadows delay too.
6. Assassins creed Raid is rumored to be another multiplayer game the will be a PvE game. Now this is speculation but I think it will be the sixth entry in this lineup and will release in tandem with Hexe.
7. Assassin’s Creed Netflix is rumored to be a mobile game released on Netflix. Now I really don’t have any speculation on when this could release but I would assume it could be release anytime in the next 3-4 years. I doubt that the release date of this will have any effect on the rest of the lineup.
8. Assassin’s Creed Nebula is what I think will be the next original mainline entry in the series. It is rumored to be in early development but we know that it is a single player game and will take place in three different settings: India, the Mediterranean, and the Aztec Empire. This will most definitely release after Hexe and I assume around 2028 or 2029
9. The second Assassin’s Creed was announced when Yves Guillemot stated that Ubisoft had multiple Assassin’s Creed remakes in development. I think the most likely game this is remaking is the first Assassin’s Creed as it is very outdated game play wise and this game could release at its 20th anniversary. This game could also be remaking Assassin’s Creed 2. I think this game most likely releases sometime in 2027, 2028, or 2029.
10. Assassins creed Echos is a multiplayer game rumored to use Ubisoft Scalar cloud technology. Outside of that nothing else is really known.

Now this really shows what the 10 games in the Assassin’s Creed line up really are. Only half of them are true single player mainline entries to the franchise (shadows, black flag remake, Hexe, nebula, and the other remake). The rest seem to be mobile games and multiplayer spinoffs of the series. Now there have been small rumors of a second nexus game being discussed at Ubisoft but seeing how nexus had somewhat disappointing sales I doubt that a sequel will be going ahead. There have also been small rumors about what Ubisoft Bordeaux is working on but nothing substantial.

1fxcksl,Experiment_612,2024-10-06 17:18:14,What happened to the Animus?,0,26,"I can remember as a teenager picking a random game from the store which just so happened to be AC 1. It was beyond what I expected-- a unique story that blended history with fiction, with a firm tone that set a serious dynamic, with mutli-plot stories happening between Altair and Desmond/The Animus. The mystery and intrigue in the storytelling was and still is masterful in my opinion, and when AC 2 came out it expanded upon the story and the Animus, and improved gameplay & QOL mechanics similarly to the jump from Borderlands 1 to 2. The first 2 AC games were simply just legendary.

Around the time Brotherhood was coming out was when AC was really peaking in popularity, yet I started to lose my interest in it. I could tell, even as a teenager, that this was quickly becoming something different than the original vision (look no further than 343's Halo trilogy lol). I actually never played Brotherhood because I didn't want to be disappointed, and I felt content enough to walk away from the series after the first 2 games.

I still today don't know what Brotherhood or Revelations are about, or anything about the games since then. I had actually bought The Assassin's Creed Ezio Collection back around 2018 and intended to play those two games, but Ubisoft actually removed the game from my library, unbeknownst to me, whom had PAID for it (I was not the only one, either). And now more recently I'm seeing Ubisoft just come out and brazenly tell customers that they don't own the games they buy from Ubisoft? What in the actual fook?

My main question is, what happened to the Animus? I never hear anyone talk about the Animus anymore regarding Assassin's Creed, which is an absolute shame considering it was one of the most brilliantly creative ideas in any fantasy/fiction/sci-fi story I've ever seen. I've been more recently keeping up with the debacle that is Assassin's Creed Shadows, and how they essentially had someone write fake lore on a character that may or may not have even existed, just to then reference said fake lore as official? 😂🤦‍♂️

My main grievance from an outside perspective would be that they are going about creating plots entirely wrong. I would love to see a character in the Animus that maybe is misremembering history, or maybe there is a virus in the Animus someone creates and as a result different time periods and assassins are clashing, maybe there is a time traveling assassin that is erasing or rewriting history, there's just so much more they could do with the story than JUST creating some random characters, real or not. I would also wish Ubisoft the best of luck, but they stole my game I bought from them, so it's really satisfying to watch them implode.

Deliberations come after fall in game developer’s share price

Tencent, Guillemot family hold minority stakes in French firm

Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Ubisoft Entertainment SA’s founding Guillemot family are considering options including a potential buyout of the French video game developer after it lost more than half its market value this year, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Chinese tech company and Guillemot Brothers Ltd. have been speaking with advisers to help explore ways to stabilize Ubisoft and bolster its value, the people said, asked not to be identified discussing a private matter. One of the possibilities being discussed would involve teaming up to take the company private, according to the people.

Shares of Ubisoft have fallen 54% in Paris trading this year, giving the company a market capitalization of about €1.4 billion ($1.5 billion). Tencent owned 9.2% of Ubisoft’s net voting rights at the end of April, while the Guillemot family held about 20.5%, according to the firm’s latest annual report.

Some minority shareholders including AJ Investments have been pushing for either a take-private or a sale of Ubisoft to a strategic investor amid the stock price plunge. Considerations are at an early stage and there’s no certainty they will lead to a transaction. Tencent and the Guillemot family are also considering other alternatives, according to the people.

Spokespeople for Ubisoft and the Guillemot family declined to comment. A representative for Tencent couldn’t immediately comment during a holiday week in China.

Last month, Ubisoft shares fell to their lowest in more than a decade after the company cut its outlook on weaker-than expected sales and a delay on the hotly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows title. The video game firm has over the past couple of years struggled to recover from a pandemic-era production crunch that resulted in delays in the release of new games and canceled titles.

Several private equity firms including Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. were studying potential bids for Ubisoft in 2022 amid a flurry of large deals in the video game industry, Bloomberg News reported at the time. Later that year, the founding family partnered with Tencent, which bought 49.9% of the Guillemot Brothers holding company in addition to the direct stake it held in Ubisoft.

The deal was seen by analysts as a way of keeping suitors at bay, allowing the brothers to remain in control of the Ubisoft’s governance with Tencent’s stake capped below 10% with no operational veto rights. Under the deal, Tencent also couldn’t sell its shares in Ubisoft for five years, after which the Guillemot family has the right of first refusal. The pact still allows the brothers to talk and work with whoever they want, Ubisoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yves Guillemot said in an interview last year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1fw0evu/tencent_guillemot_family_are_said_to_consider/,assassinscreed

On the positive side

-music

-I would say that the tone of the story is very original, humorous, different.

-The city of London is pretty good, a little repetitive but good.

-The leveling system and being able to upgrade two characters at the beginning seemed interesting to me to differentiate the style of play, too bad that by the end of the game it has no relevance.

-The hook seemed necessary because the city is huge due to the vehicles, I'm not saying that I loved it but it was good for a variety.

-A good variety of items that you can get, the problem is that many become obsolete by the theme of the levels.

On the negative side

-The story in the present world seems extremely boring to me, since Desmond died for me it doesn't make any sense anymore the assassins in the future.

-The story sometimes took some risky paths like Jacob being the perfect representation of why Shay left the assasins, the brothers' father who was the master assassin but possibly having depression, the bad thing is that it is never explored after he is mentioned.

-The character development of Jacob and Evie was practically null, I would say that the story had more to offer but the relationship between the two of them is never explored well, Jacob was deceived by the Templars more than 3 times and still remained practically the same at the end of the story.

-Many meaningless missions, killing 8 leaders seemed excessive when even in one mission you could just kill the final boss but the character said “naa I better go”, they just never end up explaining why you can't go for the final boss.

-Many secondary characters cease to have relevance even when they are interesting in their own way, maybe karl marx would have convinced Starrik to go back to the communist templars and saved the world, but it didn't happen.

-Applies a lot of the Ubisoft formula, the first missions you are blowing up trains and infiltrating enemy bases, but then you have to play a lot of normal missions to get back to these entertaining missions.

Ubisoft could have their own team dedicated to the remakes and that would actually save a lot of costs since the games are already created. Ie, you don't need to shift focus on writers, level design, etc. It's all already there. I think that would be a way to give a stable revenue to Ubisoft while they work on the new AC titles, and there won't be surprises since these games have existed for years.

  
Imagine having an Ezio trilogy on Unreal 5 with newer models, maybe a bit more mechanics from the newer games. I believe almost every fan likes to revisit these classics from time to time, I can't imagine a better way than redoing the whole game on a better engine and with updated art. It should cost a fraction of what makes a full blown AC game with 90% less risk, as long as the remaster delivers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1fvgla2/wild_idea_releasing_a_remaster_every_year/,assassinscreed

Now, if ubisoft planned this game as a more mainline entry instead of a backup plan for last gen due to AC unity being next gen only and the developers had enough time to give a solid concept of a story enough justice it could have been an easy top 5 entry for me but for what it's worth it's a great farewell from the franchise to the Xbox 360 and ps3 era and I'll definitely take that over some botched last gen version of AC unity like some companies were doing around the time ",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1fvag4q/ac_rogue_is_an_impressive_game/,assassinscreed

Even if it something a simple as ""Here is a free cosmetic!"" Or ""We will give you some Ubicoins to get an item from the store!"", I just hope they do something!!!

A microtransactionless, fully complete experience that launched almost without a single bug to an audience that widely accepted the game to be good! Of course there were complaints that it's combat system was sub-par, but it was designed with stealth in mind so that is fine!

1ftleaw,Euro_Twunk,2024-10-01 19:05:55,Assassin’s Creed III Remastered is Borderline Unplayable!?,0,15,"For years I’ve been hearing diehard AC fans talk about how AC3 has really stood the test of time, and is a much better game than it was ever given credit for. And while I’ve replayed the Ezio games, Black Flag and Unity countless times, I realised that I haven’t actually touched AC3 since my first playthrough on release. So I decided it was a perfect opportunity to rediscover this game, and I dived into the Remastered version on my Xbox Series S.

Now the reason I am making this post is genuinely not just to rant, but because I am confused. I remember the original had its fair share of bugs, most of which I kind of assumed would have been patched since release, like with Unity. And while I never did play Unity on release and only got into it over the past couple of years, at which point, while still janky, most of the major things were fixed,  I am now two-thirds of the way through AC3 Remastered, and I have straight up encountered more bugs and jank in these 10 hours or so than I have encountered over the hundreds of hours playing (patched) Unity.

Some of the issues I have encountered, off the top of my head:

* Enemy detection is fucked. I’ve had enemies detect me while their back is completely turned to me, while at other times I’ve run past half a fort of enemies (restricted area) and nobody has even paid me any notice. Another example was aiming at an enemy with my bow through the slats of some rundown stairs, clearly out of sight, but as soon as Connor started to aim my target detected me from over 20 feet away. Perhaps you might count that last sample as “jank” rather than “bug”, but it still makes for an incoherent stealth experience. Also, when one guard detects you, EVERY guard within your map radius detects you, even if they were several metres away behind a wall. It means that if you make a mistake in stealth there is little chance to reset and you’re just drawn into combat, which is particularly infuriating when the stealth mechanics are so inconsistent—for the enemy detection reason as well as others I will mention.
* Tall grass is fucked. On multiple occasions I have tried to slide into tall grass to quickly change cover before enemies spot me, only to have Connor stand there like an idiot instead of crouching. Also, if I try to aim my bow while crouched in tall grass, Connor will not actually stand up to aim and it is impossible to shoot—but enemies will still spot me as though he is.
* I’ve also encountered a bug a couple of times where enemies become alert so I take cover, but then they never let up. Their detection bar will fade to light yellow/grey but then it stays there, and they will follow me permanently as I continue moving through tall grass or underwater, staring right at my location but not detecting me, nor giving up.
* At times enemies will have the detection metre, while at other times they’ll just instantly spot me. Maybe this is a feature that I’m not aware of rather than a bug, in which case I’d love to know about it, but I’ve found this happens inconsistently both in and out of restricted areas, when I’m both notorious and incognito, and usually with groups of redcoats (as opposed to there being one particular type of enemy that always instantly detects me). I’ve also encountered a bug where my notoriety metre doesn’t reset after bribing a Herald—though it shows as incognito, I still get detected by every guard until I get notoriety to 1 again so I can bribe another Herald—so maybe they’re related?
* Pop-in for days. Unity still has this problem, sure, but straight up nowhere near as bad as what I’ve been seeing so far. And I can be far more forgiving in a game as visually ambitious as Unity that’s trying to render a crowd of 200 people than constantly having random pop-in while traversing the sparsely-populated Frontier—in a remaster of a 12 year old PS3 game that I am playing on my 9th gen console.
* On multiple occasions mission objectives have failed to trigger despite all attempts, forcing me to restart.

So what I want to know is: was the original this bad, or are most of these issues from the Remastered version? Because while I remember encountering glitches, I don’t remember it being this infuriating—though 14-year-old me, who didn’t play lots of different games and was just excited for the next AC, would have had a much higher tolerance, which is why I’m asking. Did I fire up the wrong version? And if not, what the fuck is going on? How is this not being dragged through the mud? As someone who has gone to lengths to defend Ubisoft and the AC franchise over the years—sometimes against my better judgment, because I really care about this franchise—I am actually furious that they have the nerve to sell a REMASTER for $40 US/$70 in my currency when it’s this fucking broken.

And has anyone else encountered all these issues with the Remaster? I’ve seen a lot of players reporting bugs with it (which from my understanding seem to be more prevalent with consoles than PC), but I didn’t think it would be quite this bad. As someone who plays exclusively stealth, even in the RPG games, I’ve pretty much just given up by this point and resorted to going into everything guns blazing since I feel like I can’t rely on the stealth system at all: I don’t know when it’s going to work, and when it’s going to completely shift itself and fuck me over in the middle of a fort.

In short, when you guys say you love AC3, which version are you referring to exactly? Because I was so excited to rediscover this game all over again, but it’s left nothing but a sour taste in my mouth.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ftleaw/assassins_creed_iii_remastered_is_borderline/,assassinscreed

Do we owe it to these cultures to view these games with a critical lense? 

Ubisoft had always presented the mission of Assassins Creed to be a perfect blend of accurate and recognizable history in order to create a recognizable snapshot of the time. Not just a world you could play in, but a museum you could engage with in a unique way. I remembered when I was younger sitting and reading each description for people and landmarks, because the idea that this was a real world you were inhabiting and not just a fantasy world. But now adays, it feels as if the games focus more on creating the recognizable snapshot of the world. Valhalla felt very phony to me, simply because it was abundantly clear that anyone who looked at the Vikings actual history for more than five seconds would understand that these Vikings never existed. At this point, Vikings did not have tattoos, their boats are inaccurate, and worst of all is the Christian Stave Churches that are rewritten in this game to be Norse Pagan temples. 

In my opinion, the fact of the matter is that the History is important. It is tantamount to exactly what Assassins Creed is and how its storyline functions. Dont you think its important that these real world groups of people are represented correctly? That these snapshots they provide of these worlds give us not just whats recognizable, but what was important at the time? Assassin's Creed was a virtual museum before a game. It was the design philosophy for each of the earlier games.

1fq17k0,oofsiswhy,2024-09-27 01:03:10,Unity Dead Kings Once Again Shows That Ubisoft Fumbled,0,16,"I don't mean to make this sound clickbaity, just wanted to give my thoughts after finishing Unity and playing Dead Kings.

After playing Unity, I needed a breath of fresh air. I have described my thoughts about that game in a previous post, and suffice to say that I was not impressed. So you can imagine my dismay when I learned that Dead Kings was a free DLC. So I gave it a try. I really liked the vibe of the special outfits that it gave (the ones with hoods at least,) and hoped that the guillotine gun would solve alot of the problems that I had with the Rifle type weapons, which you actively incentivized not to use by the mechanics of combat. So I downloaded it in the last few hours of Unity gameplay and gave it whirl when I finished the main story.

I'd like to start off with saying that I love the way they present this dlc. I am not sure if anyone else has made this comparison, but it reminded me alot of the dlc from AC2 that I cant remember the name of. (With it starting with Ezio and Leonardo discussing the uses and dangers of the apple.) This one begins with Arno receiving one last job to get him out of France from the Marquis of Sodom. And despite the fact my man was dead at this point and history and they didn't really explain it, I have no problems with this. I also love that it immediately forces you to engage with the catacombs. Your first mission sees you infiltrating a military controlled cathedral to get to the entrance of the tomb of Kings.

Throughout my playthrough of Unity, something about Paris struck me as really weird. Despite the fact that the city of Paris is old, like old as balls, it felt as if the ruins in the city were underutilized. Throughout the previous installments of these games, we're taught to think critically of not just the world our character inhabits but the landmarks that mark the city's beauty. Through playing Ezio, Connor, Edward, and Shay we are given a glimpse of the deeper world building of the Isu civilization. It is pretty much fed to us that the precursor temples are like people magnets, and sacred places are often built over the top of these temples. Churches, lost citys of treasure, and even sacred ancient cave paintings mark these locations, almost as a reminder to the people that inhabit the lamds around them what they live om top of. Places of great wisdom and knowledge. And I am sorry, but I have a hard time believing the cathedral in Lisbon had a temple under it but not Notre Dame.

You can imagine my surprise when, while playing Unity, every attempt at exploring a catacomb or ancient ruin felt shallow. None of the care for detail that was shown in the previous games. And though that also ropes in a whole mess of issues with how they handle the legacy of Assassins in France, I want to specifically focus on how Dead kings fixes this problem.


To start off, I know they fumbled, because the Franciade as a setting feels infinitely richer as a setting and solves alot of the core gameplay loops that I had issues with in the main game. To start off, the weapons all felt better to use. The Franciade provides you with alot of large areas with lots of cover, and their design alone is infinitely better. Where the base game built a large open sandbox with lots of crowds to shift between, St Dennis is effectively a ghost town by the time Arno arrives there. This changes the gameplay drastically. Enemies exist within small, easy to handle clusters, that provide the additional caviot of not always following strict patrol routes. With the various amounts of cover provided, the detection system felt better to engage with. The restricted areas were not crowded with people, they felt more meaningful. St Dennis has alot of smaller buildings compared to Paris, allowing you to leverage the short distances that usually are between you and the enemy. The tight, but large spanning above ground spaces give you back that Assassin fantasy that I feel Unity lost, while still forcing you to think about what you are doing. One guard is all alone, but his patrol path overlaps with another group of guards. I can use his body to line up an easy double assassination. That was the first time in years of being an Assassins Creed fan where I interacted with the body moving mechanic, and it was brought on simply by the internal motivation of the game. With all these factors in mind, you can bet I was bringing the rifle. I felt as if, for the first time in this game, I was impacted positively by not carrying a sword. I was asked to not take on an actively worse option (as the rifle was in the main game,) but actively think about the tradeoffs of carrying the rifle and adjust my gameplay based on those tradeoffs. 

It's undeniable that within the rich world of Dead Kings, the catacombs are the stars here. First of all, the lantern mechanic was fun. I never got tired of it, and within the catacombs, it allowed you to figuratively turn off the lights and be a creature of shadows. The setting that these catacombs provide is very engaging too. During this time of revolt of the common folk, the Raiders saw this opportunity to sack and pillage the once sacred tombs and catacombs that lie below the town. Its a gross violation of morals, they are practically grave robbers. This inclusion of a real world group of people for the enemy feels very immersive to me. Based on the way the enemies treat you when you enter the mines, despite not being involved in the Assasin Templar conflict helps to reason as to why the people are afraid of the Raiders. Why there are killings in the streets, why the Franciade guard is so tight knit and flighty?

But past that, the enemies were alot more manageable too. The catacombs splits the main gameplay into two paths. Within every group of Raiders is a leader. To remain stealthy, you'll need to kill alot of Raiders in your path. The leader system presents you with a second option. If you kill the leader of the Raiders, they will all run away screaming. And though I don't know if it provides any active benefit, the game practically screams at you at every chance to make this kill a spectacle. Be the ghost of the dead kings everyone keeps claimng you to be. Avenge them.

Suffice to say this gameplay is so much more thematically engaging, and the world has alot more thought put into it.

I can't help but feel that this should have been the main game. As rich as revolutionary Paris felt, it didn't feel as if they had the care they presented in previous games. The catacombs provide shallow fetch quests and no real defference in gameplay. The churches are hollow building skins with no real meaning or weight. Compared to the setting of St. Denis, Paris feels like the shallow DLC setting, and St Denis has 1/3 of the space Paris had to work with. I am almost reminded of Freedom Cry and Rogue here. The world of Unity should have had more thought and development put into it before the game came out, the rest of the game should have had as much care as they put in Dead Kings.

I'm not very involved in this community, but is this a hot take? Did anyone else feel this way?

You get universal code which you activate on special site, and then you can choose your preferable platform. Right now it should be of course Ubisoft Connect, Steam and Epic Games Store. It is so simple and Ubisoft offers this kind of treatment previously for some add-ons, also others publishers offers something familiar sometimes. It would be absolutely great move and everyone, who buys PC version, would be able to get their preferable edition and platform. Furthermore, it's actually so bad that you must buy so expensive edition, and you really don't have a choice and in some situation you'll pay twice if you really want to play on your favorite platform. Also in my opinion it is so much easier to run native Steam games on Steam Deck or Linux in general so it's a no-brainer that the only right way is the choice in this matter.

In the shareholders post, they specify that they’ve always released games and planned to polish them with post release patches (as per outlaws & 80% of Ubisoft games) however Yves confirmed will NO LONGER be the case. 

This means from shadows and over, we are probably going to get relatively if not really well polished games from Ubisoft which is great news for shadows and future Ubi titles.

Many of their games lose multiple review points by most due to these bugs, glitches and issues, me personally, I played Valhalla on release and couldn’t enjoy a main pillar, stealth, due to genuinely broken AI that was fixed months later.



I’m hopeful now, we won’t get a Unity 2.0, we won’t get an outlaws situation, we are getting a decently polished game at the least and a really well polished game at best. 

I’ve always supported ubi, even through their hard times, but I’m very glad that the low sales of outlaws have made them aware that this isn’t the way to go, broken AI, buggy animations, facial animations that don’t have matching lip-sync - all these things truly detract from immersion and could ruin the passion and hard work devs put into a game, a few issues could be the main highlight of a gamer, with that out of the way, we can appreciate the actual gameplay and story of shadows.

Listening to players' feedback, and as an illustration of our player-centric approach, the
following important decisions relative to Assassin’s Creed Shadows have been taken:

&nbsp;

- Assassin’s Creed Shadows will now be released on 14 February 2025. While the game
is feature complete, the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide
additional time to further polish the title. This will enable the biggest entry in the
franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual
protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay
styles.

&nbsp;

- We are departing from the traditional Season Pass model. All players will be able to
enjoy the game at the same time on February 14 and those who preorder the game
will be granted the first expansion for free.

&nbsp;

- The game will mark the return of our new releases on Steam Day 1.

Guerilla Games (Horizon franchise, Killzone)- they have experience with open world games. Horizon follows a similar design philosophy to modern AC. It would be a natural fit.

Assassin’s Creed is Ubisoft’s flagship franchise, their golden goose, they really can’t afford another screwup after the Prince of Persia Sands of Time remake, Skull and Bones, and the new Star Wars Outlaws game. 

A lot of more optimistic people will argue that the game will get more polish and come out in a better state if it gets delayed, and while I would usually agree, this is Ubisoft we’re talking about. If a company like Nintendo delayed a game, than more likely than not it’s because they want to make the game as good as possible, Nintendo strives for Quality and Perfection. Ubisoft isn’t typically known for “high quality” when a Ubisoft game gets delayed, it’s typically because the game is in development hell. I don’t know why people would see AC Shadows getting delayed as a good thing based off their past delayed games, like Skull and Bones, Beyond Good and Evil 2, and the Prince of Persia Sands of Time remake, which was supposed to come out 3 years ago at this point.

As to why Ubisoft is seemingly pulling the plug on AC Shadows’ marketing, well let’s see, Shadows has been riddled with controversy since day one due to the game being an “insult” to Japanese culture, Ubisoft’s stocks are taking a leap of faith and their investors are turning on them. They are bleeding money as well, Ubisoft is probably cutting costs for the marketing because they are losing more money they are earning at the moment.

Researching Etruscan mythology has me loving how deeply the writers researched for the Isu and taking a long time to develop it properly based on it. (Ex. - Havi sleeping with Gunnlodr was a major affront as Minerva was always a virgin historically. I like how they made Aita Juno's husband, which is not mythologically accurate but make sense for the story. This also saves Jupiter from being a monster to Metis to birth Minerva. Aita was kind of a deep cut also.) I would love an all-Isu set of DLC or a side-game to explain their history and straightforward lore. Proto-templars like Shay Cormac would be good?!<

>!My complaint is, after playing Odyssey's DLCs and seeing how straightfoward it was seeing AC Valhalla and having no guide other than fan speculation for piercing the mystical veil of Eivor's mind. Where is a straightforward crosswalk from Ubisoft from mythical Asgard to Isu Asgard and understanding the 9 realms, who Loki's children were and how Hel got Odin's favor to rule her own realm yet Fenrir was imprisoned and why Jormungandr is missing (or Thor killed him)?!<

>!I'm appreciative of letting the myths live on through the veil, but as Shadows is coming out, I'm sure there will be Shinto Isu and more confusion in playing through those myths. I can learn more about them as I'm not that familiar with them, but why isn't anything clear like with Odyssey? Legendary monsters were experiments made in a place that mythologically existed near actual Greece before a volcano likely erupted and drowned the city/Toba Catastrophe. Humans were seen there living in a lower class or slaves, yet Poseidon let them escape to safety. The other regions where humans lived, they were treated somewhat ok (Elysium) or harshly (Underworld). I noticed no humans in Asgard (I think) but they were in Jotunheim and Odin draws attention to it. Finally on this, WHAT IS DAWN OF RAGNAROK AND WHY ARE NORTH AFRICANS PORTRAYED BASICALLY AS FIRE DEMONS?! WHAT IS THE SALAKAR? NO WAY THAT TRAPS SOMEONE'S SOUL. (I can see it being Hermes Staff in ball form to put people digitally into the grey. That begs the question - Baldr couldn't stop Loki from overclocking Yggdrasil? Is he in there?)!<

>!I like the subtext of some AC Valhalla interactions like how Halfdan immediately mourned killing Faravid because Isu Thor killed his wife. The writers understand this mythology on a very deep level, but I wonder if they got too deep to be able to easily explain it between Odyssey and Valhalla. Like I said above, I appreciate playing out the myths and that teaches players but it's very confusing at this point and I know it can be officially easily explained.!<

With the debates becoming more and more frenzied on the internet, I would like to know what you thought about this point.

Assassin's Creed is always marketed as a historical fantasy with quite different plots and elements. For a long time it worked quite well but for the last few installments it seems that people seem angrier on this point. No matter what AC game comes out, I have the impression that it's a hunt for historical inconsistency. 

So what I would like to know if some people really know how to draw the truth from the falsehood of this story is that AC was really a historical game or were it the people who had this idea passively? Or is it the fault of Ubisoft which has poorly marketed its game over time.

 I have seen that people simply say that from the first game Vidic clearly explained that genetic memory had big inconsistencies and could be altered by the perception of the ancestor + the one who looks but it seems that that is no longer enough to convince people (besides I can't find this moment in the game so I almost doubt it now too).",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1fnfdhr/is_the_great_war_of_historical_inconsistency/,assassinscreed

Now, while all Ubisoft games have to be launched using connect, technically, the Steam and Uplay versions of the games are “different” games in Ubisoft’s systems. If you (as many of us probably do) have some of each, you can see the little “Steam” badges under your Steam versions. Now, I’ve been playing the Uplay version, because I got it on sale one day - my collection of AC games is about 50/50 Uplay and Steam depending on where the best sales were. My copy of revelations didn’t seem to have the issues that people were reporting - that one missing exe file that seemed to be causing the problem, and the broken loading of Desmond’s Journey on animus island. All that was working fine for me, but I couldn’t activate the lost archive because UPlay no long sells it. I did, however, see someone mention that they activated a Steam DLC key in Ubisoft Connect.

Purely out of curiosity, I decided to test this out. I purchased Revelations (currently on sale) & The Lost Archive on Steam (the lost archive is still available to buy on Steam). I didn’t download, install, or activate the Steam version of the game - instead, I right clicked on the game listing on Steam and chose “CD keys” and copied the key for the lost archive. I then opened Ubisoft Connect and went to activate a key, and entered the key. BOOM. It worked!

The game went from showing as installed to not installed. I went into the game properties, did “locate installed game,” and pointed at the install location that it was already in. Connect did a file verify, and then afterwards, showed that there was a repair to do. I hit “repair,” it immediately said “done,” and then I had an update button on the game.

Has everyone playing the recent AC games experienced where your credits purchased in the Ubisoft store for use on Assassin’s Creed titles, are NOT SHARED between titles when playing a new title in the franchise?

What has been your experience with this? When did you discover that you couldn’t use the game’s in game currency across AC titles?

All I’ve seen is this language:

“Please note that Helix Credits are bound to the platform and account you purchased them for, and cannot be shared.”

So, I get not being able to go between platforms (PS, PC, Xbox) but if using the same account on PlayStation for example, you’d expect to see unused credits show up in the new game, right??

Please let me know your thoughts? This seems like a major oversight and is a clear violation of consumer protection laws related to in game currency.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1fmms2o/helix_credits_use_across_ac_games/,assassinscreed

Odyssey tends to have the absolute best. The controls are relatively smooth, filters and settings are great, and the ability to share to Ubisoft networks directly is a nice bonus. 

I like how the latest Tomb Raider and Horizon games give you options to change poses and facial expressions in Photo Mode. I’ve given up on a few images in Odyssey because of unfortunate expressions and postures. It would be nice to have that ability.

However, I notice that some games go completely silent in Photo Mode. I like that AC keeps the soundtrack during photos.

They all have strengths and weaknesses but, I truly believe AC, especially Odyssey, has the best one overall.

I will concede though, that Ghost of Tsushima’s ability to control weather elements makes it very strong.

1flrkl8,Euro_Twunk,2024-09-21 09:10:48,Why is AC viewed unfavourably among certain segments of the wider gaming population?,16,96,"I’ve only really started paying attention to gaming discourse over the last year or two, but I get the impression that a large amount of the wider gaming population, outside of the traditional AC player base, looks down on the franchise.

Now whether or not this is warranted when you consider all 13 titles—and putting aside any separate debates about Ubisoft as a company, or the recent Shadows controversies—I’d like to get a better idea of where and when this perception truly originated. Because while the series has certainly had its low points, I also think it’s produced some really good and unique titles over the years.

I don’t think Valhalla was a very good game (no offence to anyone who likes it), and I hear a lot of criticism levied towards it in particular. But did this really just start with the last major game, or does it run deeper? (Not counting Mirage, which was produced by a side studio and sold at a discounted price, since they were very upfront that it would be a smaller game using older tech.)

After the success of Black Flag, obviously Unity’s completely broken state on release marked a low point for Ubi which drew a lot of attention, and which Syndicate didn’t do much to quell. But then Origins was a genuinely brilliant game, and while I was taking a break from gaming at the time of its release, I understand now that it was actually really warmly-received (and continues to be looked upon favourably).

Afterwards we had Odyssey, and while I don’t think it’s a very good AC game for breaking a lot of the conventions that were deeply ingrained into the series’ identity, I do believe it is a genuinely great ARPG that refined some of the changes Origins implemented, and is a blast if you approach it as such—hell, it was even nominated for GOTY alongside games like RDR2 and God of War (and I’m not saying Odyssey reaches quite those heights, but still). It also sold really well, introducing the franchise to a new demographic, and paving the way for the monumental sales that Valhalla would eventually have as its immediate successor.

As for Mirage, while I personally love it and was prepared to encounter the game’s limitations that were outlined well before release, if you’re not in the AC bubble you may not have gotten that memo and just said “oh look a new AC game, let’s try it”. In which case I understand why it may not have improved your view of the series so much: it was a game made for a very specific niche of the player base that was never going to appeal to everyone, and while I think it held potential and made players like me much more hopeful for the future of the series, I could see why someone going in blind may have expected more from a AAA developer in the modern gaming landscape.

So ultimately, where does that perception originate in 2024? Do we think it comes largely from Valhalla and/or Mirage—with the former now being the last major entry in 4 years? Did it just never fully fade after Unitygate? Could it be due to the relative inconsistencies in quality between games? Could it be a spillover of the divisions in the player base itself? Or is it something else entirely—I’m just spitballing here?

I ask because with AC recently in the spotlight again, I’ve seen a lot of these views resurface among certain sections of gamers. And as someone who genuinely loves this series and wants to see it improve and continue to grow (emphasis on improve), I’d like to get a better understanding of why that perception seems to be so widespread--and why, in my opinion, some of the higher points of the series may be overlooked today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1flrkl8/why_is_ac_viewed_unfavourably_among_certain/,assassinscreed

All three games could have had such potential story wise and tie into each other in an interesting way that I think if reinterpreted with better writing and cohesion could be amazing. In particular I want to see a more morally corrupt Shay of whom maybe his ego or naivity caused the Lisbon earthquake instead of the creed's incompetence. Rogue could have been a great opportunity to play as the villain but ubisoft instead wrote the templars and brotherhood way out of character in the process of choosing the safest option by making Shay mostly a good guy. Also Connor and Arno could have been written to be more interesting but that's just me and if you like said characters and find them interesting then more power to you.

As for gameplay Rogue in particular could benefit from an overhaul, while it did add some great features such as the possibility of being boarded it all felt too similar to black flag and it felt as if the world was too centered around that aspect of which can be seen within the river valley map of which albeit beautiful is really inaccurate to the actual geography and kinda felt like it was changed too much to suit the gameplay that I personally found it less immersive. They could keep the naval combat to the North Atlantic and maybe have the river valley be an area you can explore via horse like the Levant between all the cities in AC1 albeit with more locations and things to do.

As for Unity it no doubt had great gameplay but I feel it was held back by the flaws in game design and glitches that still to some extent haunt it to this day. If rebuilt from the ground up and properly quality assessed the gameplay would be some of the best ever seen in an AC gameplay. AC3 is generally good as far as gameplay but with modern game design it could be even better, maybe more expansion into the naval combat and the frontier. The possibilities are endless. 

I know to some extent this all would prolly be unnecessary and will never happen but it just pains me seeing the untapped potential in these games.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1flb1b5/i_wish_rogue_and_maybe_even_unity_and_ac_3_could/,assassinscreed

So, after years without a console, a friend gifted me his old Xbox. I was super excited to finally catch up with all the assasssin adventures I had been missing (the last game I played was Black Flag and a little Syndicate, but my laptop couldn´t really run it), and as soon as I got home I went and got AC Origins. The trailer was amazing, the setting, the MC, the fact that Ubisoft could literally do anything since THAT was supposed to be the begginig  of it all so they could build anything they want from scracth...everything seemed like the makings of another banger of an AC. But boy, was I dissapointed. I hated how you have to level up to continue the story.; in my opinion the little side quests - that for me felt more like errands than like side quests- are annoying, time consuming don´t contribute anything and sort of halt the natural development of the story. It´s also frustrating how you can´t really fight an enemy if it´s just  a couple levels above your character; like, I get it, maybe all games have this, but I felt extrmely frustrated seeing an enemy´s level and knowing that I wouldn´t even be able to try and fight it because it would simply obliterate me. Also, maybe I´m biased or wrong, but the ""history"" side of the game felt lacking; like with every other game I was instantly researching and looking up things that have to do or happened in the game: places, people, significant events....with Origins I just never felt that the game encourged this ""learning"" side of AC (again, this is just my perspective and can totally be wrong).

I don´t want to waste more time writting about all this, but I just felt dissapointed, angry and angry at the game. Just want to hear other people´s opinions, maybe, as I said, I´m missing something or was too harsh to judge it.

1fjvr8l,JuanMunoz99,2024-09-18 23:34:09,Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ marketing is too low key and we are less than two months away from launch.,0,74,"Four months since reveal and Ubisoft seems to just not want talk about anything else other than the open world tech and the two playable characters.

How does the skill tree work and look like for both characters?

How does the skill tree work and look like for the weapons?

How does gear and loot work like? Is it like Odyssey, Valhalla, or is it something new?

Are traditional side-quests back or is it a continuation of Valhalla’s world events?

Are roaming bosses like Phylakes, Mercenaries, and Zealots back?

Do your choices have a greater impact on the story?

What IS the story of the game?

Or romance like Odyssey and Valhalla actually back?

What type of open world activities can we participate in?

1ficnbl,oofsiswhy,2024-09-17 02:53:19,"Unity was so Close: A very late, but steamy rant about the improved, bug free Unity",17,12,"I just wanted to rant for a moment, because oh lord does this game make me angry. I desparately want to love it. The story feels a bit rushed sure, but Paris is full of so much heart and love, you can tell this was a place Ubisoft wanted to explore for a while. The underground catacombs, massive gothic cathedrals and beautiful landmarks make  me want to love this game. Additionally, the parkour is the best its ever been, and Arno has to be the most talented Assassin we've seen... on that front. 

There is one thing that keeps ruining my immersion and its the detection, combat mechanics and the Black Box Missions. I want to bring up the mission where you assassinate La Touche as a specific example of why its a problem. This has to be the weakest of the Black Box missions. I have to say, I'm not a fan of this mission style as Unity and Syndicate presented it. It gives you two contextual options that allow you to get creative with the way you kill your target. Some of them will provide cover, or unique kill options. The problem? Well first of all, to say you can get creative is a bit much. In reality, the black box aspect of it just adds about 2-3 streamlined optional objectives that you can engage with. Theres no creativity to it, the game tells you exactly what to do. To be honest, when I heard youtubers talk about it, I pictured it being akin to the missions in dishonored. But for some reason, it jusy feels phony and restrictive.

For the mission with La Touche, there is a fruit stand, surrounded by guards and snipers that would remove alot of the restricted area around the stage and allow people to cover the area, giving you an easy cover. Then there was a cage full of people that you would provide you with a unique kill opportunity. (I will get to these.)

I approached this mission with immersion in mind, and tried to take a unique approach that my version of Arno would. I brought a rifle, with max range, and stocked up on my long range options. It was a good option for the fight, as guns in this game work like they did in brotherhood, meaning you could get a discreet long range kill without letting the entire enemy army knowing I'm here. This was my first time using the rifle all game, so I picked the expensive option with the High range. I wasn't sure what the max range was, but i was certain it would reach father than my pistol. (Which up until this point, had been the golden child of my playthrough.) So I start in the place I am in, I run, avoiding unnecessary kills and only taking out guards where I think I'd need an escape option. I decided to go for the snipers first. My first thought was, 'take out the first sniper with my hidden blade and then shoot the other with my rifle.' So I did exactly that, but found that rifle couldn't shoot far enough to reach the Sniper. Logic would stand to reason that if I cannot shoot him with the max range rifle, than he cannot shoot me from there right? Nope, I was taken out by a flurry of shots initiated by him. Within the internal logic of the game, he shouldn't have been able to hit me or spot me, but because it is convenient for the game thats what happens. So I decided to take out each of the snipers with the hidden blade, and then shoot the guards that were blocking me from my secondary objectives. (Keep in mind, this whole time, I am trying to get the black box stuff done for full sync.) Problem 2, my rifle can't reach the guys in the middle. I get detected because of the missed shot and thats that attempt done. (Keep in mind, all the while, I am just telling myself 'you keep messing up. Its obviously a skill issue.') So I try again, and this time, the only thing I can seem to do to succeed at this is use the berserk blade on the snipers and let them take out the guys in the middle, since once again, they have no max shooting range. At this point open combat is not an option. I'm either going to end up riddled with bullets or get interrupted during one of my finishers. So I had to engage with the much lamer option of sitting back pressed against a chimney while someone else does all of the cool stuff for me. Yea that would be a good thought, except now that I have used berserk on them, suddenly they can't shoot a guard at the same distance I was before. So now, the game has violated its own internal logic 2x without me trying to exploit it. (At this point I am just trying to play the game as a cool assassin.) At this point the only option I can see is literally just killing each guard individually and then each time returning to the rooftops to wait out the detection. So I do that, it takes forever, feels like the lamest possible option and defeats the purpose of the secondary objective. So I open the fruit stand up, half the restricted area is gone and I can get to the other objective easily. Except it doesnt matter, because no matter what you do, the guards start detecting you and aggressing when they see you walking on the street, and they will do it here too. So that secondary objective I spent all this time setting up, doesn't actually do anything for this mission.

So I go for the unique kill option. (At this point I have the fruit stand open just cuz I want the extra sync points.) I go the cage full of people, get a key for them to escape, and then return. Use the button prompt. And then Arno steps inside the cage...

The amount of smack in the face this felt like was just ridiculous. Using this unique kill option, you can ignore all detection of the guards and just sprint up and kill the guy. And the worst part is that it literally delivers you right to his feet. I know this was the worst option possible, because as soon as I exited the kill cutscene I was shot dead on the spot and had to play the mission over again. So not only did each black box option practically do nothing to give me an advantage, the unique kill option actively disadvantaged me in positioning alone. I had to spam the smoke bomb option coming out of that cutscene and I still got shot 2x trying to run away. I wish I could say that the shooting was something that only rarely affected my game, but it was basically the only setback I ever took into mind playing the game. CQC combat was manageable, until inevitably one guy would step back and fire a bullet, and then another, and then a guy on the rooftop shot me. All in the span of five seconds. Meanwhile, I am already getting my finishers interrupted by 3 different attacks hitting. 

I wish I could say that the Black Box thing was something I ran into in one mission or maybe two. But it felt this way in every mission. Engaging with the secondary objectives made your life needlessly complicated and left you with pretty much no advantage in the long run. There were 2 missions where I really felt like it made a difference. For something that I've heard praised time and time again, this system is lack luster and unimpressive. And Syndicate hasn't really solved this for me. While the options often make more sense and provide a slightly sharper edge than in Unity, I still found multiple points throughout the game where I would have genuinely benefitted more from just running up, killing the guy and running away. (The whole time I am playing as the charismatic Brute Jacob, who in character could care less about these options.)

 The combat system is meaninglessly complicated in a way that brings it no added complexity or incentivization. I can count the times during the game where open combat was a viable on one hand, and they were all the crowd events that the game practically shoved down your throat at every possible moment. Past that, in another colossal smack in the face, a group of guards like that wouldn't have been a problem for Connor or even Edward, despite the fact that they would be dealing with the same things. (Guys with swords and guns, guys with just guns, and guys with big axes.) This is because Edward and Connor were given ways to deal with being shot at that not only worked 100% of the time with enough skill, but also felt like a natural progression in Assassin Tactics as the technology evolved. Arno has a contextual dodge that can only be activated when you are directly engaging with someone. If you are in the 'detected-but-not-in-combat' state that the game loves to put you in if you turn away from combat for more than a second, then you have zero options to dodge the literal dozens of bullets that will be thrown as soon as the game thinks you're turning to run away.

I want to love this game, I do. But I can't seem to get behind a game that actively undermines my efforts and makes me look like a fool. In a perfect world, the Black Box missions would be put in a set of base game mechanics where you can feel like engaging with the secondary objectives are worth something. Black Box missions are far from the open world sandbox masterpieces I was promised by ubisoft bootlickers, and its massively disappointing. And the combat is awful. It genuinely feels like the developers were more interested in throwing things in to stump you than delivering on the Assassin fantasy. Hell, Bayek feels like a more authentic Assassin in combat prowess, and not only was he not even an Assassin for most of the game, the combat in Origins is leagues more challenging and complex in a way that feels not only more manageable but genuinely more engaging.

1fht4nj,Fine-Feature8772,2024-09-16 09:45:05,Do you think Frank Herbert's Dune would be a good mix with the Assassin's Creed universe?,1,0,"I have a confession to make, I like to combine and mesh together franchises that contain interesting world building and follow similar themes and aesthetics.

And as a devoted fan of the Assassin's Creed universe (and other major Ubisoft titles that I believe should be all in the same universe regardless what Ubisoft says), I'm also a fan of Frank Herbert's ""Duniverse"". 

I don't know how common my particular taste in fiction is, so that's why I'm here sharing it; the first thing is that I don't like magical fantasy; I'm not saying that it's bad as a genre but I try not to alienate myself much from real-world concerns since I believe that before we ought ourselves to create better worlds than this, we should instead focus on trying to reimagine the world that we already have (whether its past or future or present), which starts with the Earth we know and the universe beyond (whatever may be there).

I know it sounds stupid; but the most basic reason why I prefer Dune over Star Wars for example, is because Dune is set as the fantastical (yet not as much as Star Wars, thank god) and alien, yet still the genetic descendant of real-world Earth.

I guess I just like fantasy and science fiction to a reasonable point, not just fantasy and science fiction for the sake of fantasy and science fiction (which means that there's no limit to what can happen; which is the definition of a ""kitchen sink""; which I like the least).

Sorry for the long rank but this was important to read to understand why I'll choose anyday the likes of AC, Dune, or Tolkien's fictional pre-history known as  ""Middle-Earth"" over the likes of Star Wars, ASoIaF, or TES for example. 

I'm not judging anyone unlike me over this; I just find greater rewards in anything that has to do something with real-life, even in a very remote way. 

Back to Dune; I've been thinking this; If we would imagine the struggle between the Templars and the Assassins as continuing into the far, far future... When the Earth is only relevant as the historical origin of a human intergalactic civilization; don't you think that the way the Duniverse is set would be a perfect fit for an Assassin's Creed story?

With all the different factions fighting with each other for power, with either the Assassins or the Templars being behind them, think about how the Hidden Blade would be a very relevant weapon in this future setting where Holtzman technology renders projectile weapons useless, think about the other cool gadgets that the Dune setting already has that would sit very well with the Assassins of Assassin's Creed, but in Dune!

How about the idea that the people in Dune who use Spice too much can become literal walking Animus machines; with the ability of just tapping into some part of the brain that allows you to relive the memories of your ancestors, just as someone who would sleep in an Animus machine. 

I think the two fictional worlds would seamlessly blend with each other due to similar themes and aesthetics.

Tell me what you think?😅,0,13,"I am calling it; Assassins Creed Omega where you get all the assassins from all the franchises into one game to fight each other. Like a super mash bros or like a Dissidia game.

But that’s just one separate aspect of the game (increase replayability).

The another aspect of the game will be story driven game. The main threat to the assassins creed brotherhood would be the Mark of the Beast. So it will be like end times situation where it The Beast wants to control the whole world with the Mark and it’s upto the assassins to protect the world from The Beast implementing this agenda.

Ubisoft can also have a situation where each assassin in their timelines work to diminish the power of the Beast. Then they all come together in the End Times to defeat the Beast together.

Lastly, within all that chaos, a love story brews between some of the assassins; a betrayal also brews amongst the assassins (some of the assassins will follow the Beast) and an ultimate sacrifice of the assassins is also done in order to save the entire world.

What do you guys think? Would this be a game you would play?

If so, tell Ubisoft to contact me! I’ll totally write a story for them. All I need is my name to be on the credit and a free copy of the game 😅.

1ffg25w,LovingVancouver87,2024-09-13 07:04:45,Assassins creed origins : An almost perfect action adventure game,1,6,"I am a millenial gamer who grew up playing 8-10 hour great games of late 90s and early 2000s era and have been coming back occassionally into gaming after 30s. I have invested around 50 hours into Assassins creed now and the only other ""adventure"" game I have invested this much time into is Skyrim, so pardon me but some comparisons will ensue. 

I have to give it to Ubisoft to give us a game which just looks and plays so well. Ancient Egypt setting is just something else and the game feels incredibly polished. I hardly encountered any bugs in my 50h playtime so far. Some of the other things I loved about this game are 

* Slice of life - I am just constantly amazed at seeing people go about their daily routine i.e. catching fishes, making lunch or dinner, simply strolling around, animals carrying stuff. The wildlife is also great. Its so great to just watch the birds fly away and cats roaming around in the cities. The hippos and crocodiles are deadly but a treat nonetheless

* Exploration - This is simply great. I can wander off into the desert or explore the town helping people or hop on to one of these large ships to kill all. I can alternatively just march onto a hold or a fort and decide to kill the captain. 

* Random Encounters - Phylakes is a nice touch. I love that sometimes we have these random events where I have to help the rebels. I think this is where the game can improve. Skyrim with mods can make random encounters so much fun. 

* Combat - I found it so much better than skyrim. With a little patience, I was able to tackle on levels 2-3 levels above me. I love the fact that progression tree was giving me actually desirable abilities as I progressed i.e. ability to strike while in air, chain assassinations etc

* Senu and my mount (currently a Camel) are incredibly useful resources. I sometimes found the targetting system using Senu irritating but I have gotten used to it. The fact that I can just call them with the press of a button is a great QOL feature.

* I also like the fact that this is a mostly ""play as you want"" game. I can either do side quests and buff up my level and go blazing in or I can stealth my way to conquer the forts/holds. 

When comparing against Skyrim, I really missed just interactions with NPCs and the autosave feature. Apart from that, I think this is a great game. Bayek is a perfect protagonist, so likeable and love to play him.

1f9hw9s,Automatic_Elk_5729,2024-09-05 17:03:49,Assassins Creed 3 is still the best assassins creed game ,0,55,"I have had a lot of time to think about what AC is the best and after playing them for years and having beat every single game more than once (aside from odyssey 🤒) I can confidently say Assassins Creed 3 is still the best ASSASSINS CREED fully open world title since its release. There are many reasons as to why it trumps even the rpg games today while still lacking in some areas compared to them. But overall the game has some insane world building and design elements that have been overlooked for years. 
1. The story — Connor’s story is more in depth and focused than ANY character in the assassins creed franchise. Ezio comes very close to being equal to Connor’s story with them both having similar revenge plots and journeys to that goal, but the main difference being how alone Connor truly is. First of all he is a Native American born a little under two decades before the revolution which would be a horrible time to grow up in knowing your land could be rushed by killers any day. And the game makes this apparent with every conversation Connor has with his native family. This is a small detail that adds a much needed droplet to the ocean of detail that is Connor’s life. All these fears he already knows of before his village is attacked and his mother burned alive. With this fear confirmed he knows that there is no one in the world to help him and that his family is dead. This puts the world on his shoulders because he feels like he is the only one who can stand up to injustice, which also explains his fighting style and aversion to stealth. This is just one tiny peice of his character that is overlooked. 
2. The world — the world of assassins creed 3 is very specialized. When I first got the game upon release I treated it like gta but with knives and hidden blades, and completely overlooked all of the objectives, crafting selections (which have many game changing items), assassins contract mission, hunting missions, brawling missions, or the peg leg missions. They have been mentioned before but this doesn’t even scratch the surface of all the missions that can take up your time in game. The reason they impact the game is because of your quest and how each mission has a direct impact on the world. Whether it be liberating a prisoner in the dark streets of New York or completing a assassination contract that lowers Templar influence in some part of the city, the vast majority of missions you do impact the world even on the smallest scale. This is extremely impressive mainly because of the age of this game and it releasing in 2012. For one it is old, but your saying they had this tech back in 2012 and downgraded almost all the improvement they made when they dropped ac4 (which is great but world building events in cities was gone and never really returned except in unity). It’s just interesting because Ubisoft likes to say their RPG series is nuanced but it’s just a shiny coat of paint on the same recycled mechanics, just like unity was to assassins creed 3, except with even less mechanics and world building compared to 3.
3. The mechanics — not to sound mean but most people who have played assassins creed 3 and hated it are just bad at the game. This makes sense and it’s not a bad thing as I was terrible at the game and often put it down because of the janky controls and mechanics issues the game has at times. It took me years to realize that this was something that Ubisoft did intentionally and I had to play ac 1 and 2 a lot to realize it. What the first 2 games brought was hyper realistic parkour that relied on realistic body movement and momentum. Ac3 is a mix between Unity and ac 2’s parkour. The freedom from 2 is kept allowing Connor to move vertically at very fast speeds compared to other games in the franchise including 2, while keeping the physics realistic to his characters size, height and weight. We can assume Connor is somewhere in the 200 lb, 6’2 range and this shows with the way he has to heave himself up when he wants a head start on a building. But he is not slow or janky like people think. The controls for the game require you to be tight and decisive just like the older games because they still require that you gain some momentum unlike Unity. This realistic movement makes more sense as Connor can ledge grab and jump high because of his strength but only to ledges that you would know can be climbed in real life. On top of that his speed can be manually controlled to create scenery almost identical to Unity if not better at times. (Watch ac3 perfect parkour videos you’ll see what I mean).
4. The graphics — most people probably still play on console but if you have a PC I highly highly recommend this game. It looks better than AC Valhalla and odyssey. Not based on texture but lighting, frame rate and environmental physics. For one, their are actual weapon pickups which no longer exist in the new game, and rag doll physics that rival gta in many ways. When you attack someone and push them they will tumble and fall but you feel how much damage is done through the screen. Even in a great game like origins, the animations are good but they suffer from the uncanny valley because it’s very difficult to simulate a rpg fully mocap combat. For example, black myth wukong would fit this category of combat, and it’s not open world for a reason. Unity tried to acomplish this but failed as the combat still has jank in many ways. But that is just one peice of the graphics. Another major graphical item would be the forest, which was clearly one of the hardest parts to design in ac3. This was before AI was used in game design to copy and paste the same textures like the rpg AC games do which is why those textures look like play dough, and why ac3’s textures almost rival AC unity’s. So since everything was placed manually and looked over thoroughly in the design of the game, it makes the forest have depth and meaning when you enter, especially with the addition of hunting which was and still is better than the new games as it actually shows you skin the animal your going to use to craft more items or sell to a store clerk. These details make the game something more, like red dead redemption 1 or gta 4, ac3 was set on making you feel like you were in that world playing as an actual assassin not a fairytale or a setting made unrealistic on purpose. It utilized the same lighting as assassins creed 1 and 2 which also shows why it was so beautiful as the Scimitar Engine used for 1 actually has the best lighting and physics out of every AC game, which explains ac3’s physics animations and fluidity.

These are just small pieces of the game still there is much more. We haven’t even cover stealth and how there are multiple play styles for the user. To end this I’ll say the reason all these points make the game the best is because the game had it all. Much like far cry 3 (and we’ll say far cry 4), AC 3 had not just changed the genre forever, but managed to surpass every sequential release after that. It has all of the old and all of the new, even more than ac4 in many cases since it still has ship combat missions with more detailed ships and realistic ship mechanics than 4 if were actually being honest for once. People hated ac3 because the glitches it had on launch or because they never tried it and skipped straight to ac4 because it has a white guy( it’s just true most kids who play ac are white anyway). Not a bad thing it but it explains why people never touched ac3. It didn’t appeal to them at the time because they couldn’t relate to a character with that much pain, maturity and character building. Now that those kids are older I’m sure they look twice everytime they see a clip of the game because they realize it might be the best one. Sure combat is easier, but compared to the hideous combat animations we have gotten from ac odyssey Valhalla and certain animations in origins or lack there of, it’s safe to say AC3 is still the best ac game.

1f92dd2,PowrOfFriendship_,2024-09-05 03:33:19,How do the Assassin's Creed DLCs work?,1,4,"I picked up almost the entire series for cheap during the Steam summer sales and a Ubisoft Connect sale earlier this year, and I've been working my way through the franchise since. I've just beaten Syndicate, and am planning on moving onto Origins soon, but have noticed the Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla DLCs are all on sale rn, so if I do plan on picking them up, I might as well do it now.

The issue is, I have no idea what I'm looking at. There are 5 different DLCs for Origins, as well as a 'Season Pass'. Based on the very limited, and very uninformative descriptions on the Store, I think the Season Pass contains all the other DLCs, but the phrase 'Season Pass' implies only for a limited time (i.e. a Season Pass to a stadium gives you tickets to that stadium for the current sports season). Is the same true for this Season Pass, and it's a subscription thing, or is it just a weird way of saying 'a bundle of all the DLC'. If the Season Pass is limited time, how long does it last? Do the non-Season Pass DLCs also have a limited time, or are they more traditional DLCs? Is all this also true for Odyssey and Valhalla?

1f8scyh,ZeroSWE,2024-09-04 20:44:14,I can't remember the last time I was this hyped for a video-game!,65,29,"Assassin's Creed is definetely one of my favorite game series. Ubisoft is excellent at creating game worlds you want to explore and live in. My favourite games in the series is Unity, Black flag and Odyssey. Three very different games that all excel in their taken on the AC formula. I really didn't enjoy Valhalla though, so I have been waiting for a long time to dive into a new Ubisoft open world game. I've tried to find other games to quench the thirst, like Far Cry but didn't like the latest one. Have instead played tons of GR Breakpoint and The Division 2 (i know, somewhat different games). 



I recently got a Ps5 and played Ghost of Tsushima for the first time. That game had so much things that I wish the next AC game would have: quicker movements, more swift stealth takedowns and weightier and snappier sword combat. And a beaufiful rendering of Japan. 



So when I first saw some glimpses of AC Shadows I got really intrigued. Finally time to go to Asia and maybe just maybe the series would learn a thing or two from Ghost of Tsushima? I liked that there were two characters where the big dude is your typical Valhalla combat character and the other can lean more into stealth. I honestly didn't dare to hope that it would be good though. Ubisoft has struggled these last years and I was so dissaspointed with Valhalla. At the same time I knew this was the studio behind AC Odyssey, whch instilled some hope. 



Then came the first gameplay trailer. Wow. Just wow. I loved Yasukes brutal and weighty sword combat and most of all, Naoe was quick and agile and the parkour seemed to have improved. I loved the attention to detail to lighting, weather and it just felt like this was the next step in AC revolution. 



Everything I have seen so far has confirmed to me that this game is right up my alley. I can't wait for November. I really hope this will be the game of the year for me. My biggest concern (especially after playing Star Wars Outlaws!) is that the game will be poorly optimised and don't run well. 



Let's hope this is the next-gen Assassin's Creed game we all have been waiting for! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1f8scyh/i_cant_remember_the_last_time_i_was_this_hyped/,assassinscreed
1f8sd8r,-SidSilver-,2024-09-04 20:44:36,New AC games should take its gameplay inspiration from an unusual place...,10,3,"... and I'm not talking about AC Shadows here, since that's obviously already in development.

These games are a strange beast. I love all the different pillars (Parkour/Exploration, Stealth and Combat) but they seem to be applied unevenly, and each games seems to over (or under) correct for one or each of the pillars in some way or another.   
  
Even as early as the outstanding Ezio games this was a problem, where Stealth really became less and less necessary and well-developed because of the slick (but bloody easy) combat. In a game about Assassins, that's kind of a shame, and I think the fits-and-starts that followed show that Ubisoft and the playerbase felt the same way. Equally though, pulling off a dozen counters and taking out a bunch of enemies with some truly *brutal* finising moves is undeniably fun, as games like Syndicate proved.

Then again, from my understanding of Mirage (I haven't played it)  they improved Stealth a bit ('back to it's roots') but screwed things up with 'powers' like the focus kills, where Basim teleports all over the place.

So what's the answer for balancing these pillars in a sort of satisfying way?

Weirdly, the place I've seen this done best is a game that wasn't popular for reasons somewhat outside it's gameplay, and that game is Splinter Cell: Blacklist.

Three playstyles are well represented here (**Ghost:** Avoiding enemies except key targets/nonlethal play, **Panther:** Taking enemies out violently and stealthily and **Assault:** Whack 'em till their dead), Fake-Sam -Fisher has an equivalent of 'Assassins Focus' that *isn't* a teleportation, but - like Mirage - builds up when you get Stealth kills.

I'm not averse to something like this in a new game, whereby it's dangerous to go full-on Assault unless you really build for it. AC should be about taking out a target and escaping, not standing there cutting down swathes of enemies. But cutting down enemies is fun! So what's the compromise?

Build up a 'Mark and Execute' that uses up resources and should really be saved for when you're cornered by two or three enemies. It doesn't need to have to teleporting all over the place to work (Assassins have variety of ranged and close combat weapons) and without it, combat against more than a couple of guards should be really quite challenging and deadly.

Features from other games would be great, too. Arkham Asylum plays with enemies fear as they get taken out, so what about using something like that?",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1f8sd8r/new_ac_games_should_take_its_gameplay_inspiration/,assassinscreed

1f86i2z,Intelligent_Paper295,2024-09-04 01:54:13,The hidden blade in Unity is confusing.  ,776,90,"Arno was the first Assassin we played since Altair to wield only one hidden blade, despite the game happening almost 600 years after Altair created the double hidden blade. 

My first thought back in the day was « yeah, alright, one hidden blade, not much of a big deal.. » until I saw the trailer in which Arno had the hidden blade attached to his right arm! In that moment, I started thinking that he might finally have 2, because, traditionally, the hidden blade was always used on the left arm, but it ended up being really just one… on the left arm? So the trailer was lying? Or did Ubisoft wanted to try something new just to come back to the classic recipe?

It’s even more confusing when we see that Thomas de Carneillon had 2 hidden blades in the prologue. In addition to that, when Arno enter the Assassin’s tunnels for the first time to meet Bellec, we can see statues representing an assassin with… 2 hidden blades. 

So, knowing that de Carneillon was Grand Master of the french Brotherhood at his time, it’s fair to assume that at one moment, they decided to go back to one hidden blade, while every Brotherhood branch of the same time period we know of (America, England…) was using the double hidden blade. 

The question is : why?

There is no logical reason I can think of right now except for wanting to « honor » the Levantine Assassins, but as far as I know, traditions don’t win fights.

It is really difficult, though, to confirm this without a proper gameplay sample.

The pretext that such mechanics would not be present in pre-Altaïr era for lore reasons never really convinced me, by the way, since air assassination itself (another lesson from Altaïr's Codex) is already present in recent games.

1f6nb82,BelaforPresident,2024-09-02 03:48:50,Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood Secret Claudia Cutscene? (Spoiler alert),0,5,"
I remember a cutscene from Brotherhood specifically from The Davinci Dissappearance DLC where after Ezio meets Claudia for asking her courtesan’s help then leaves on his mission, after it you can meet her again for a short cutscene where they talk about how Rome changed for the better after it’s liberation and Ezio says I quote “I wish only mother was here to see it” since by the year 1506 when the DLC is taking place she has already passed away.

I cannot find any evidence on this. 
I searched on google, youtube.. nothing.

The first time I’ve played this DLC was when it came out (2011 March) and after I already beat the main storyline.
-
As far as I’m concerned this can have an inpact on the gameplay, since in AC2 originally there was a huge gap between the end of 11th and the 14th sequences since the game wasn’t finished yet when it came out, so then Ubi released seq 12, 13 in the form of DLC-s, but before that, 
after the end of seq11 the player had to listen to Shaun’s (now cut) monologue in the white room (talking to Desmond) for about 1 minute on what happend in the next two seq-s which you could not “relive” back then (because wasn’t part of the game yet) for some plot reason Shaun gives to you and then the talking cuts to the “oh dear.. how could I have forgotten” part about Rodrigo.
So when you Ubi finally released and you downloaded those DLC-s Shaun or Rebeca said something to Desmond like.. “hey remember those seq-s you could not access, well.. now you can” or smth like that. 

Just sayin’ because of things like this there could be a chance for what I’m looking for here. 
Because today if you purchase AC2 you will never encounter with the long Shaun monologue. Since the PC release (2010) and especially the release of the Ezio Collection it’s not part of the game anymore. Cut forever.

So either way I need a comfirmation from the fanbase.

He has a scard face and a grizzled beard and look to his face he has two or more flintlock pistols and sword if he's in the independent war or he's got two 6 shooters and a rifle if he's in the revolution. Clothes wise he has a pantcho or sombrero has his ""cloak"" that does hidden in plane sight buff. a shirt that has different benefits of ammo or gun and armor buffs, pants that add sword or climbing buffs boots that add stealth or speed. Gloves that add ranged or melee buff. Upgrade would be his belt that he can get more for ammo that gose around his whole body and his hidden blades

1f2v7ps,Pricerocks,2024-08-28 07:13:43,Playing every main AC game part 4: AC3,16,7,"It has been quite a while since my last post, but at last I’ve finished the next step in my journey to play every AC game in order. Assassin’s Creed 3 is next on the list; this time, I played the Remastered version on PC. Although I had heard many praises for the Ezio trilogy and Black Flag, I really hadn’t heard anything about this game other than a couple story spoilers, so I really had no idea what I was getting into. I found it to be somewhat of a mixed bag, improving many aspects of the gameplay, falling flat in others, but never really reaching perfection in any. **SPOILER WARNING FOR AC3 BELOW!!!**

**The Gameplay**

Let me start this off by saying that within 15 minutes of starting this game it is very clear why this game deserved to be a numbered entry instead of having a subtitle like the previous games. We’ve taken a leap comparable to the amount of change between AC1 and 2. Absolutely everything feels different and mostly for the better— running animations feel more energetic, assassinations flow much easier, the small parkour additions like slides or running around cylinders feel like a natural evolution, the Animus map is easier to read and navigate, waypoints are visible in-game… you get the idea.
  

Combat in AC3 feels especially different from other previous entries in both good and bad ways. My first few fights were pretty embarrassing as I was slow to adapt to the new systems and button placements. I loved the fluidity of animations and especially the counters where Connor dispatched several enemies at once. The weapon selection was also pretty nice, and I mostly stuck to the tomahawk. I disliked how the targeting sometimes felt janky. I also didn’t care for how some enemies were immune to certain counter options and got guaranteed hits on me if I countered and then hit the wrong button in the heat of the moment. The worst offenders were the guys with knives who you couldn’t execute or disarm, only throw, but if you’re fighting more than like 2 people then you can’t follow up on the throw so you just kept tossing them around till the fight was over. The human shield mechanic rarely ever actually allowed me to grab someone, yet the enemies still missed most of their shots. I was also rarely able to pick weapons off the ground, which sucked because I got the impression you could get into a rhythm of shooting one guy and taking his gun to kill the next. Overall, I enjoyed the combat a hair less than the Ezio games, but all it really needed was some small nudges in the right direction to surpass them.

The parkour in this game was a decided improvement upon the already good systems of previous games. While the main mechanics all stayed the same, we got the additional bits I mentioned earlier, as well as the tree climbing that flowed very nicely. We lost a tad of the complexity with the absence of things like the vertical leaps while grabbing a ledge or ziplines, but it didn’t really bother me. My only complaint about the parkour is the viewpoints felt very samey, but that’s a common problem in this series anyways. However, the map design is far less interesting than previous games. I’m not sure if this is simply because I find the setting far less unique than other games, but every place in the cities felt the same as every other place to me. The wilderness was neat, but pretty empty. I used fast travel far more in this game than in others (and not once did I go in the tunnels outside of the story). I probably would have spent a lot more time in this game if I actually liked the enviornment.

Stealth is in a very weird place in this game. Sometimes it felt incredibly easy, other times it felt impossible. Soldiers wouldn’t see you in knee-tall grass right in front of them but would spot you on a roof in their peripherals from several buildings away. Whistling tended to attract several guards even if they were spread out, which kinda defeats the purpose because if I only had 1 guard to deal with I wouldn’t need to attract him anywhere. And none of the new items seemed especially helpful for stealth (or out of it), as neither the bow or rope dart got me any quiet kills. The new assassination animations were great though, much slicker than Ezio and Altair’s long stabs. We’re trying to be quick and quiet here!

Of course, I have to mention the elephant in the room of AC3’s gameplay– the introduction of naval gameplay. I went back and forth on how I felt about it. At first I didn’t like it at all, then after doing a couple missions my mind began to change and I was having a good time. Over time, that waned again and the last few naval missions felt like a drag. I think everything maybe felt a little too slow. You spend 30+ seconds just sailing forward before a mission really starts, and then forever trying to dodge shots while lining up your own cannon attacks, except the enemy shoots way faster than you do and you may have to duck several times before getting one shot off. I can feel the bones of something great in here but AC3 doesn’t deliver for me. Hopefully Black Flag pulls it off.

I don’t have as much to say about the other new/returning mechanics so I’ll give a couple sentences on each that I remember: The new Brotherhood system was pretty meh for me, I mostly forgot I even had them at my disposal, a huge downgrade from the Ezio trilogy. The crafting/trading were far too complicated for the meager rewards they offered (especially at the beginning when you don’t have any good items or recipes) so I didn’t even bother with it, and I had a fine time beating the game without any of the crafted items. Hell, I just remembered while writing this I never got the weapons you can buy after sequence 9 since I was locked in on finishing the story. I’m an animal lover so without the crafting incentive I didn’t partake in hunting, I probably killed around 10 animals in my playthrough. The side missions were also pretty repetitive/uninteresting, I liberated two districts, did some assassination contracts, and started a few others but never finished.

Finally, some minor things I liked and some nitpicks:

* The tutorials in this game lasted far too long, I understand that the game was basically remade from the ground up but you have to play over half of the AC3’s sequences before the training wheels come off.
* It was cool that the map opened up as I walked around instead of needing to sync with a viewpoint to have stuff I could see in front of me on the map, but also it felt like viewpoints barely unlocked any of the area around them.
* The outfit selection in this game is perfect. Even the outfits from other AC games went hard, but I stuck to changing the colors on Connor’s clothes.
* It took me like 30 minutes to climb one of the generic viewpoint trees, not sure why that one in particular was so bad other than the controls sucking since I knew exactly where I had to go.
* The graphics in this game were much improved from previous games but you could still tell it was a 2011 game with modern graphics put on top at times.
* It’s pretty funny that the pistols in this game are far worse than the guns and crossbows Ezio used 280 years ago but that’s understandable, as ranged weapons were getting pretty overpowered.
* Forts were neat, would have been better if the stealth was better.
* The rope dart seems kind of pointless.
* The horse whistle being a separate tool was annoying and lead to me wasting a lot of time scrolling to/from it.

But enough about that, let’s talk about…

**The story**

For this particular review I will discuss Connor’s and Desmond’s stories separately.

It’s hard to talk about the story of AC3 without mentioning how absurdly long the Haytham section of the game is. I didn’t get to play Connor till my 3rd session playing the game ~6 hours in, and you’re still doing tutorials at that point. I might have been more intrigued by Haytham’s story had I not accidentally spoiled myself on the twist by scrolling the subreddit after my last post here and immediately seeing a post with a title to the effect of “How did you react to the reveal of Haytham being a Templar???”. Instead, I just spent that whole time waiting for the game to reveal that information so I could get on to actually playing as the character on the cover art. However, it was a refreshing way to introduce the cabal of Templars we have to kill and give them each at least a little personality before we shank them. Haytham was an interesting character, he seemed a slightly less evil person than our usual Templars, but the brief romance between him and Ziio wasn’t even remotely believable and I strongly doubted he would be redeemed.

After a looong time, we finally move on to Ratonhnhaké:ton aka Connor’s story. His origins play out pretty much exactly the way one would expect, with his mother dying in an attack on his village, him meeting Charles Lee and the Templars and vowing to kill them, and him later setting out on a quest to find an Assassin to help him protect his village from another impending attack. This leads him to Achilles, a weary veteran who doesn’t want to train Connor but gets worn down by his persistence. There’s nothing really bad about this, it’s just very trope-y. Connor’s first interactions with the white man’s world establish him as naive and stubborn, and pissed at basically everyone outside of the homestead he meets with varying levels of justification. These traits never change. Charles Lee is also a massive bastard, I didn’t really know where to mention that. 

The story for a while plays out, once more, exactly as one would expect. Connor becomes Forrest Gump before the original Forrest is even born as he winds up at the Boston Massacre, Boston Tea Party, and Lexington & Concord. All the while, he does the usual sneaking and stabbing, stopping schemes and scratching names off of his list and fighting with Achilles constantly. None of this is really memorable except for the fact that at one point, Connor goes in and out of prison and the Templars blatantly pass on the easiest chance to kill him they could ever hope for. Eventually, his mission leads him to meet his father Haytham, and this is where the story really begins to shine. They bicker back and forth as they temporarily form an alliance, and gradually begin to respect one another’s skills. As time goes on, both of them desperately try to convince the other to see the conflict from their perspective, certain that they are right and the other will join them if they can just see reason. However, this falls apart when Haytham cheekily reveals that Washington was behind the attack on Connor's village and is planning another, and even through the shock of this revelation Connor can still plainly see that Haytham is just trying to manipulate him to his own ends, cutting ties with both of them. I seriously respect the way this game portrays Washington and the other revolutionary figures, honestly admitting that while they fought for the noble cause of the colonies’ freedom from Britain’s control, they were far from perfect, especially in their treatment of the indigenous people. I dread to think of how controversial this aspect of the story would be if the game came out today.

The third act of the game is sadly marred by some weird decision making and characters suddenly being far better or worse of a combatant than they should be. Connor returns to his village to save his people but is instead confronted by his best friend Kanen'tó:kon who has been seduced by Charles Lee. In the span of 45 seconds, Connor, an Assassin who has been trained for years by Achilles, is brought onto the brink of a fatal blow from Kanen'tó:kon, who has remained in the village that Connor left with the express purpose of training to protect his people because he couldn’t acquire the skills and resources he needed to do so in the village. Seriously, watch this cutscene on YouTube right now and take in how absurd it is for Connor to be put into this situation. Worse yet, Connor kills his best friend almost instantly, making his following angst a lot harder to take seriously. 

Then, Achilles dies. I don’t think we even knew he was especially sick before that cutscene, he just suddenly dies.

The next little while is spent on securing the loyalty of some ships to attack Fort George as a distraction for Connor to get inside and kill Charles Lee. Within 10 seconds of the attack beginning, Connor gets incapacitated by his own ships and stumbles through the fort. Within another 10 seconds of Connor saying that he needs to stay away from the guards, he ends up in a fight with Haytham that he handles with considerable ease. It doesn’t seem like there’s any realistically way Connor in a healthy condition could take Haytham in a fight but it’s actually really easy if you throw Haytham into a few objects around the area. Still, Haytham does manage to take the upper hand, and instead of just killing Connor with the literal blades on his wrists, decides to slowly choke him while monologuing about how the Templars will never lose, and **then** leaves both of Connor’s arms free, and **THEN** allows Connor to move his hand all the way to Haytham’s throat to cut it with his hidden blade. 

Shortly after, Connor (with a much cooler haircut) surrenders to Charles Lee at Haytham’s funeral. Instead of killing Connor on the spot, a mistake Charles Lee has already made multiple times, he monologues to Connor about how he’s going to ruin his life and then has a couple mooks take him around the corner so they can promptly be killed. One of the mooks tells us Charles is headed to the harbor to catch a ferry, so naturally Connor then decides to swim 200m out to board a random ship to find out where Charles is headed, then goes to the harbor to stop Charles from catching a ferry. There is a ship on fire for some reason when we get there, and after a low-energy chase through it we suddenly get one of the best exchanges in the whole of the series:

> “Why do you persist...? You put us down. We rise again. You end one plot – we forge another. You try so hard... But it always ends the same. Those who know you think you mad and this is why... Even those men you sought to save have turned their backs on you. Yet you fight. You resist. Why?”

> ""Because no one else will.""

Charles manages to slither away from even this encounter, but fortunately there is a random guy at the harbor who is perfectly willing to tell you where he went and even take you there. Finally, the two men meet in a bar and share a drink, and then Connor stabs Charles Lee to death. None of this bothers the bartender or the other patrons. Finally, Connor returns to the homestead, taking down the hatchet that signified his war against the Templars and hiding the amulet in a grave that holds a great surprise– Achilles chose the name Connor after his son who died. That got me emotional and I didn’t even really care about them.
But enough about that, let’s talk about Desmond!

I have complained in my last few reviews that the modern story has basically been shafted in favor of the past, and I think even Ubisoft finally agreed. Between the lore drops as you parkour through the mysterious cave and the missions you go on to find batteries, it finally feels like we’re actually getting something. In terms of characterization there’s not really anything to talk about– William Miles is finally given a proper introduction here but he doesn't really have anything interesting going on, and Sebastian and Rebecca are exactly the same as they were when we met them. I liked the introduction of Daniel Cross as a foil to Desmond, but he was entirely wasted as a character.

I don’t have a lot to say about the first two missions. I do really appreciate that Desmond’s sections have virtually no HUD to immersively indicate we’re not in the Animus and honestly wouldn’t mind more sections where I have to play with no HUD with a greater level of challenge. The locale of a Brazilian martial arts match is a memorably unique choice. However, the third mission suffers just as much as the third act of Connor’s story does. 

Firstly, William gets captured after he volunteers to go on a mission off-screen, which is the most predictable plot development of the whole game. Then, Miles goes straight to the Abstergo facility and murders the hell out of the shockingly underprepared guards. He gets corner by Cross who gets Deus-ex-machina’d by what seems like the bleeding effect, or some other kind of First Civ shenanigans and then is promptly killed before that can be elaborated on. Even more shockingly, Vidic then lets Desmond come straight up to him and tells Desmond to give him the apple. Reader, if your mortal enemy has an ancient artifact that can mind control people nearby when held, maybe you should not let him and the artifact near you, and if he does get near you, you definitely should not goad him into pulling it out and then activating it before anyone can react. With that out of the way, every single villain in the modern story is dead and now we can go open that vault.

Reader, I mentioned at the beginning of this mountain of text that I had multiple things spoiled for me. The other thing that I had spoiled was that Desmond dies. I did appreciate the glimpse of the future if he chose to live and the parallels both to the world of AC and the real world. What really surprised me, and maybe it shouldn’t have, was how quickly and unceremoniously the game ended after Desmond made his choice. He drops to the ground and the credits roll about 15 seconds later. I guess I should’ve seen this coming as the other games also end with virtually no denouement, but I was hoping maybe the death of the main character of the franchise would have some more emotional kick to it. RIP Desmond, you had the personality of cardboard with a smiley face drawn on it but you were still more likable than Connor.

Brief story nitpicks:

* It’s kinda crazy that we didn’t get any Achilles backstory considering the implication that the Order fell on his watch.
* The eagle sequence was pretty neat, I think I’ve heard you get to actually control an eagle later in the games.
* The only thing dumber than Ben Franklin having that insanely long speech about sleeping with older women is the fact that he repeats it every time you try to talk to him. 
* The buildup to the execution scene where you can see the Assassins working in the background was really cool.

**Conclusions and Rankings**

Firstly, if you read all that you’re a beast. I don’t know why this particular review is so long other than me having a lot to talk about. But all in all, AC3 succeeds in moving the franchise forward but fails to reach the same level of quality as its past. My rankings of the game thus far are:

1f2t9yp,Acrobatic_Attempt285,2024-08-28 05:50:11,Any word on Modern day in AC Shadows?,14,17,"I know Ubi is supposed to be “centralizing” all of their future games and basically making a real life animus, but what does that mean for modern day going forward since technically we will be the ones “accessing” the memories going forward and not a traditional character like Desmond or Layla?

If the modern day is going away, at least the playable parts and story beats that have been custom to the mainline releases(for the most part) I think thats a real travesty and another shift by Ubi away from what made this series what it was, especially after the momentum Valhalla and recent games have built with the call backs to the original story and fleshing out of the Isu lore.

I love the RPG games for the most part but I really miss when AC use to blur the lines of real history and it seemed as if we were in the middle
Of a bigger conspiracy than the Illuminati lol those subject 16 puzzles still scare the shit out of me til this day. 

Im looking forward to AC Shadows but if modern day as we know it is gone I can’t help but feel they are watering down the formula a lil too much no matter how cool this implementation of a “real life” animus may sound.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1f2t9yp/any_word_on_modern_day_in_ac_shadows/,assassinscreed
1f28gkw,Ghost_TTV_1,2024-08-27 12:27:02,My opinion on Assassins Creed after finishing every single game,280,63,"Almost 10 years ago when I was very young I beat Syndicate on my Xbox One. Now years later and I’m 17 going on 18 and I finally beat Valhalla. I’ve learned so much about life just from playing this series and I don’t think Ubisoft gets enough credit for several things. 

Firstly, the settings in this series are so unique. You truly don’t get a better historical experience than in Assassins Creed. From the Holy Land, London, Greece, and many others there’s not many games that can beat these settings. 

Secondly, I know people say that the series has gone downhill but I disagree and agree. While I do miss the older games, the RPG games have brought life to the series. I’m in love with all 3 of their settings and stories. All the games have their flaws and the RPG games I agree do have more, but they still do so much good. This leads me into my last point. 

Assassins Creed is the only triple a franchise I’ve played where I’ve found there’s good to each and every game. Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit for their effort that has conceived some true masterpieces. All these masterpieces have led me to learning one very important thing about life and their creed.

1f1w8sr,Status-Bug7380,2024-08-27 02:59:22,Playing every assassin's creed games (part 2),2,0,"Assassin's creed liberation was very interesting, I liked this was the first female assassin we played as, I liked the persona like mechanics even if it could be annoying to go back and forth at times, but I understood why they existed, and the swamp was unique even if it was clunky, however I was playing the HD version and it was terrible, the game kept crashing randomly to a point I was close to ignoring this game and moving on but kept going,

Aveline was a fine assassin, and I did like the whole idea of the Templars trying to change or hide moments by altering the memory, this game had many great ideas and was a good time, except for the crashing.


Assassin's creed 4!, my favorite assassin's creed game, I love Edward he's my favorite, he just does what he wants, and most of the time he isn't even a true assassin, which gives you this outsider perspective, yes you could say the issue of him doing good for the creed before knowing about them is strange, but I say that he did do them at different points in time, anyways, I love the ship, the shanties, the combat, I love the characters, its sad to see them all die around him, and the ending when he's with daughter was adorable, it's peak!

The only thing I could say I dislike about this game is of course everything outside, the tablet gameplay was ok at best, nothing amazing, and kinda forgettable..

Overall my favorite game alongside brotherhood.

Freedom cry was just more, this time a solo adventure with Adéwalé, to free slaves, it was a short nice time, and it wasn't a huge time sink, you can finish it in a day

It's perfectly good!


Assassin's creed rogue, the Assassin's creed game that I felt was great but also the fatigue of more of ac4 was there, I mean I just played 3 other games prior with the ships and this time we have icebergs, 

We have shay who is an assassin turned Templar, and while I like that I feel like they dumb downed the assassins in this game, made them complete assholes, and they didn't listen to any reason, I know shay isn't the most reliable person, but being there would have had more credibility then anymore else, overall exploring with shay was decent, the assassins attacking at random was alright, it was a fine time to play, even if it was written so confusing like, I do like shay however. Especially since this is a lead up to unity, and set up the story for it at the end.

Everything outside was just more of ac4 tablet gameplay and it wasn't nothing special.


Assassin's creed unity, I liked it but.
The parkour was really smooth and great but also clunky at times too, but what assassin's creed game wasn't,
Yet when it worked, wow

However I think the gameplay was bloated to be harder cause of the multiplayer mechanics, not saying it difficult or anything, you literally get the best weapon by the end of the game which makes all other weapons trivial, and you can just wreak everything grind money which is easy if you know what your doing.

Playing with other players was fun, a different taste definitely, and could be a great time, and the assassination missions were definitely a step up.

Arno was definitely just ezio, just not, and while I appreciate the attempt to capture ezio again, it just fell flat since Ubisoft doesn't do the whole multiple games per assassin anymore, so Arno is perfectly fine, I think more games would have probably gave him more time to build him up.

Also I do like the fact we were able to travel to other time periods and random, it was actually kinda cool.

The dlc sorry was a fine time, but I think too short to really have much to really think about, plus the sword you got at the end of the game was still too broken.


Assassin's creed syndicate is the last game prior to the rpg style games, it has two assassins this time, Jacob and Evie,
I like them, they are a good time, I think I like Jacob a lot for how he just want to do shit and get shit done.

The grapplehook made sense but it clearly made things trivial, and plus we can just ride a carriage now, so travel was even more less parkour and more just get in carriage and ram.

But I did like the whole gang war type of aspect even though it was half baked and kinda easy, heck the game was real easy,

Story wasn't anything too crazy too, but the final boss was strange how the twins kept getting thrown across many times

I did like how you could enter a portal and go some years into the future to one of Jacob's descendants, that was cool.

And the jack the ripper dlc was a fun time as well, especially when you played Jack.

And one big highlight was the assassinations, they were really well done here.

It was overall a good time.


After this comes origins, which I haven't played yet, but will soon and the rest, but overall I had a good time to the prior rpg games, and wonder how I'll feel about the big change from the others in origins.

I'll make my next post months later after I finished the rest, after shadow probably.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1f1w8sr/playing_every_assassins_creed_games_part_2/,assassinscreed

We all think about the Modern day right but some believe that the historical element of AC is what makes it AC, which I agree with. However, what if we could do both?

For a pure example, what if we had Tokyo Japan both in it's modern era AND when it was named Edo. This would work as your modern assassin would need to travel to the animus to locate things and find out information as to where to find things in the modern era.

Gameplay for the modern era is a worry for some people as the inclusion of assault rifles and things may ruin the assassin experience. Whilst some high restricted areas and endgame locations may feature this, I think this could be worked around easily with several features: The city could be in some kind of lockdown where guns are stripped and removed from most people and only high tech Abstergo bases have them, Gun jammers would be a good way of combatting the gun problem and act as a new gimmick also.   
Anyway, even if players don't want to see any form of gun in an AC game, they can just turn to the ""historical era"" for some classic assassin fun! 

Let me know what people think and I'm sure someone has thought of this before but idk why Ubi hasn't acted on this great idea. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1f0zuj0/how_to_do_the_next_gen_ac/,assassinscreed
1f0ujq9,Zestyclose-Level1871,2024-08-25 19:50:13,Help From Steam Users Who're Playing AC Games (Steam Launch),1,4,"I recently got around to buying the entire AC franchise (except Vahalla) on Steam in one of the massive publisher sales. I noticed the legacy AC games aka AC 2/AC Brotherhood, Revelations and Black Flag all had Steam CD keys. 

But the newer AC content aka Odyssey, Origins, Syndicate, Unity and AC3 remastered (which was bundled as a free special with Odyssey) didn't have CD keys. 

So when I try to launch any of the newer games, I get an authentication pop up window which asks me to provide the CD keys for each game. So I can't register/authenticate my UbiSoft DLC.  Steam support said they couldn't do a thing because by contract/policy with Ubisoft, they had to refer these non Steam Keys to UbiSoft.

Contacted Ubisoft tech support and asked them for my missing game keys. They refused answering my explicit request for the keys. Said they would transfer ALL the AC franchise games in my Steam library!  Is this normal? The whole reason for me buying my games on Steam, is that I want to centralize my gaming experience on a proven, well supported CS/IT support platform. Unlike a POS platform like Origin run by EA and its joke called CS support. 

So the last thing I want to do is lose control of how I can readily download my AC games (if a Ubisoft patch were to corrupt files the way EA patches typically do). A simple mouse click and Steam will revalidate all my game files after a bad patch update. Can't really do that on EA or Ubisoft platforms. 

TL DR: For those of you PC players who bought/are playing the newer AC titles like Odyssey, Syndicate etc. 

1. When you first had to authenticate your AC DLC with Ubisoft, did you have a CD key to enter into that popup window (so to finally launch your game)?

2. If you didn't have a CD key, did you get one from Ubisoft support?

3. If they didn't/wouldn't  provide you with keys, did they offer to transfer the game?

4. If #3 applies, can you no longer play/save your games in Steam cloud",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1f0ujq9/help_from_steam_users_whore_playing_ac_games/,assassinscreed

This has lead to a lot of people worrying about the structure of the story that can lead to a lack of focus. I on the other hand believe that, if done right, this could end up working really well. I think that if they focus on quality vs quantity, as in not having a gigantic amount of Templat targets to go after like Odyssey or Valhalla, and you focus on each individual target having an interesting story to tell ontop of just telling a good story in between the targets you can harken back to the days of AC1.

However, if each target is just a generic bad guy and you don’t tell a story in between those targets (like Mirage to an extent) then yeah this whole non-linear style of story just isn’t Ubisoft’s strong suit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1f07zf1/i_think_a_nonlinear_story_for_ac_cam_actually_work/,assassinscreed
1ezn02q,JoyfullyAdventuring,2024-08-24 04:32:41,Please help me figure out a way to surprise someone with a copy of Assassin's Creed Shadows before he has a chance to preorder it himself! Any help greatly appreciated <3,10,9,"Hi! Thank you in advance for any advice you may have and apologies for the wall of text:

I would really like to preorder Assassin's Creed Shadows for someone as a surprise. We've known each other a few years now/gamed in the same circles but recently had our first actual conversations and have been talking every day since (something I really look forward to - his joy is contagious and he's genuinely a delight to be around). He mentioned looking forward to the new Assassin's Creed releasing in November but being a little sad about the price, especially of some of the higher editions/preorder versions of the game, so I thought it would be a nice gift and a way to express how much I appreciate and enjoy his company. I'd really like it to be a surprise as he's been very kind and generous to me in our adventures together so far very unprompted and I'd like to show a similar level of thoughtful initiative (we play an mmo but he's a lot better at it so think things like helping out in raids I'm still working on or finding and giving me things I still need to collect).

I don't have a Ubisoft account myself but their website makes it seem like you can't gift the game to someone else on that platform anyway. Is that still the case or if I make an account with them would I be able to? If I can't gift to an existing account, would it be reasonable/allowed to make an account with a new email and just give him all the details for everything as a way to gift the game?

I do see older releases in the series on Steam but I'm a little worried that if I wait for the game to be out on Steam that the person I want to get it for will already have bought it (unless I somehow missed a preorder option in Steam?). I'd rather not ruin the surprise by just asking him to wait on buying it, especially since I think I'd want to get him an edition that lets him play earlier if at all possible.

Please forgive me if this isn't the place to post this (though I would very much appreciate being pointed in the right direction to find an answer if not)! I made my first Reddit account for this so I'm not entirely sure on the etiquette of these questions - I do see the rule on FAQ/don't ask questions that can be easily looked up but since I couldn't find a clear answer on my own I was hoping someone in the community might have more insight. I've never played an Assassin's Creed game so my context for this is pretty minimal. I saw an older post that suggested buying a code for the game for someone who couldn't buy it in the same currency as the recipient but didn't see any codes available for the preorder. I'd also be open to mailing a physical copy (if those exist?) or a code if I can get it well in advance of the online release date!!

**Tl;dr - how can I gift the new game coming out in November and would this be possible to do as a preorder?**

1ezclnd,No_Barber4339,2024-08-23 21:21:04,I forgot how fun syndicate was,113,30,"I have a soft spot for assassin's creed syndicate,  it was my first AC game that I got in a ps4 bundle with the Nathan drake collection and for a while those were the only games I played but as I recently went into the franchise and played entrys like the ezio games,  black flag and even the RPG games like origins and odyssey I was dismissive of syndicate and regarded it as a forgettable entry in the franchise 

That said,  I still had my physical copy of syndicate still around and working so I figured I could replay it again for my AC marathon 

And so it's far , it's one of the most fun playthroughs I had in the franchise. London is such a beautiful location to explore and run around in , the side quests are fun to do and doesn't feel repetitive, the carriages are a such fun addition as vehicles, parkour while it does nerf some elements from unity it's still manages to be a smooth and a fun enough and stealth is one of the best of the franchise.

I get that the grapple hook is a controversial addition to the game but I thought it was a fun addition to play around with 

Jacob and evie were a cute duo , I know that people hate Jacob for being a rash jerk at times but I do love the perspective of young assassins where they aren't your usual altair , ezio , bayek nor connor but two siblings trying to carry through their father legacy each in their own way 

I get there are some issues in the game like various bugs , some story elements and the combat but I still think syndicate deserves more appreciation for some of it's ideas that even carried over to the RPG games and it's a shame the game got dismissed due to unity's disastrous reputation 


One element I do wish carried over from unity tho is coop play with the amount of chaos you and your friends can cause all over London it's a missed opportunity for ubisoft to bring back coop despite the mixed reception it got in unity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ezclnd/i_forgot_how_fun_syndicate_was/,assassinscreed

For those who’ve been playing lately, you know exactly what I’m talking about — those weird moments where your character just shanks an enemy in the calf, hip or lower back, and they silently ragdoll to their death. It’s been a recurring bug, especially with enemies sitting, crouching, or standing above on slopes or stairs. It always looked so lazy and out of place. But here’s the thing: [the new footage showed Naoe performing a prone assassination](https://i.imgur.com/rb8Wqqz.gif), and it actually caught my eye. Instead of the usual awkward stab-and-drop routine, Naoe finishes off the fallen enemy with a more visceral and realistic stab in the heart. The animation felt way more polished and grounded. Fingers crossed this means Ubisoft is taking a proper swing at improving the animation quality and making those kill animations feel less like a glitch and more like a smooth, lethal execution.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ewvars/i_hope_this_means_ubisoft_fixed_the_broken/,assassinscreed

I am aware that there are going to be story related stuff which forces u to change character and this isn’t my problem. My problem really is that they put a character in a position where u feel forced to switch even tho they preached a lot about player choice.

In general i don’t have anything against a good challenge I would see myself even as a masochist player when it comes to gameplay difficulty and  so on I’m mostly too hot headed when it’s about difficulty and I know I can make it. But I hate the feeling when the game is obviously forcing u something when the whole time something else was told to u.

I already have in mind of how I want to play this especially since the first information we got from Ubisoft of how they are going to handle multiple characters but now hearing this just simply concerned me because I think stuff like putting naoe in a room full of brutes giving her no chance to act would be cheap asf.

It would be really cool to play as Nergui espically and even slap a DLC where you can play as Qulan Gal during the assassination of Ghenghis Khan.

Maybe some side quests like defending a caravan crossing the Silk Road or maybe even exploring the Silk Road over a huge map.

Beyond that, the online feature was also a bit clunky with some server issues. 

Beyond that- was the game really that bad?? 

I’ve been watching clips from Unity and comparing them to every game that’s released since Origins, and it’s got me (and seemingly thousands of others) realizing that Unity might’ve been the last real assassin’s creed. What does that really mean? 

-excellent parkour with unique handholds and a wide variety of climbing animations. The devs made sure to take advantage of Paris’ cramped streets, allowing the players to maneuver from the streets to the rooftops and back with a genuine flourish and style 

-the game and levels were designed with stealth in mind; some sections requiring stealth and even directly encouraging the player to run from large groups of powerful enemies 

-The environment. AC has always been (and is clearly still) passionate about lovingly recreating these periods and historically paramount cities. The devs at Ubisoft did such a phenomenal job recreating Paris that when the Notre-Dame burned down last decade, French engineers and designers literally used the 3-D model from the game to help rebuild it irl. 

Some didn’t love the story, and I agree that Arno isn’t as compelling as Edward or Ezio, but I still really enjoyed the “Romeo + Juliet” romantic/ revenge angle the game takes. I also enjoy how Arno struggles with certain facets of the Creed; adding some depth to the story and its impact. 

What do you think? Were we too hard on AC Unity? Have the new games made you reflect differently on the installments that came before?

1erkhrl,esiokles,2024-08-14 06:11:27,Naoe’s flipping animations need some work ,0,29,"So the latest parkour footage of Shadows has caused a split in the fan base. Some appreciate the flair these new animations bring to the table while others think they look too floaty.

Thing is they are cool looking but they are slowed down a bit. Ubisoft has been doing this to new parkour animations since AC3 thinking they look cooler that way and this mindset ultimately led to Unity’s parkour which while flashy is the most floaty so far.

Surprisingly enough they toned down the slow motion a bit in the rpg trilogy with a few new animations here and there and tweaked some already existing ones like the dive jump from Unity to be much faster resembling how gravity would work irl better than before.

Still the rpg trilogy introduced many animations like the heavy jumps from beam to beam that are supposed to reduce the weightlessness feeling of Unity’s animations but as a result come of as incredibly slow bringing us back to square one.

Now the new parkour footage for Naoe has two main problems. 

1) It’s reusing a lot of the animations from the rpg trilogy that don’t fit with Naoe’s new flashy animations 

2) as I mentioned earlier all flipping animations seem to be considerably slowed down just like Unity’s if not more probably as response to fan criticism of returning to that parkour system 

The solution for 1 is basically having to remake the entire parkour system from scratch(not gonna happen), something they should have already done unless they somehow remove all reused animations just before launch similarly to Mirage’s jumping animations from the E3 footage being completely different to those in the September demo.

As for 2 well, all they need to do is speed up the animations. You can see for yourselves that increasing the video speed to 1,25/1,50 does wonders to the animation realism so please Ubisoft just do it 🙏

one justification for this style that i’ve heard is that third person parkour is impossible, and it wouldn’t control nearly as well as something like Doom or Mirror’s Edge. counterpoint: Rooftops and Alleys. third person, and unlike ac, it has an actual jump button. the designs of the worlds are quite different from the denser maps of AC but it proves that third person parkour is playable

not to insult the current system, ubisoft making the entire map and the buildings climbable is very impressive technically, and some maps don’t really warrant an advanced movement system anyway (i genuinely don’t understand the people wanting to bring Unity’s parkour into Origins-Valhalla, even if it worked), but it would be nice for the parkour-action (with a hint of stealth) game to have parkour

while we’re on the topic, wall running. please. i need it. or just at least a wall jump. anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1epy6so/id_prefer_a_more_interactive_parkour_system_than/,assassinscreed
1ck29we,JanosBlueberry,2024-05-04 23:00:20,I have over 200 hours in Valhalla and I fucking hate this game,14,128,"I have over 200 hours in Valhalla. Been to nearly all regions of England. Spent countless hours in side quests, clearing map icons, River raids, fishing, and so on. I've yet to finish the main story. I still have to complete the Asgard quest line and kill several Order members. I haven't started any of the big DLC yet even tho I purchased the complete edition of the game 1,5 years ago. Still have several side quests left (Beowulf, Berserker and such).

And I'm at a point where I really start to hate this game. How the fuck is it THAT bloated. Is there even any person who actually finished everything?? This game burned me out like no other game ever did, and I played Origins and Odyssey back to back during Covid.

I still start the game once a week to claim the free item, and it always needs some time to trigger it. I'd play a bit of the main quest to progress, but at this point I can't stomach even 15 minutes of this game anymore. Every time the free item trigger is activated, I open the damn chest, claim the reward and am just relieved that I can close the game again. Last week I took the time to play 2-3 hours through the Vinland arc and it felt like the biggest waste of time ever (couldn't even keep the damn armor after all the grinding, what the fuck Ubisoft?).

I just want to be done with this game and delete it from my SSD, but it seems I will never be actually done with it.

I still think the game is beautiful, the Gameplay loop is fun and I like the whole Viking atmosphere. But seriously, Ubisoft needs to change something. Put more focus on quality content and a meaningful story again, just like in the old Ezio saga games. If AC Red is anything close to this in size, I'll stay far away from the franchise in the future (and I'm a sucker for Feudal Japan stuff in games).",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ck29we/i_have_over_200_hours_in_valhalla_and_i_fucking/,assassinscreed

1gfnicu,Lost_Celebration2676,2024-10-30 22:13:46,Valorant “mousetrap” still going strong 5 months after release,88,42,"Whats your excuse Ubisoft? You’ve had a shitty mousetrap solution for years that is easily bypassed. On top of that, if someone gets detected, they just hop into a quick match a few games and they’re back to cheating

For context, Valorant HARDWARE bans people immediately after detection, cancels the match, and refunds MMR (also don’t even get me started how much worse R6 match making is)

You have nothing to blame but yourselves for the player base dropping once again because of cheaters ruining the game for the rest of us.

Why is your entire strategy to cater to and coddle these losers? (No perma bans, weak detection, moving to PC queue for a couple games even though your detection still sucks) Because they spend money on the game? 

So short sighted. What about the majority of your player base that doesn’t cheat that will leave the game because it isn’t fun or fair to play against these losers?

Yet another bullet point in Ubisoft incompetence



EDIT: in response to the feedback about “Well almost all the top players and top spenders are cheating”, I’ll do your job Ubisoft and propose a solution:

Blast this message everywhere: social media, when you load up the game, and especially when someone gets detected: “30 day last chance period. Anyone detected using XIM after this period will face immediate ban”. Gives the cheaters time to switch to controller, and time for them to realize you will take enforcement seriously.

Half baked idea but better than whatever non-sense you guys have proposed about how putting them in PC lobbies will somehow change the cheating situation. [Hint, most aren’t using MnK on console because they don’t have a PC. They do it because they like the feeling of power they get over controller players. They will continue to bypass your shitty detection and flex on controller players]",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1gfnicu/valorant_mousetrap_still_going_strong_5_months/,Rainbow6

I also observed that after each frame drop, I experience **high jitter/ping** and **packet loss**. I don't understand how to fix this. I have watched a lot of videos and guides, but nothing has changed.

My PC components:

* i5 7400
* GTX 1060
* 2x4 GB RAM
* 1920x1080 monitor
* 100GB SSD with the OS
* 1TB HDD with 600GB free space

I use Process Lasso to keep Ubisoft **processes at low priority** and **restricted to just 1 core** (the 4th core) (processes affinity).  
I set RainbowSix\_BE.exe to low priority and restricted it to just 1 core (the 4th core).  
**Background apps** are **disabled**.   
In Windows graphics settings, I have **R6** set to **high performance**.  
I have the **latest Nvidia drivers installed**.   
The **60 FPS limiter is set**.   
I downloaded the game **from Steam**.   
I used to play Dead by Daylight, Black Ops 2 and 3, and Fortnite without any problems.  
Using **DX11, DX12, Vulkan** (I think there is no more), **same problem**, maybe Vulkan was a little better, but I do not really know.  
I do not have enough money to upgrade my components.

1gd3seg,InternationalLog8532,2024-10-27 13:15:02,"The idea for a new Siege ""Siege 2"" please read before giving feedback and also show support if you support the idea.",0,20,"Siege 2 should not follow the same path as the development of Overwatch 2 and CS2. Unlike those games, Siege 2 does not need a sequel created without community input. If Ubisoft does not engage with players, Siege 2 risks becoming a failure. Instead of simply creating a new game, they should focus on changing aspects that the community wants. This could include adding or removing items, transitioning features from old to new (or vice versa), and even incorporating glitches that have historically benefitted the game rather than harmed it.

Ubisoft needs to actively listen to player feedback throughout the development process. Creating polls to gather community suggestions and allowing players to vote on features—like a spawn point from a helicopter or an opening cinematic similar to the release trailer—would be beneficial. Additionally, revamping the graphics with new engines will enhance visual quality and performance, making the game smoother while adding or removing elements based on community votes.

A well-functioning anti-cheat system is essential for maintaining a fair gaming environment. It must be thoroughly tested to ensure it effectively targets the right issues and responds quickly. The recent anti-cheat patch is a step in the right direction, addressing hackers, XIM users, and ensuring compatibility across both console and PC. If these features were implemented more effectively, it could have made a significant impact on the game's integrity.

The ranked system could also see a transformation into “Ranked 3.0,” where players earn exclusive rewards, such as cosmetics, for each tier. This would make progression feel meaningful. For example, players who are only slightly into a rank should not be considered the same as those at the maximum rank. Moreover, the regular leveling system needs work. While receiving an alpha pack each time you level up is a good start, adding a feature where every ten levels yields a token for a skin from a selection of alpha packs or a significant amount of renown could enhance player experience. Additionally, incorporating XP boosters, similar to renown boosters, would be a welcome improvement.

Furthermore, the marketplace should be integrated into the game itself, eliminating the need to visit a website. Players should have access to their entire skin inventory from Siege 1 in Siege 2. Purchases could allow for choices between using skins in Siege 1 or 2. Certain items could be exclusive to one game or the other, depending on community preferences.

Pricing is also crucial. If Siege 2 is more affordable—around $15—it would be accessible to a broader audience. Players who own Siege 1 could receive a discount, such as 20%, or even get Siege 2 for free, they could also add some exclusive items to players accounts if they played siege 1 

In conclusion, for Siege 2 to thrive, it must prioritize community input by implementing polls during development, improving graphics, revamping the ranked system, enhancing the leveling process, and making the marketplace more user-friendly. Listening to player suggestions and considering past ideas that were well-received will ensure the game meets the community’s expectations and desires.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1gd3seg/the_idea_for_a_new_siege_siege_2_please_read/,Rainbow6

My husband and I just got back from a 3 week vacation in Japan and while we were there all his socials were hacked. He managed to get everything back except his instagram. However, when we got home the first thing he did was get on Xbox to play Siege with his friend just to find out his Ubisoft account had been hacked. He is completely devastated and I feel terrible. He has played Siege since it has came out and he had tons of rare skins and things that he was super proud of. Now, he’s debating quitting gaming all together. He’s emailed Ubisoft support but told me that they never respond or reach out so it’s probably gone for good. Is there anything at all we can do? Or anything I can do to help him? I really want to get it resolved, as it was one thing he was very proud and passionate about.

I used to play on XBOX and 4 years ago I switched to PC, when they added cross-save I requested for my 2 accounts to be merged along with their inventory ( NOTE: obsidian skin was missing on xbox too, haven't seen it since Operation Health ), this did not help as that skin is still missing to this day.

I opened several support tickets and after many attempts they finally decided to merge my 2 accounts again in order to fix the issue (idk how that should work but ok ig), yesterday I answered saying the skin was still missing, and after giving proof of the purchase for the 4th time, they answered by saying: 

'' After checking upon your request, we're sorry to inform you we are not able to proceed with your request anymore. Note we are not able to give any information related to this situation.''. 

This is CRAZY since that's a product I PAID FOR and that's been missing for several years without them giving a single care about why that even happened. And now they're refusing to help and to explain the reason of their decisions. I don't even think this is legal.

Let's just say, It's unpredictable, yet still Chaotic as usual.

• How many times will I see & hear constant racism?

• Why does everyone expect you do get 10+ Kills minimum to speak, when they beg for Callouts?

• Why do people rally against 1 player, Berate the life out of them, because they had a bad game?

• Why do people act like Elitists, screeching about the wrong things, while blaming whoever they place their anger on?

• Why must people Team kill a Player who has the Battlepass? Geeze, Go back to banning them then. I'd rather be alive and Play.

• Why can't Seige players behave?

• Why are Seige players the only breed of Human, to ever be Offensive for fun?

• Is everyone abusing Shields and Exploits now?

• Why is 80% of the playerbase, Crazy? Not ""Haha"" crazy, but actually lost their minds? I haven't seen a lobby, not talk about Sex or Drugs in weeks.

• Appearantly, not having a Mic is Greifing, So I got reported for it on one match by 3 people.

• I also got reported, for someone else having a 4 squad. So yes, I was reported for being solo.

• I got reported Thrice by a 2 man squad, for being ""Handicapped"" then ""Black"" soon after ""American""

• Fourth match I got reported for not getting any kills. Yet I was the only player reinforcing, Droning, Pinging, destroying gadgets, etc. As my teammates refused any of the work, + constantly rushed + Called me ""Psycho"" for wanting less angles.

• Why is this game, innately stressful?

• Turned on Voice chat for the first time in 9 years. a friend said they'd pay me $5if i did. Will genuinely wait another 15 years before turning it on again. Yikes.

• am I just the Unluckiest Seige player ever?

• I hope the Doktor's curse gets cured. Man is that mode frustrating. Fun, but damn.

• I hope trapping a person under a desk is bannable In Doktor's curse.

• what the hell is a ""Gyatt"" ? And why the hell am I going to get smoked by one, because I went Amaru?

• who the hell is Carlos??? A new meme?

• Does nobody know how to use Ying? I swear, Imma go blind IRL with how many times my teammates hit me with a Candela.

• Teamwork and Cordination don't exist.

• After about a few days of the update going live, I finally got some good matches in. Only to be met with -134RP, as my teammates were cheating. Can I never win, even when I do win?

• My reputation went from Esteemed to Disruptive, this Season. I've never once had it drop this low. Great. I haven't changed anything.

• Will I forever be stuck in Copper? I barely have enough time to play as it is. It's hard out here for a Solo only player, but man these people make it so much harder.

• I was told to basically Harm myself, because I Got spawn peeked twice from different locations, as the enemy was not pinged outside.

• I've had about 2 Decent matches thus far. No drama, actual people with self respect, and could play to play. Not treat it like a Job, or Asset to show off.

[Final words]
Honestly. Even the Battlepass isn't worth the money, let alone any serious investment into this game anymore. Memberships are a Complete Scam to profit on what is left of the game's popularity, to help Ubisoft's bottom line float before they hit bankruptcy. 
I rarely ever buy extra content at all, unless it holds it's worth. There is very little to praise here. The only noteworthy thing, is me finally being able to unlock the last operator. I could've grinded months for, without spending $10.
I don't think I'll be buying the battlepass again.
Why buy it, when other games give back enough premium currency to continue the Battlepass for the Next season? 600 Credits back, is an Insult.

Reason 3: His secondary loadout is pretty cool, and could be even cooler with shields. (He would be the only classic shield op with a shotgun)

Reason 4: it would give shield enjoyers another option on defence other than clash (who isnt really a shield op in the traditional sense anyways)

Reason 5: putting a classic shield on defence, combined with a gadget that excells at taking down shields will give defence a better chance to counter shields in end game, post plant, and 1 v 1 scenarios.

1g9g46k,WholesomeSnugglesOwO,2024-10-22 19:45:35,Fanmade Rework Concepts! ,0,4,"Fanmade Rework Concepts!

To preface, I know damn well these are horribly flawed and will never be possible. I am lightyears far from being a competitive player, and as such take all of these with a bucket of salt. If they were good reworks, i’d be on Ubi’s Balancing Team, not posting on Reddit.

Reworks:

Shield Rework
	⁃	Shields no longer completely block bullet damage. Instead, they will only completely block weaker bullets (<30 DMG) and higher caliber weapons will have a chance to penetrate the shield based on their destruction properties, and their damage is reduced. (Example: 40 dmg becomes 16 dmg, 70 dmg becomes 49). 
	⁃	Bullets that cannot/fail to penetrate a shield greatly slows the shield user down.
	⁃	Currently it is no fun fighting against shields, especially Blitz. This change now makes shields more realistic and encourages shield players to be more careful of who to rush. This rework also comes into play with some of the operator reworks below.

	⁃	Shields now swing either left or right upon being melee’d or blocking explosive damage.
	⁃	This theoretically wouldn’t affect most shield players, but adds a fun gambling aspect to those who try and look sideways upon being melee’d. Now they’ll have to guess which way their shield will swing, and either they’ll get it right and block damage or completely expose themselves and die.


Operator Reworks:

Sledge:
	⁃	Sledgehammer’s destruction is nerfed and becomes Sledge’s melee. Sledge’s melee can break soft surfaces similarly to Aruni but a lot stronger.
	⁃	This way his iconic ability is retained and fits his brawny character

	⁃	Sledge’s ability is changed into a Dash similar to Oryx’s dash, but utillises his hammer to make contact fatal. Cannot jump vertically.
	⁃	Dashing through soft walls creates a similar effect to Nomad’s Airjab if an enemy is close enough to the wall being broken.
	⁃	Theoretically this would make him a fun operator to rush in and murder the siteholders, punishing them for not reinforcing walls properly. His extra HP pool is essentially sacrificed to use his ability, making him a sewer slidal Ash alternative.

	⁃	Sledge is given a Shield. Using his Dash with a shield negates the damage he would otherwise take from breaching. Dashing against an enemy would knock them down as opposed to killing them.
	⁃	In tandem with the shield adjustments, running a Sledge with a shield allows for a slightly more conservative yet still violently aggressive approach to using him. 


Thermite
	⁃	Breach Charge deploying speed is greatly increased
	⁃	Breach Charge activation time is marginally decreased 
	⁃	(Not really sure how to explain this accurately) Makes it easier to be Bandit tricked, making it harder to breach from outside. In return, it is a lot less risky now to breach when already inside the building thanks to the increased deploying speed.
	⁃	Hopefully would encourage more people to try and learn Bandit-Tricking.

	⁃	Add the M4 to his arsenal
	⁃	A viable alternative to the 556XI


Fuze
	⁃	Cluster Charge’s damage and explosion radius is greatly decreased 
	⁃	Cluster Charge deploying speed greatly increased
	⁃	Clusters launched, launching radius and launching speed is doubled.
	⁃	This would change the way the Cluster Charge is used. Instead of it being fatal but situational, it becomes a device that wreaks havoc in-site but less likely to be fatal. 


Montagne
	⁃	Montagne’s shield will normally block all bullet damage and works like a regular shield when extended.
	⁃	Montagne will now automatically Red Ping where an enemy is if they deal damage through his shield to him, ideally with a voiceline asking for help.
	⁃	As far as i’m aware, Monty has always been alright as an operator, but heavily reliant on teammates and coordination to be effective. This rework would simultaneously make it more helpful to the team with intel and make him more viable when he’s left alone. The shield rework would also remove his ability to cower in a corner covering the defuser, encouraging a less idiotic strategy.


Blackbeard
	⁃	New ability: Integrated Gun
	⁃	Blackbeard’s new ability and primary is a unique shield that has a slot for his gun, allowing him to shoot without moving away his shield. Aiming will still move his shield away however.
	⁃	Blackbeard’s shield is slightly smaller than regular shields, leaving half of his thighs exposed when standing and his feet exposed when crouching. The gun slot does not block bullets.
	⁃	Blackbeard’s shield is slightly weaker than other shields, but in return is slightly more agile. Blocks less explosive damage.
	⁃	Blackbeard is very sentimental to me, being the operator I used the most when I was just learning the game. I figured along with my concept of a shield re-work, i’d give him a new ability based on said rework since it is similar in nature to his TARS Shield.

	⁃	New Sidearm: ST-2xel
	⁃	A machine pistol (if you can call it that) based off his MK17 CQB with it’s stock removed, a shorter barrel, lighter body and removed sights. (Higher mobility, lower accuracy, no ACOG)
	⁃	A fully automatic alternative to the D.50, both being terrifying to fight against when combined with his shield. With this rework, (similarly to his previous ability) he essentially does not have any special abilities, but is borderline unbeatable in a regular gunfight.


Blitz
	⁃	~~limbs are sawed and torn off~~ Stun duration is greatly decreased.
	⁃	His shield is a glorified flashlight. I never understood how it stuns the same way a stun grenade would. This adjustment also makes 1v1s a lot more fair.

	⁃	Added Stun Grenades to utilities. 
	⁃	As compensation for reducing his shield stun, he receives traditional Stun Grenades. In theory, this allows him to flash an entire room before rushing in and playing off his initial flashes.

	⁃	Adds slight resistance towards stuns 
	⁃	Similarly to Ying, this would make it easier to play off his initial flashing. 


Osa
	⁃	Her shields are subject to the same rules as ballistic shields, and additionally have a HP pool. Shield is broken once HP pool is depleted.
	⁃	Shooting the shield with small firearms will splinter the shield, making it harder to see. Shooting with a round that penetrates the shield splinters the shield similarly to if it was melee’d. 
	⁃	It makes no sense how invincible her shield is, considering that it’s glass. I don’t think any see through material is completely bullet proof.

	⁃	Shield amount is increased 
	⁃	I don’t have Osa unlocked, so I could be wrong, but I believe she carries 3 shields. Now that her shields are a lot more destructible, she in return carries more of them, maybe 4 or 5.

I played the Splinter Cell games in the past but probably not all. I definately liked them and I recall a DLC called Kola Cell which I very much liked as well.

What made me excited about the games at that time were the great graphics, the varied and impressive settings, the gameplay and these were atmospheric for me.

If I then look at Ghost Recon, what I like about them, great gameplay mechanics, big and varied and lively map (Wildlands) which was a joy to explore, I can drive, fly … a lot freedom to move around and certain freedom to solve the missions. A great fundament for a great agent game.

I want a Ghost Recon with the strength the series has plus what made Splinter Cell great for me.

Did Ubisoft just give up partway through development on this? Don't get me wrong, there are some things that I'm already loving about the game, it's just that there's a lot that I am not. What's the point having so many perks if you can only use three at any given time? Why does my character phase through stairs so much? Why only allow 1 class at a time, when 2 would allow greater freedom for the player while still limiting the character to a certain role? Why does my character struggle to turn around/take 3 miles to do so when I'm  right next to a cliff? Why can't my character walk over rocks on a mountain side without stuttering like early PUBG? What's the point in my AI reviving me if I can't move to get to cover? At least Wildlands gave you 2 seconds of invulnerability after reviving, Breakpoint says no you stay dead. My favorite is how I shot down a helicopter, but the wolves on board shot at me while it was falling, knocked me back, and because I was on one of the parachuting dock thingys, I promptly fell to my death. And so I must ask, Why? Does it get any better with progress?

1gc3mex,Ghost_Leader07,2024-10-26 04:15:32,This represents when Ubisoft was an elite. ,121,7,"As someone who grew up playing ubisoft games, this period (1994 - 2003) in my opinion was ubisoft's peak, nostalgia aside that logo meant something back then, don't get me wrong they made arguably some of their best titles all the way up to early to mid 2010s then things  started to shift, their business model became a business first and a good product second.

As of right now they pretty much ruin the whole Tom Clancy's name and the only ""survival"" of these titles is Ghost Recon and maybe Rainbow Six. I'm not even sure if Ghost Recon gonna survive for much longer if they don't make major changes, their push for evey game to be an open world +100 hours drag is mainly what ruined the majority of their best IPs, no one is asking for my opinion but I'll give it anyway, Ghost Recon needs to return to its original formula a tactical shooter with fixed missions, here's an example: Future Solider, it may not be the best GR game but it brought something new to the series, it was definitely ahead of its time. 

They knew they couldn't push Splinter Cell to the open world style so they dropped it or shall I say put on ice because they don't know what to do with it, probably because they're so tunnel visioned at the sales numbers above all forgetting that a good game sells. 

This might sounds like a little rent but honestly I'm a bit saddened to see some of our favorite franchises going to waste due a bad business model or a bad management of a company that is solely driven by greed. 

There's a great identity behind Ubisoft they just need to find it in order to recover otherwise it'll be far gone and irreversible. ",https://i.redd.it/jt45nwq6nywd1.jpeg,GhostRecon

Combine that with the fact that the open-world Ghost Recon games aren't exactly the biggest hits of all time (why that is, beats me), and you’ve got the perfect storm for almost no mods being made for this game.

If I could suggest one mod, it’d be a randomized enemy count per location. I've put in so many hours that I know exactly how many enemies are at a lot of locations, which makes even Extreme Ghost Mode a breeze.

The fact that enemies have routines—eating, sleeping, patrolling, etc.—is brilliant, a fantastic feature. But even that becomes predictable after a while.

Maybe the mod could make it so a base that typically has, say, 20 enemies gets 3 different versions: a low garrison, the standard garrison, and an extra-heavy garrison (like doubling the enemies) or just something simple like x5, x10 enemy spawns.

I always found it bizarre that bases like M.O.B. Condor & M.O.B. Jaguar weren’t overflowing with enemies.

1fwk1i0,GnarlyAtol,2024-10-05 14:19:21,Operation Motherland … a second try …,0,4,"Hi,

just replayed Wildlands campaign a 3rd time … what a wonderful map despite the dated graphics. I enjoyed it.

So, 2 days ago I decided to give Breakpoint a second chance as result of frustration with Division 2 game development.

Created a new character in Breakpoint and … it took me a while to find out where to start OM with the new character lol … how can a menu that confusing?

Agents, a “realistic“ tactical agent game is all I want. I don’t want Division with current gameplay, Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Avatar, Star Wars, XDefiant, the stopped Heartland or any other of the Ubi games but I want a good Ghost Recon and would be willing to buy all potential expention DLCs.

BUT Breakpoint … it’s impossible for me to like the game. Sure, the “Ingenieurs“ menu is a minor thing but it starts already with the blurry and unsharp graphics on One X and Series X … it’s a relieve returning to RDR2, Division 2 and even the old Division 1. Next GR graphics must me on par with other top games at time of release.

By no means I will play the campaign of the base game a second time but started now OM again.

I appreciated that they added the option to reduce the robot stuff but found out that this is inactive in OM and that they added other robot shit and the super annoying drone stuff … why?

Why I can’t change enemy difficulty in OM? These are so spongy … stealth kills with silencers are partially not possible and the attacked NPCs which digested my full clip wakes up all other NPCs …

On top comes the so boring and outdated looking mission design. Comparing the mission visuals with the way older Division 1 mission visuals, texture and rich details … 
it’s like looking at a 10 year older game.

The first area in OM is the one with the city … a dead city … comparing this with Wildlands … what was going in the minds of the developers ….

… it’s impossible to like this game and to force myself to continue playing …

I hope they do the next one right!

Ghost Recon has the gameplay fundamentals for a great game … 

I hope latest customer questionnaire initiative by Ubi will help!

So we have 2 different settings that seem to have been leaked for the next Ghost Recon game. Obviously, nothing officially confirmed by Ubisoft themselves at this point in time and one or both could be completely wrong. I just thought it'd be an interesting topic to discus as to which setting people would prefer.  

The first is Ghost Recon Project [OVER](https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-recon-project-over-details/). Tom Hemderson had originally said the game was going to be a ""fictional Naiman war"", so we all assumed it to be set in regions of Mongolia and Kazakhstan. However, his article that went more in depth into the next Ghost Recon game stated it to be set in a ""hostile Southeast country.""

There is obviously some confusion as to the setting that has been leaked online.

1fliaqb,Rain-D,2024-09-21 01:59:27,[Bug] Conquest mode co-op - Optic Camo is missing after Host's game crashed and restarted,2,2,"Good day to All,

I've already asked Ubisoft support regarding the issue, but they stated ""too many requests - expect delays with answers"". I will post here their solution for the issue (if any) as soon as they respond.

Steps for reproduction (my case):  
  
1) Playing game on laptop with lid down and regular screen attached.  
2) Start game as a host. Game in Conquest mode.  
3) My Wife joins me.  
4) During first play of Optical Camo mission - I've opened a cache with Optical Camo and got UI addition with default U button near Pistol.  
5) Got an issue with BT keyboard - keyboard didn't work - only mouse working.  
6) Opened laptop lid - game tried to minimize itself and crashed.  
7) My Wife remained in session - and on my advice left in correct way.  
8) Restarted laptop + windows + started Ghost Recon Breakpoint again.  
9) Invited my Wife again. Mission status reverted (as if we didn't open a cache).  
10) Followed mission and opened a cache again.  
11) My Wife has Optical Camo and it is working.  
12) I don't have Optical Camo - No button, no Optical Camo section in UI, no ""U"" button working.  
13) Restart of the game, switch roles host-guest didn't help.  


TL:DR Optical Camo is lost after game is restarted due crash mid-mission after Optical Camo was picked up.

It seems that there is conflict with character's global flag ""camo picked-up"" and whole mid-mission restart.

If you have experienced and fixed this bug - I would like to know. 

Till this moment I've seen suggestions to restart Conquest mode (will do after response of tech support). And delete and create new character (won't do - as I'm not replay-type of gamer).

## Season 2.0

Seasons were introduced to The Division 2 in March 2020 with the release of Warlords of New York. They have become a key aspect of the endgame, however, after four years, this model has reached its limit. To prepare for the game's future, they needed to reevaluate the season model, update it, and equip the game with the right tools to make each season truly unique. 

TU 22 & Seasons 2.0 offers an exciting mix of new gameplay elements, new story, and rewards, all presented in a fresh way that allows for greater creativity and surprise. The main idea behind Seasons 2.0 is to break away from the current seasonal model by transforming the entire experience. 

&nbsp;

### Seasonal Journey Missions

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season’s content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

### Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

&nbsp;

### Manhunt Scouts

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

&nbsp;

### Seasonal Modifiers

=> [Season Modifiers]( https://i.imgur.com/XfduRhn.png)

The Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience.

The modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges.

&nbsp;

###Season Pass 

The optional Season Pass is available for all The Division 2 players starting at Level 1, priced at 1000 Premium Credits ($9.99 or your regional equivalent) in the in-game store and does not require ownership of the Warlords of New York DLC. While accessible from Level 1, please note that the rewards remain locked until Level 40.

Additionally, players can opt for the Premium+ option, available for 3000 Premium Credits ($29.99 or your regional equivalent), which bundles the Premium Season Pass with multiple rewards, offering even greater value.

&nbsp;

=> [SeasonPass]( https://i.imgur.com/BurFjAY.png)

&nbsp;

Players with the Season Pass can gain access to the following premium track rewards: 

*   10 gear dyes
*   10 weapon skins 
*   2 outfits 
*   2 new Prestige Arm Patches

&nbsp;

Moreover, players can earn 400 Virtual Currency by progressing through the Season Pass on the premium track.

But that's not all! Free players now can receive cosmetics in the Season Pass. The free track includes 1 outfit and 1 weapon skin, allowing every Agent to gear up and stand out in the streets of D.C.

##New Gear

This season introduces two new Named Weapons and several new Talents, along with a new Gear Set and Brand Set. Exotic collectors can look forward to a new Exotic Assault Rifle, an Exotic Holster, and an exclusive Exotic Chest Piece awarded for completing the Climax Mission. 

###Gear Brand Set - Legatus S.p.A.

##Balancing Pass

###Rework

**Sledgehammer** - Weapon Talent

Dealing damage with a grenade applies a mark on target. Targets with marks will take **15%(20%) more damage to armor** and have a -20% movement speed. Mark disappears after 10 seconds.  
  
_Previously: Dealing damage with a grenade applies a mark on target. Targets with marks will take 30% more damage to armor and have a -20% movement speed. Mark disappears after 10 seconds._

&nbsp;  

**Mosquito Song** - Exotic Pistol

Hitting an enemy applies a stack. Stacks are shared between players. At **5** stacks, the enemy will forcefully target the last player to apply a stack for 5s **and take 25% more damage to armor**. Stacks deplete every 5s. Activating the effect on an enemy will remove all stacks from other enemies.

&nbsp;  

###Rifles and MMR's become fully automatic

With TU22 these Rifles and Marksman Rifles are now fully automatic:

&nbsp;  

**Rifles:**

*   ACR
*   UIC15
*   The Ravenous
*   M1A
*   Lightweight M4
*   LVOA-C
*   MDR
*   Resolute Mk47
*   Mk17
*   SIG 716
*   USC

&nbsp;

**MMR’s:**

*   G28
*   Mk20
*   SVD

&nbsp;

### Balancing - Weapons & Talents, Gear & Brand Sets, Exotic Weapons & Gear

With the introduction of Seasons 2.0, which brings new features like Modifiers, Scouts, Priority Objectives and the Seasonal Journey, we’ve taken a fresh approach to balancing, aiming to give different playstyles more distinct personalities.

This update will address a wide range of elements, including various weapon categories, Exotic weapons and gear, weapon mods, talents, and gear sets.

&nbsp;

### Loot Pool Update

In TU22, a fresh batch of Named Weapons will be added to the loot pool for missions and mission bosses. While the original loot tables remain unchanged, they now offer additional opportunities to obtain these new items.

Although these weapons have a higher drop rate, they are not guaranteed rewards and may require multiple attempts to acquire. The likelihood of these weapons dropping increases with the difficulty level of the mission.

These new loot drop chances are exclusively available for characters at level 40 or above and are limited to regular versions of missions - they do not apply to ""invaded"" missions.

#Shades of Red

Year 6 Season 2: Shades of Red is marking the start of a new seasonal journey. With Aaron Keener in custody at the White House, he aims to strike a deal with The Division. Before Agents can learn what he knows, they have to secure the other members of Keener's team, starting with Theo Parnell.

&nbsp;

***
##SEASONS 2.0

###Seasonal Journey

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season's content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

###Seasonal Modifiers

=> [Season Modifiers]( https://i.imgur.com/XfduRhn.png)

The Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience: 

*   **Global Modifiers** set the overall theme of the season and are active at all times while the system is enabled, affecting the core gameplay loop. 
    *   This season, the theme is ""range."" The Global Modifier, ""Point Blank,"" grants a bonus damage based on distance from enemies. 
*   **Active Modifiers** function like ""ultimate"" abilities, giving your character a short burst of power. 
    *   Players can choose from a selection of Active Modifiers, but only one can be equipped at a time. This season, they manipulate the range zones set by the Global Modifier. 
*   **Passive Modifiers** work in conjunction with the Global Modifier, adding extra bonuses. 
    *   Players can equip up to three Passive Modifiers simultaneously. In the first season, these modifiers provide additional benefits based on the range zones from the Global Modifier. 
*   **Hostile Modifiers:** These represent how the enemies adapt to your new abilities. 
    *   As players progress through the season, enemies will gradually gain new abilities linked to specific enemy types, forcing you to use the Global, Passive, and Active Modifiers strategically to counter them. 

The modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges. 

&nbsp;

###Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

Players can choose from three objectives, selecting one based on limited information such as duration, reward category, and mission type. Once a selection is made, it is locked in, and the full details of the objective and its rewards will be revealed.

If none of the objectives appeal to the player, the system allows for rerolls and has an Abandon Objective feature. Players can earn reroll points by completing Priority Objectives, with a maximum of three rerolls stored at any time.

There is no limit to the number of Priority Objectives a player can complete, and rewards include XP, Season Pass XP, items, resources, and passive modifier unlocks.  

&nbsp;

###Manhunt Scouts

=> [Parnell Manhunt](https://i.imgur.com/khEGjlR.jpeg)

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

Each week, players can tackle a Scout, which consists of three different activities. These activities will vary, and players must solve a small riddle to complete each one. Activities should be completed in order, and once all three are finished, players will receive the Scout Reward.

Once all activities in a Scout are completed, players will receive a bigger reward, including a unique collectible. However, new Scouts cannot be accessed until the current one is completed.

By the end of the season, completing all Scouts unlocks the Manhunt Climax Mission, and finishing that unlocks the Master Climax Mission, so make sure to stay on track each week.

&nbsp;

***
##GEAR, WEAPONS & TALENTS

=> [Shades of Red Trailer]( https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2287662980?t=0h0m14s)

This summary only covers the delta of what is already listed in the patch notes. 

&nbsp;

##Revisit Seasonal Modifiers

The goal is that each season is unique, and replaying an entire season with a modifier that you already know is also not something they think is fun for players that participate in every season. But what could happen is, that they bring a modifier back for a time-limited event – similar to the Throwback Event that we just had. 

&nbsp;

##Master Difficulty

Will only be applied to the Climax Mission of the Manhunt and not any other mission. 

It is a handcrafted experience that is intended to be hard in the area between legendary and incursion difficulty. 

&nbsp;

##Twitch Drops

=> [Image]( https://i.imgur.com/8F7O8fT.jpeg)

There will be a Twitch Drops campaign between October 29th and November 12th where you can watch Twitch Streams and earn multiple rewards. 

&nbsp;

## Friend Referral

=> [Insurgent Outfit]( https://i.imgur.com/rzbskrp.png) / [Backpack]( https://i.imgur.com/AnPT7xX.png)

As of October 31st, there is a new Friend Referral Program active. The old Stinger Hunter Outfit is still there for new players, but there is now also a second outfit. When you invite a player into the game, you get a new “Insurgent” outfit and backpack as reward. 

The main goal is that you do it again and not just once. You can also invite players back that have stopped playing. So, for example, when you bring back a player that had their last play session before June 2024, you can also get the reward.

The goal is to update the Friend Referral Program as we go through the seasons. 

&nbsp;

##Apparel Collection – S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

This apparel collection will become available in the in-game store later in the season.

## Halloween Giveaway

=> [Image]( https://i.imgur.com/S4jEVpg.png)

To celebrate Halloween, there will be a “Laughing Gas” Bundle giveaway on the official The Division channels (Discord / Twitter) and participating creators. 

It will also be available in the store. 

&nbsp;

## Special Events

During the season they are also planning further special events. As of now we don’t have specific dates: 

* Winter Event
* More XP Events

More details to follow.

&nbsp;

## Q&A

**Will there be an Apparel Event this Season**

At the moment they are not planning an Apparel Event this Season. The idea is to reward apparel items through other ways – like special events – and not just the grind of an Apparel Event. 

&nbsp;

**Are seasonal characters still a thing**

You can play the Seasonal Journey with a level 1 character, but it is not required. So, you can play with your level 40 character. 

&nbsp;

**More Legendary Missions**

Not planned at the moment, since they were intended for Strongholds only, but maybe down the road. 

&nbsp;

**Extra character slot*

No, that is no longer planned. 

&nbsp;

**Brooklyn DLC Information**

Will be revealed when it is ready. 

&nbsp;

**New Raids / Incursions**

Not planned at this point – but maybe down the road. 

&nbsp;

**New Conflict Map**

Not planned at this point. 

&nbsp;

**Is Faye Lau still alive**

NO

&nbsp;

**Crossplay?**

Not on the table at the moment. 

&nbsp;

**Global Events in Division 1**

They are a small team and they have prioritized Division 2. While some people have been working on it to bring the Global Event back, it is very difficult to make any changes to Division 1 at this point. 

&nbsp;

**Raid Exclusives on Master Difficulty**

Raid exclusive Exotics remain raid exclusive. 

&nbsp;

**Blueprints from old seasons**

The goal is to make them available. 

&nbsp;

**Revisit Descent**

At this point they know what is working with the game mode and what does not, and while they want to revisit Descent, it is not planned in the near future. 

&nbsp;

**Multiple Exotics**

Exotics are balanced so that you can equip only one at a time. When you want to equip multiple Exotics, they have to be nerfed, because you would give you too much power. 

&nbsp;

**Descent Audio Logs**

There will be new collectibles with this season and they are looking into ways to make the old ones accessible. 

&nbsp;

**Monetize backpack trophies and arm patches**

There are no plans to add those to the store, since they were part of those seasons. 

&nbsp;

**Collaborations with other Ubisoft Titles**

They are also in discussions with other Ubisoft titles – not just external partners - what they could do that fit the Division. But no announcement at this point. 

&nbsp;

**New Faction in the game**

A new faction is a lot of work, because it also requires new behavior, new looks and new challenges and that is not in scope at this point. 

&nbsp;

**More Clan Members**

Nothing is planned at this point, but they want to revisit clans. 

&nbsp;

**Gear Mods rework**

They know it is not a good experience.

1gbawr4,AgentAzael,2024-10-25 03:20:08,Seasonal caches not dropping exotics?,4,20,"My friend and I have been milking the Throwback Event's global events, spending all our stars on seasonal caches trying to obtain specific exotics, yet we have opened over 60 seasonal caches so far and neither of us have had a single exotic drop yet.

According to [Ubisoft's press release](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/28OmSUyy9oVttICJ45zxye/y6s2-throwback-event) (and an identical [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1fyj8wa/the_division_2_y6s2_throwback_event/) on Reddit), there should be a flat 10% chance for specific seasonal caches to drop a corresponding exotic. But we have been purchasing these caches with our event currency and not a single exotic has come out of those caches for either of us.

Yes, we are purchasing the correct caches. The ones named ""Year 2 Season 1 Cache"" and similar. The ones listed in the chart in those links above. I specifically am trying to obtain the Collector exotic chest and thus have been purchasing the ""Year 5 Season 2 Cache"" repeatedly. I have opened exactly 32 of them and not a single exotic has dropped. Only Lengmo and Ortiz Exuro gear has ever come out of that cache. My friend has spent about 15 stars on the same cache, and another 15 or so on another season cache; not a single exotic has dropped for him either.

Yeah, I know, *RNG*. But odds are odds. With a supposed 10% chance per cache, the odds of opening 60 caches and receiving zero exotics calculates out to 0.52% (1 in 192). The fact that we have zero is either a bug or ***extremely*** poor luck.

We're playing on PC, though that shouldn't matter.

I hope it becomes a game that stands side by side with the Destiny series as a top contender.

I wish Ubisoft would provide just a bit more support for the main game.

1g7i4ce,GnarlyAtol,2024-10-20 04:38:05,Division 2 game development: quick wins?,0,6,"Hi,

while I am sitting on a catamaran in the beautiful Belize, enjoying the second largest barrier reef and the beautiful islands, enjoying local rum from Belize and Guatemala and beer from Belize but waiting till the storm from Nicaragua is over … I am thinking what Ubi/Massive could do for me 😊 while waiting for the next Ghost Recon, D2 Brooklyn DLC and Division 3 😊.

Perhaps we are lucky and D2 gets further game development, year 7 …, till the release of Division 3.

In the game development since year 4 the focus was on modes (Countdown, Descent, Incursion), 2 more legendary levels for existing missions, new progression system Expertise, new gear, guns, exotics and apparel, rebalancing of gear and guns, reward rebalancing for open world activities, daily/weekly projects …, bug fixes, improvements of manhunts and restructuring of endgame and seasons.

Quite a lot I would say, esp. when taking into account that we were not asked to pay for it (apart for season passes, apparel).

If the game gets further development I am thinking about what could be relatively “easy“ topics for further improving the game, content that requires way less ressources than preparing new missions, new areas … or DLCs.

What are your ideas? 

Some I have in mind:
- replayability of the mask hunters and inclusion in weekly projects. Sure some are annoying to unlock but others are easy. It’s existing content that could be used
- replayability of side missions plus addition to weekly projects. Sure, most locations are used for bounties but not all of them, eg the Pentagon side mission, and a bounty is not a side mission. Again, existing content.
- replayability of the DC and NY prologue missions from the campaigns
- the final manhunt battles can now be replayed, would be good to include them in the projects
- use of the contaminated buildings for replay (limited activity but why not, it’s existing) and use in projects
- DZ optional PvE mode for the players who don’t want PvP

Less quick wins:
- use of mode maps for missions, bounties ….the maps from Raids, Countdown, Kenly, Summit, Descent and Incursion. NPCs/battles are already on these maps, some tweaks to transform them into additional main missions as second use case. They did that already with Countdown for the Anderson manhunt mission.
- smaller variant of main missions: bigger missions are less played; could be reduced for a second use case. This has been partially done for final manhunt battles already.
- new open world activity: search tasks that require searching in open world (eg searching for information in computers, missing persons, hidden virus research …). Such search tasks can be designed in more easy or more difficult settings, providing more concrete or more vague information for the search, requiring less or more steps. Using of existing locations only, eg mission areas, areas used for hiding SHD crates, underground areas, contaminated areas, … Such search activities can be designed without any battles (which would be easy) or with some recycled existing open world activities/bounties as done in a winter project.
-improving the immersion of the game. A big criticism I often read was lacking atmosphere. Perhaps some ressources could be invested for improving atmosphere, more signs of drama and violence, some burning fires, some desperate civilians here and there, reducing the teddies, …

All the ideas are not meant to implement and not all at ones but some perhaps in the years ahead till D3 😊.

What are your ideas for quick wins?

I'll boot up the game and select the various activities even random activity and never get invited to a group. I go to the social tab and make sure that I'm in an Open group so that anyone could join or invite me. I'll wait for over 30 minutes sometimes just waiting to play with a group. I've tried running around in open world, summit, and missions with backup status enabled and no one joins either. I'm able to join friends groups through the social menu and they could join me.

I'm wondering if I have some sort of social privacy settings but I haven't been able to locate that stuff anywhere. Also wondering if I was soft banned. Last year I was running around with some random people I found in the dark zone for a few months, But to my knowledge none of the guys I was playing with were hacking.

1g25wa6,ChristianIncel,2024-10-13 02:00:47,One of the worst gaming communities out there [DEAD GAME].,0,18,"And this is coming from a DCUO player, DCUO being a game with the biggest 'elitists' you could imagine.



I'm not sure if this is because the game is just left now with the try-hard ~~kids~~ zoomers, but oh boy today was it for me, first I will start saying that this was not because it happened **to me** because it happened more than once but it was **just** for me back then, **but now it was two other people**, so not just my time was wasted but two other people.

A countdown, 'challenging' not 'heroic' mind you, everything was going super fine, heading to the admin lab, no one went down, the rogues got melted, no way this one could fail, then I see a 'player kicked from group', I was midway to admin at this point, not a problem, I told myself maybe this guy did something wrong like going on another wing by himself, I keep following a high SHD player as one 'should' because you know high SHD high IQ and experience, just like real life, older people are a hundred times smarter than your avera 20yo, right?

Then at admin another 'player kicked from group', at this point I know something was off, from eight players two getting the boot out of nowhere? no wipes, no downs? it was clear the leader had some mental problems, and less than two minutes later I was the next in line.

  
Why would you bother starting a countdown, waiting for the players to join, then kick then afterwards? is this what zoomers call 'trolling' these days, wasting my, other's people and YOUR time? I understand shooting the red propanes to disorient other agents, I don't like when people do it, so I circle as far as away from the propanes as possible, but this is a light 'joke' nothing to the point ranting on Reddit, pisses people off but not something to get riled up.

  
Now the '**dead game**' part, I'm currently SHD 86 but here is some background, four years ago I used to play it 'hardcore', when the highest SHD players were I believe around 4000\~ or so (maybe less? don't remember) and I was around **480**\~

I did **ALL** content, every single raid on the highest difficulty, every single mission on legendary, had a FB set with some PfE, never had a 'kicked from group' problem back then, did countdown countless times, I believe this was in the Baker's Dozen era.

Back then it was **super easy** to find groups, there was barely any elitism, I could open matchmake and be ready to hold Z in **less** than 10 seconds, on **ANY DIFFICULTY.**

Now? it is a joke, in the morning you barely get people doing content, specially before 10 in the morning.

  
Also clocking **SIXTY HOURS OF GAMEPLAY** and **NOT A SINGLE** backup call, I want to believe it is a glitch but I don't believe it, back then I \*we\* would constantly get backup calls, I would answer then all the time, now there is basically zero, the only content people play is countdown and you still vunarable to the \*mlg zoomer crowd\* who you will never know if they will kick you or not.

I enjoy the game, I enjoy it a lot, but since time trimed the playerbase down it only left it with the absolute scum, it drained all the good people who wanted to enjoy the game and left it with pure elitism and meta 'efficient farming' cringe, just like DCUO, old content is dead while the only thing play is the 'farming' content.

  
To make it even worse **Tencent** will be buying Ubisoft, so we **not** getting a Div3 and if we do is going to be another Suicide Squad tailored to hardcore zoomers who will get tired of the game because they need to constantly try something new because their tiny brains need constant stimulus, just like swaping down on Social Pages instead of watching a video for more than 8 seconds.

1fyj8wa,JokerUnique,2024-10-08 05:30:57,The Division 2 - Y6S2 Throwback Event,116,104,"#Throwback Event

&nbsp;

Agents, it's time to gear up for an exciting new event that takes us back through the heart of The Division 2's legacy. The Throwback Event kicks off on October 8 and runs until October 28 allowing players at level 40 and above to grab some of the best exotics in the game before we transition into the Seasons 2.0!

&nbsp;

***
##PROJECT CHAIN

The **Throwback Event** is your chance to relive the intense action of past Manhunt Climax Missions, with 10 limited-time projects, each lasting just two days.

Every project will spotlight a different Legacy Climax Mission, putting you up against iconic characters like Jupiter, Hornet, Bardon Schaeffer, Faye Lau, Captain Lewis, General Anderson, Stovepipe, Mari Singh, The Recruiter, and Agent Kelso.

&nbsp;

Each mission comes with a 100% drop rate for the best Exotics from past Seasons, but you can only complete them once. Rewards will be unlocked in the following order:

&nbsp;

Project | Exotic
---|---
Project 1 | Coyote’s Exotic Mask
Project 2 | Vile Exotic Mask
Project 3 | Memento Exotic Backpack
Project 4 | Scorpio Exotic Shotgun
Project 5 | Catharsis Exotic Mask
Project 6 | Bloody Knuckles Exotic Gloves
Project 7 | NinjaBike Messenger Bag Exotic Backpack
Project 8 | St. Elmo’s Engine Exotic Assault Rifle
Project 9 | Iron Lung Exotic LMG
Project 10 | Mosquito Exotic Pistol

&nbsp;

### Roadmap

&nbsp;

##SPECIAL GLOBAL EVENT SCHEDULE

To keep things exciting, we're also hosting 5 back-to-back Global Events during the Throwback period, each lasting four days. During these events, the **Global Vendor loot pool** gets a boost, featuring **Seasonal Caches** from previous updates.

This gives you a perfect opportunity to farm Exotics tied to those Seasons by spending Stars you earn while playing the Global Event.

The best part? The enhanced caches offer a **10% drop chance for Exotics**, and each cache now contains 2 items with a bonus Exotic drop chance. This allows you to target the specific Exotic you're after with much better odds.

&nbsp;

Cache | Exotic
---|---
Year 2 Season 1 Cache | Coyote’s Exotic Mask
Year 2 Season 2 Cache | Mantis Exotic MMR / Vile Exotic Mask
Year 2 Season 3 Cache | Memento Exotic Backpack / Backfire Exotic SMG
Year 2 Season 4 Cache | Waveform Exotic Holster  / Scorpio Exotic Shotgun
Year 4 Season 1 Cache | Catharsis Exotic Mask  / Dread Edict Exotic MMR  / Bluescreen Exotic LMG
Year 4 Season 2 Cache | Busy Little Bee Exotic Pistol  / Bloody Knuckles Exotic Gloves  / Doctor Home Exotic Rifle
Year 4 Season 3 Cache | Sacrum Imperium Exotic MMR  / NinjaBike Messenger Bag Exotic Backpack
Year 5 Season 1 Cache | Shocker Punch Exotic Holster  / St. Elmo’s Engine Exotic AR
Year 5 Season 2 Cache | Iron Lung Exotic LMG  / Collector Exotic Chest
Year 5 Season 3 Cache | Mosquito Exotic Pistol  / Rugged Gauntlets Exotic Gloves

&nbsp;

To sum up, you're free to play any game mode or mission you want during the Throwback Event. No restrictions---just pure farming fun.

This event isn't just about the loot (though that's a huge part of it). It's also a celebration of everything that's brought us to this point in Division 2, as we prepare for the next big leap with Seasons 2.0. Whether you're catching up on the story, farming exotics, or getting ready for what's next, the Throwback Event is the perfect way to re-immerse yourself in the world of Division.

So, squad up, hit those projects, and get ready to take down some of the Division's most notorious enemies. Your rewards? The best gear Division 2 has to offer.

&nbsp;

See you in D.C., Agents.

All I have ever wanted from the developers of this game is additional maps (Cities) with NEW missions and more legendary content. How about Chicago as a DLC? Miami and Los Angeles have been done to death with other games. The addition of ""expertise"" I managed to tolerate until now with the major grind to upgrade my weapons and gear...however there has been a corresponding ""balancing"" of NPC characteristics which has made the expertise system pretty much pointless. The Devs continue to talk balancing. It's like employers talking ""flexibility""...all their way! So I now can virtually never find others online to run Tidal Basin or Manning Zoo Legendary missions. These are a challenge indeed and I have completed them several times with a good group. However the rewards are lousy. Should be able to get minimum 3 exotic components for successful completion. I could go on but gets boring. If Division 3 ever eventuates I may have a look to see how it works but IMO the people at Massive/Ubisoft are gradually destroying what has been a fantastic experience and for me an unparalleled game..

1fsd9ij,Raidenski,2024-09-30 03:59:50,The (Chiappa) Rhino was specifically designed to reduce recoil...so why does it still have such horribly low stability in this game? ,229,41,"The Rhino, developed and produced by Chiappa Firearms, was designed with a 6 o'clock, low-bore axis, where the barrel is located on the bottom of the frame as opposed to the more traditional 12 o'clock top-bore axis located at the top of the frame. 

This design, which was patented by Emilio Ghisoni, who also designed the Mateba Model 6 Única (aka Mateba Autorevolver), was made specifically to reduce recoil often experienced in traditional revolvers; firing a bullet from the Chiappa Rhino, the kickback would push the firearm backwards, as opposed to upwards. 

Realistically speaking, the Rhino was designed specifically to have less recoil than your average revolver/pistol, and should havet he highest stability out of all the sidearms available in the game, so why is it that firing this gun in the game has such really bad recoil? 

As a relatively new player, when I first saw this weapon in the Weapons Vendor, I was excited to unlock it at a later point, and when I finally found a copy and fired away, I was beyond disappointed at just how horrible the recoil is; at the very least it should have the same level of recoil as the M1911, if not miles better. 

Did Ubisoft just add it into the game without doing any research on it whatsoever just because it looks cool? 

I know this is just a videogame, but as someone who's been interested in firearms for most of their life, I would have expected a multi-billion dollar videogame developer to have done at least some research into a weapon's designs and how the effect of changing traditional designs would impact the functionality of a weapon, especially as something as fundamentally different as a 6 o'clock barrel.

Most of the time I get invites I end up ignoring them because accepting automatically brings up the PS+ purchase menu, and I can't afford it, which also means I don't have access to the Dark Zone. 

So today, I found myself walking through the DZ checkpoint, I restock my ammo, and for some inexplicable reason I found myself attempting to access the Dark Zone, and to my complete shock I walked right through and entered. I still don't know how, and my only guess is that either Ubisoft or Sony gave us poors free access to online play, which has occurred in the past. 

Anyways, so here I am, excited to explore *The Dark Zone*, this mythical area of New York City that was cordoned off after The First Wave was unable to properly contain the outbreak, the lawless land where all factions wage war amongst themselves. Holy shit. 

The enemies were tough, elite, it was not your run of the mill enemy combatants, it would take more caution than ever before to survive. My eyes glance at the bottom left corner, ""X killed Y""...oh shit, this is not just a PvE, but a PvP, as well. I calm myself, I don't see any other players nearby, all the years of playing Metal Gear Solid will have to come into play if I am to survive. 

I encounter some enemies, several, many...and I start levelling up like crazy. Three dead, and I'm already at level 3, this should be fun. 

I manage to snipe the last enemy combatant, and they drop a nice turquoise Vest, so I pick it up. Now I'm at an extraction point; I struggle a bit to call in for an extraction, and finally I shoot out a flair straight into the sky. ETA, approximately two minutes. Okay, I'll just hide behind a barricade until the timer expires. 

I see an enemy, carrying a heavy backpack, an elite techie, he hasn't seen me, okay, I can keep hiding, more enemies show up, but my cover isn't blown...yet. 

Then, from seemingly out of nowhere, a charger comes up from behind me and swings at me with a baseball bat; ""WHAT THE FUCK?!"" Chaos begins, and I find myself on the defensive. I take out the wannabe MLB player, but more and more enemies show up. 

I takeout the other, and another, I should be able to survive. The extraction helicopter arrives; fuck it, I'm outta here. I strap myself in, but now I'm in the red, and Boom! I get taken out...by another player??? 

I lose the vest. Time for round 2. I go back. I find several caches, I'm fucking loaded, I go up a multistory parking lot, an extraction point, I go up to the top. I eliminate the enemy Rikers patrolling the area...it should be safe now. I shoot the flair, and hide behind cover. 

Elite soldiers rush to my location. I launch a grenade, eliminate two Rikers, launch a seeker mine...and I am getting my shit *wrecked*. Evasive maneuvers! Do a barrel roll! I duck behind another cover. 

Then, like a bad case of Deja Vu, an enemy soldier opens fire on my blind spot. It's another player. COWARD! I'm down. They walk up, and melee me. Not even worth the final bullet. They kill the remaining Rikers, walk up to my corpse, and wave. 

Damn mfer didn't even think twice about helping a new player...and suddenly, I'm reminded exactly why I hate PvP games.

Long and short is I own the base game on Ubisoft Connect or Uplay or whatever it's called. The ultimate edition of the game is currently on sale on steam for like £12, and I've been eyeing it up to get back into the game as I've missed having a looter game to play.

I'm going on the assumption it actually runs via Ubisoft Launcher from an old post somewhat relating to this but the steam version has achievements so now I'm not even sure if it does or not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1fl7jda/buying_on_steam_when_game_is_owned_on_ubisoft/,thedivision

Canadians and Germans are not presented in the good context. Let's imagine that everything was correct:

FC1 - the main character is a German agent George Krieger, and the main villain is an American doctor Carver.

FC2 - Warren Clyde will be Canadian, but the Jackal will most likely remain a Yankee.

FC3 - Jason and his friends will come from Canada/France, Hurk and Willis most likely too, but is there a powerful analogue of the CIA in Canada and France?

FC: Blood Dragon - instead of Canada, the USA will become a radioactive wasteland. Rex Colt and Colonel Sloane will be Canadian soldiers, and Dr. Darling will be an American on the run.

FC4 - Ishwari and Ajay will escape to Canada/France, Hurk and Willis see above.

FC5 and FCND - the action now takes place in Canada, and Hurk Sr. will hate the Yankees, Roger Cadore will become an American with an accent that is God knows what.

So, I was thinking if Ubisoft ever made a new Farcry game asides from 7, to be where it's set in s country where guns sre illegal with tbe exception of using a license to possess them.

The concept is that you have to obey the laws like real life unlike past Farcrys that just use the 'choatic leadership' method.

Ik a lot of people wouldn't like this idea, but it'd be more fun to have to conceal weapons illegally, similarly to FC2 where in peace zones you have to holster your gun.

Also if there was a police notiriety system it'd make said game realistic and fun imo.

From what I searched it does say all dlcs are available in the season pass but in the description it says gold edition includes the “Limited edition &amp” is this some extra stuff which only the gold edition has? Or is this available in the standard edition too if I buy the season pass?

Also the season pass costs €9 in Ubisoft launcher on sale meanwhile the whole gold edition costs €9 in epic games store on sale (as epic games gives us the Ubisoft launcher copy it’s basically like buying it in the Ubisoft launcher).

I also play Ghost recon Wildlands which I think has way less fans and is also from Ubisoft, but it has so much more content and such a big and good map.

After finishing the fifth installation recently I jumped straight into 6. Gotta say I love both games BUT they also kinda suck. For me, main purpose of Far Cry is the gunplay, not for Ubisoft though. After 4 it went down hill. I feel like it's not their priority now. Which is a shame because that's what is the most fun for me in these games. It honestly seems (in 6 especially) they turned the game into some weird Assassins Creed style game. Mainly with the camp and the grind, loot boxes and treasures. I personally don't mind it so much. With that said, both games are beautiful, (especially 6) and have interesting huge worlds. Even though 6 has better world building and much more life, 5 still holds up. All in all I do recommend both games. If you can get only one then go for 6 definitely. BUT BUT BUT I hate to say this, for me it's fun ONLY with mods. Without them the experience is much much worse. If u get the game you NEED Resistance mod (FC5) and Libertad mod (FC6). They are big mod packs in which you can choose loads of quality of life imrprovements that make the game so much more enjoyable. I recommend especially using weapon rebalance mods. So if you are a fan of FC and want to enjoy the last 2 games at least as much as 3 or 4 use the mods. Go for it and you'll have many hours of fun.

1fr63ph,deleted,2024-09-28 12:08:41,Do you guys really can't see how lacking the graphics in e.g. Far Cry 6 are?,0,0,"And is it because you're playing on TV, far away, so a lot of it gets lost anyway?

  
To be clear, I'm not talking about art design. All the games have beautiful worlds.  
I'm not talking about detail either, I'm fine with games not having detail (FC has it).  
I'm also not comparing Far Cry to some ""better"" series to put it down, I've played all the games I could, often several times. I'll buy FC7 if it comes out for sure.

I'm guessing Ubisoft has issues with their graphics engine in general, as AC Valhalla was the ugliest game I remember playing.

For example, I'm replaying FC5 right now, which to me looked a bit better than 6 for some reason, and even on highest possible settings I can't make it look good. Not great, good. I would say it looks ""passable, I guess"", but nowhere near the level that would enhance my enjoyment of traversing such a pretty in game environment.

The games have what I call a watercolor painting look to them. Often what is right in front of you is clear, the rest fades out really fast. When there's a lot of details (e.g. leaves, etc.) it becomes really hard to distinguish it. In fact, characters and items often blend into the environment because of the watercolor effect, nothing stands out clearly like in other games. Everything is grainy and blurry at the same time. Like there are a lot of small sharp edges and irregular lines and then they've all been blurred out out to hide that, but it's still showing beneath the blur.

So FC5 without AA (1440p, everything on ultra) looks like someone took a lower resolution game and then just stretched it accross the screen. The detail is not close to 1440p level (lots of ""pixelated"" grainy parts) and then the blur of the mismatched resolution kicks in. Not saying that's what it is, but that's how it looks like.

TAA makes everything really really blurry. It's like it does not address the parts it should but just removes the sharpness on everything. And SMAA is better in that regard but not strong enough to address the grainy parts in a satisfying way.

What works better than both of these is putting the scaling, or whatever they called it, to 200 instead of the default 100. That actually makes it look closer to a game that is natively in 1440p, although only halfway to that point. 

And then of course, the mentioned problem still remains but to a lesser extent.

No AA = a lot of detail, but rough and grainy.  
TAA = introducing all the blur you've just partially removed.  
SMAA = removing some of the sharpness but introducing some of the blur.

So I usually play with SMAA until I get tired of nothing looking sharp, then switch to no AA 200 scaling until I get tired of all the pixels, etc.

I mean, there are games out there that have engines where everything is crisp, detailed and does not blend into the environment, but Ubisoft games are not among them.

Btw I'm not a graphics snob. I play and love a lot of old games and graphics are not near the top of the list of what I want in a game. There are even text games I like playing. But I'll make an exception and break the silence if the graphics are such that I feel like my eyes have seen better days and I need glasses right now, only to realize that no, everything is still sharp and nice as soon as I alt+tab.

A DLC should be easy, enjoyable and an extra reward for hardcore players. Not this crap.

1fp76xt,Raidenski,2024-09-25 23:26:05,What was it about Far Cry 3 that sets it apart from other FPS videogames? ,261,103,"I had never been a huge fan of FPS games, often favoring games that have a Third-Person camera perspective, but every so often there are outliers that get my attention. 

The release of Call of Duty: Black Ops back in 2010 saw the return of widespread acclaim from hardcore gamers to casuals alike, it was a historical moment, worthy of its own entry to G4 Tech TV's Icons show. Destiny and Destiny 2 also come to mind as outliers, mostly for aesthetic reasons, including sound design. 

However, nothing quite came close to Far Cry 3. From the story, to the likable characters such as Dennis Rogers, to the obvious Vaas Montenegro, and even Jason Brody who felt like the perfect self-insert for young men in their 20's. The weapon customization also felt unique, in a way, with unlockable weapons and attachments that you could mix and match with. 

The story was also very different from your average FPS, you're not some seasoned soldier with years of military training and a 5 o'clock shadow, you're a college-aged adrenaline junkie who likes to party with his friends who accidentally skydived onto the wrong island and now you're neck deep in a civil war amongst the locals. By the halfway point, this sheltered fratboy with zero experience handling firearms ends up becoming one of the most fierce warriors to rival Vaas himself, earning the nickname ""Snow White"". 

From iconic moments such as burning an entire crop of cannabis plants with a flamethrower, hearing, and even feeling, the excitement of Jason as he undoubtedly inhaled those fumes, to fighting Vaas in what can only be described as a reality twisting dream sequence, to torturing your little brother, and even a one-on-one knife fight between you and some crazy Australian. To say nothing of fighting a literal dragon-snake with a bow, and a beautifully decorated, Chinese knife. 

This game places you in situations no other FPS game has taken you. Despite all this, I still can't say for certain what it was about Far Cry 3 that sets it apart from other FPS videogames; that not even Far Cry 4 had me as immersed from the start (and finish) as Far Cry 3. 

Ubisoft even ended up bringing back the motion capture/voice actor for Vaas Montenegro, Michael Mando, in a DLC for Far Cry 6. 

I'd love to hear your opinions on what made this game stand out even after several sequels. ",https://i.redd.it/qd6nrrt64zqd1.jpeg,farcry

1fo86tr,Jesse_Melon,2024-09-24 17:13:27,Ubisoft Has Gone So Far for The FC Series…Is It A Good Time To Look Back And Have A Fresh Start?,6,19,"Before I go ahead, I just want to say I DID enjoy the FC23456 and even Primal. These are amazing games and they did a good job for exploring new ways for FC and even other games.

However, from my perspective, I have kinda feeling that Ubisoft has gone too far on the current direction and changed the base design of the game to be more “magical (unrealistic)”, “light”, and “fast-paced” since FC New Dawn. In a way, this change brought a fresh beginning for players just like AC Origins did back then. But the good feeling did not last long especially when Ubisoft applied the same set of design to ALL other games. It gives people a strong feeling that every piece of UBI game is tasted like the same thing — some RPG mixing with some rebel staff then maybe add some more outposts, gunplays or stealth and here you go.

Not to mention the recent failure of SW and the upcoming AC, we all know that what will happen if we keep this momentum going to the next FC. So I think it is a good time for UBI to reconsider their strategy for the FC series. In my opinion, it should be a good idea to consider remaking an old FC game and try if bringing back old stuff (with reasonable and  attractive new features) can help UBI to have a breakthrough like the Resident Evil Re2.

1fo3o07,deleted,2024-09-24 11:52:40,Does anyone else find new FC games ugly?,0,0,"I don't mean the art design, I mean the graphic engine itself as I've noticed the same (or worse) in other Ubisoft games as well.

For example FC6 on my PC, 1440p, I want to say it looks like a 10 year old game... but then I remember Mad Max came out in 2015 and that game looks better in most things that matter.

What these games look like to me is like the native resolution is much lower than native, so it's very pixelated. And then SMAA doesn't help nearly as much as it should and TAA makes everything smeared.

IRL I don't see great without glasses and I can't make out details in the distance, but FC5/6 look magnitudes more smeary compared to other games than the world looks to me without glasses.

Luckily, I have a good enough GPU to crank the scaling to 2.0 which still has the same issues (smeared TAA and not enough help with SMAA), but it's better. It's still not looking good, mind you, it's just on a ""screw it, I'll play it, I guess"" level.

Honestly, I would've enjoyed these games way more for their nature and locations, like I did with Days Gone, for example, if the engine didn't let them down hard. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1fo3o07/does_anyone_else_find_new_fc_games_ugly/,farcry

1gg5dtv,IDKthrowaway838,2024-10-31 11:28:17,This game is very flawed…,13,2,"But I love it so much. I started playing a few days ago and it’s so great. I live in Montana and it’s insane how accurate they got to the area, and I feel like I’ve actually been to the small town bars and shops. The gameplay is so fun and I love how much random stuff happens in the world. The gunplay is great and the stealth is even better. The knife takedowns of past games were great but I love how clean and brutal the neck snaps and punches are. This game is also very funny, and I love how unabashedly American it is. The characters are also cool as hell, especially the pastor. I’m not far in but the villains are great, and it was really smart to have 4 instead of just 1.

My flaws are that the game is very buggy sometimes, but my one of my favorite games is cyberpunk (played at launch) so I can deal with it. It does suck though to reload checkpoints a bunch because stuff doesn’t trigger, characters get distracted by non-existent enemies, etc. I also do wish that the character talked at least a little bit, but I can overlook it. I think my main flaw is how doing side missions progress story missions (which is a common complaint). I love to just spend a session and do random side content and relax and put on a podcast or something in open world games like these, but I can’t really do it with this game. If I trigger the progress bar I kinda just have to wait to be kidnapped and can’t do what I want. It also means that the plot can ramp up consistently and can’t be as connected. If I could change one thing it would absolutely be that.

Despite my complaints I love it and could say even more. I wish these devs could get hired by an actually good publisher, because this game is so amazing and it’s a shame how annoying ubi is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FarCry5/comments/1gg5dtv/this_game_is_very_flawed/,farcry5

1e5v7br,Novel-Struggle6820,2024-07-18 06:21:37,Far Cry 6 appreciation post,37,28,"I'm Fully expecting to get troll hate for this. bring it on. I fell in love with this game when i started playing it 2 years ago. The crimson red and evergreen colortone that the programers use to underscore the game, the performances of the actors, the gameplay mechanics. I never listen to much reagaton before this game, and now I listen to the soundtrack to FC6 on repeat. Ive gotten platinum with some online friends of mine, and they always mention that Far Cry 5 is their favorite game, in part, because of the Natural Beauty of the Montana valley that serves as its setting. Im American, and Ive never been enamored with the artistic direction of a Far Cry game, until Far Cry 6. Driving around the tropical paradise of cuba in a 50's car is immersive in a way I have never felt before playing a ubisoft game. The characters story, and setting are an oasis I can retreat too when the real world gets tough.

This has not been the critical reception of the game. Players have lamented that this is BY FAR the worst Far Cry game to date. Ubisoft stopped updating the game what? A year and a half ago? And a lot of the information shared about the development of Far Cry 7 has been in reference too to how they will fix the problems of FC6. Ubiosoft made FC6 a playstaion plus game on the month when? A year after it's release?  It feels like they panicked in attempt to tourniquet the hemorrhage of artistic and financial failure hat was far cry 6. 

I'm not choosing to die on the hill for Far Cry 6, nor am I trying to change anyone's opinion of it. I am perplexed not because my opinion of FC6 diverges from the group consensus, but because it seems to be the total antithesis of it. My question is, has anyone else experienced this? Especially in the last 5 years? Where you had something that you liked, or loved, and all of the critical and user reception was garbage? I have found personal examples of it more and more in the last couple of years, and I'm wondering if any of you have examples where you felt like your were looking at the emperor's clothes because your opinion differed so severely from the group consensus?",https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry6/comments/1e5v7br/far_cry_6_appreciation_post/,farcry6

It’s just an AK47 with a different skin. (A different barrel lol)

The only upgrade is that tiny touch accuracy buff.. (it’s should be hitting harder, much faster, and more accurately..)

In my opinion don’t buy this, if you have the Libertad custom AK47. Even the sound is the same when firing it.. spend your hard earned moneda on other things.

This was actually my favorite Supremo, but it’s so stupid how Ubisoft implemented it. Nine times out of ten, it doesn’t even hit what you want to hit, that is if you can even get it to hit something in the first place. Not to mention the fact that you can’t even aim it. I mean, god, there were five whole helicopters in front of me and what did the missiles choose to hit? A random car so far away I couldn’t even see it, and it missed. If you’re going to chase down a random car that I’m not even looking in the general direction of, at least hit it. For the love of god, you would not believe the number of times I had so many people shooting at me, cars, tanks, helicopters, soldiers you name it, and I use it for the missiles to just straight up not hit anything.

The ending of FC6 was anti-climatic but also very poetic and realistic. Anton Castillo has a huge god complex. Dani and Libertad tore his power away from him. Castillo knew he was beat, and knew the huge risk of the population outcasting Diego. For him, the only way to save his son was to give him a quick death and not be tortured or some shit. He killed himself because he was not going to give the power of his life to Dani after Dani already stole the power of his country. So, he does it himself. 

I swear Juan was a spy (Or a “Bode” for any Jedi Survivor players)  I read a note about a Juan Cruz enlisting in the special forces and Juan’s sus call with McKay and him literally getting Clara killed. 

The ending with Juan selling the viviro kind of makes sense?? He just wants money, hence him wanting Dani to save McKay for the money.

What do you guys think about the ending? Overall I wish it showed an epilogue cutscene of Yara like a year after or something.

1bvw861,eldoristd,2024-04-05 03:25:25,"I do not understand the hate, at all",34,44,"I never played any far cry games, so I decided to try far cry 5 before 6 since they're both on gamepass, I played 5 and wasn't too into it, I liked some aspects of it but for me, the whole cult story was outdated and repetitive, it was an okay game. Regardless, I decided to try far cry 6 and I did not expect to love it as much.

I'm from a country that had a revolution 50 years ago, it's very close to my heart, this game makes me feel thrilled to be playing it, the story embedded everything I believe in, the character devirsity made me feel welcome, I had never seen a trans guy as a character before, and as one myself, I shed a tear when I met Paolo. 

Besides the personal factor, the radiolist is amazing, the scenery is breathtaking, the mechanics, while very similar to far cry 5, were a huge huge improvement, I hated the guns and how easy they were to get in far cry 5, none of them made me particularly happy either, the guns in this game are a major improvement, as well as the trade system. 

The buddies are also an improvement, I didn't care for the characters in far cry 5, didn't even use them, the amigos in this game was a complete win for ubisoft, my partner who doesn't care for video-games in general even became a bit obsessed with chicharon. I always have an amigo even if I'm not using him. 

The main complaint I see everywhere is that the story is boring and they're going back to far cry 5 to replay it, I simply don't get it, to me the cult cliche was the boring thing, I've seen it too many times in Hollywood TV shows, movies, etc, and they're always glorified and inaccurate, the accuracy and realism of FC6 is what makes me so happy to be playing it.

There are many cool things about this game, Lara's operations are also worth a mention, I can definitely understand some criticism such as the treasure hunts are usually not worth the price, in FC5 they were the only thing I actually looked forward to, but those are small details imo. 

Long story short, I don't understand how FC6 is the one considered with the boring story, and FC5 the best one, when FC5's plot is so predictable and on every streaming platform, as well as highly inaccurate, and FC6's plot is based so much on our world history. 

Play what you like of course, not here trying to bring down a game for the pure fun of it, I simply don't understand where it comes from.

2. Why the fuck can’t you kill bembe? Yeah yeah he had power and is fighting for the revolution, but he is profiteering, he doesn’t care who wins, so he’s actually not fighting the revolution.

3.Anton’s pathetic, I feel like I’m fighting a battle already won the whole game. He was basically on the decline since the beginning. 
He is childish, acts impulsively, doesn’t adapt at all to your plans, he just sits there amongst the flames burning his “paradise”

And Diego has an interesting premise, he starts of confused, and in the end he’s… still confused?. C’mon ubi, his story arc basically should’ve written itself, but instead he did nothing the entire story.

I guess you can’t make the momentum of the revolution as impactful when you segment the story into 3 region where the player can do any of them first.

4.Juan killed Clara, in the confrontation, juan had a clear shot of anton’s hand and gun, the one of two weapon in the room, after that I could have easily imagined Dani taking the gun from him.

trailer link: [https://youtu.be/FcMRkyoHKeA?si=1sWaGW8muzPbXS22](https://youtu.be/FcMRkyoHKeA?si=1sWaGW8muzPbXS22)

When I watched the trailer, I couldn't believe what I was seeing in reality, and I was impatiently waiting for the game, and of course, in the end we all know what happened.

Sometimes I would say to myself everything that was shown at E3  
it was just a lie, or just a fake video that was recorded and shown only, and that game does not exist in the first place, but I am wrong. 

You can find another video on the Ubisoft channel

link: [https://youtu.be/7JcujYbctPk?si=DcpSh4NkOz9H2IlM](https://youtu.be/7JcujYbctPk?si=DcpSh4NkOz9H2IlM)

which shows one of the development team trying out the game in front of the audience, and it was very clear that the gameplay was different compared to the other video above.

This means that that copy of the game already exists and is hidden somewhere and no one knows where it is. I'm really sad that we can't get that version, even if we did get that short demo, we might have been able to take advantage of it and integrate it with the original game.

There are some people who tried to work on the game to make it resemble a trailer, but unfortunately, even despite all these efforts, it is very difficult to approach it.

It's been almost 12 years since this happened, and I still go and watch that trailer, which really blows my mind every time, even though it's 2024, but it was really ahead of its time. I'm not saying that the game in the latest version was bad, on the contrary I actually liked it, but if the experience had been as it appeared in the trailer, it would have been the same. It will be completely different.

Unfortunately, we can do nothing but hope that Ubisoft will remake this game for this generation.

1frjy4f,JocularWand9568,2024-09-29 01:51:12,"Watch Dogs: Overruled, The Idea ",22,9,"I recently came across a post on fandom for a [fourth Watch Dogs](https://ideas.fandom.com/wiki/Watch_Dogs:_Overruled) that I fully support after reading the article.

The idea suggests a setting in New Orleans in 2005. While I disagree with the suggestion to make it more like WD2, fun and light, I also don't think it should be as somber as WD1.

Set in 2005 should reference more heavily to Ray's blackout in '03 in the form of the occasional news broadcast, maybe a wanted poster, or something from Blume looking for Ray. However, I can't decide if Ray should make a full appearance in the game because being on the run from Blume likely wouldn't lead to him surfacing so soon.

This section is straight from the post on fandom:

""The story takes place in New Orleans in 2005, where an early prototype of CtOS was being developed and tested by private companies and the government agencies. The story, as previously mentioned, is short, spanning over the course of only 15 or so main story missions. The player follows Max Parker, a software engineer who was wrongly accused of a crime by a glitch in the prototype CTOS, and served 3 years in prison. After his sentence ended, he vowed to expose CTOS for its mistakes and what the ramifications of having such technology could be with the help of an old friend from High School, Jack Henderson (think of him kinda like Ned from Spider-Man: Homecoming). Also, there will be heavy themes of racism featured in the story.""

Personally, I think the wrongfully accused bit rings too close to Marcus, but if it was done slightly differently it could make a great story. Despite the chance that it might not land well, I agree with the theme of racism idea, it would be an immersive detail and could be used to add a flair of difficulty to the game that Ubisoft has been lacking in recent years.

The post suggests a short gameplay, spanning about 15 main story missions, which I also disagree with, I think it should be a longer, full-fledged, story of at least 20 main missions.

Overall I really like the idea of another game in the series but I think Ubi needs to get their shit together before coming back to Watch Dogs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/1frjy4f/watch_dogs_overruled_the_idea/,watch_dogs

 Yes, the game was downgraded.

 But did those graphics really exist in the first place? If it is just editing, CGI? Or if these graphics were made for a short, highly scripted demo that was much smaller than a large open-world game?

 And if they really existed, why to date no Ubisoft game has reached this graphic level? Since the explanation that the developers gave at the time was that they ""didn't really know the PS4 and Xbox One"". But now they know, right?

 And if the game had been released with those graphics, would it have been better? Since it's not just graphics that a game lives on. The content would still remain the same.

Why all these promises? Why all this effort, money and time spent just to sell a lie?

 And most importantly: What did Ubisoft expect to happen? When the game was released everyone would see that it was all a lie. And even though they made a lot of money from pre-sales, the company's reputation would be tarnished forever. And that's what happened.

 These doubts remain in my head for years. Could it be that today, after 10 years, no convincing explanation exists?

* a lot of people complained about the repetitiveness of the game, I don't see this game as a top quality production to be honest, if I play it knowing this, how good are the levels?
* How boring is it to play with random characters knowing that it's one of the last mid-level games ubi made?

1fgvfh5,Unable-Literature671,2024-09-15 04:39:19,"We're screwed anyway, let's talk about our WD4 delusions.",30,42,"Just like I said. ""Star Wars: Outlaws"" seemed to have a decent performance, but it fell short of the revival of Ubisoft.

This means that Ubisoft will move toward saving money by excluding future planned follow-ups.

In the meantime, I decided to write because I wanted to unravel my thoughts on WD4.

I thought about so many things, but it's a shame that I can't forget it like this.

First, let's talk about the starting point for the character.

The main character is either a college student who is good at hacking or just graduated from college. He has excellent hacking skills and inexperienced engineer skills.

And he have a very lively, close friend or family I've known for a long time, who resembles Wrench's personality.

Here, I'll call the above person ""N"" from now on.

N wasn't good at hacking and was always inexperienced, but he got along well with the main character because of his excellent engineer skills.

That's how the main character was supposed to meet N in the evening,

Just before meet, N across the street from the traffic light dies in an accident.

There are various causes such as bombing accidents, vehicle autonomous driving errors, and terrorism.

""But"" N's accident is a murder disguised as an accident. He doesn't know it yet.

The main character finds N's smartphone while organizing N's belongings.

And I hack to unlock my smartphone with N's lock on it.

After unlocking N's smartphone, the main character sees a picture of N's smartphone memories of each other, but N's smartphone messenger gets a notification.

""Yo. Why didn't you log in? I've been waiting for you so long :(""

So the protagonist meets with a team member from one of the few remaining Dedsec branches that survived the enormous ""Blume"" crackdown and online detection after Watchdogs 2.

also thought about this intermediate process, but I didn't write it down because I thought the story would be too long.

Now, shall we introduce the ""Refresh"" Dedsec character that has barely survived?

First, character K with a similar position to our Wrench and Jordi. 😎

K is a good match for N, and he's the one who helped N join Dedsec.

K's specialty is a character who can act like the main character.

So, he's a character who can investigate while working separately with the main character in the future.

K is a very easy person to get things related to guns and car computer parts. Isn't it amazing?

Now, let me introduce the character O.

O is a very cautious friend. O's specialties are 2D, 3D art, and hacking

I think O's appearance will remind me of Overwatch's mei.

Or the García of Criminal Minds comes to mind.

and She have long black hair. She like black Cloth very much, but not Goth.

But she wears a mask or mask every day and always uses a voice modulator when talking to strangers.

She hides himself from other Dedsec members besides the Dedsec members he met himself in person.

Oh, don't get me wrong. O doesn't have a scar. It's just that she hates lifting herself up.

She's a timid personality, but she does this for a reason. We'll learn from her assistant duties in the future.

However, O's hacking skills are excellent, so can't ignore them.

An essential figure in the online war using data research and AI Bot.

Let me introduce you to Y.

Y is similar to the role of a leader. It's a secret, but he always waiting in Dedsec.

Y is careful and cautious in speaking, but the moment the protagonist falls into a crisis, he makes a quick judgment and response to get him out of the crisis.

Lastly, it's a character named X.

X is kind of like a police officer and a soldier.

I'm in a bit of a hurry and I'm trying to act, but I think it's related to the crime syndicate or Blume that's coming up.

X later betrays Dedsec in the middle of the game, or misunderstands Dedsec. There must be a reason, right?

I want to talk more, but since it's a space for everyone, I just wrote down what came to mind.

And it's more fun than I thought it will be , but first I will like to acknowledge that yes most of the critisism this game got is warranted it's missing features from the first two games , is filled with bugs and I can get having no main character is a major turn-off from the game to some

That being said , I still found the game pretty fun , the recruitment system is a fun experiment while yes, some of the recruitment missions can be predictable and the dialogue is pretty iffy I still found it fun going around looking for operators that could help me in missions or just for giggles 

Futuristic London is a very well designed map and feels unique considering the amount of US-based maps we get in open world games I do like it over Chicago but it can't beat san Francisco due to the lack of interiors and abilities from WD2

So overall,  it's a fun 7/10 game it's the worst game in the trilogy but I don't think it's the game that doomed the franchise others claimed it to be , it's just a shame a creative concept got limited due to ubisoft and it's clichès ",https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/1fbaqs4/watch_dogs_legion_is_surprisingly_very_fun/,watch_dogs

The Party-Bot Sequence music is hard to hear because of the remarks of being a robot in the streets and an android in the sheets, and the Love-Bot Sequence music is hard to hear because of the resulting screaming and gunfire!  On top of all that, they're not the full song and have a speaker filter put over them for immersion.

I found out that Ubisoft uses a music library called ExtremeMusic, most or all of its music not being searchable by services such as AHA-Music, which makes them incredibly hard to find otherwise.  Downloads are only available for companies with accounts, and it doesn't seem like the average person can create an account.  However, the site is very unrestrictive and lets you listen to any of their songs with no limits at all.

I really enjoy WD1, I replay it regularly for fun. Aiden has his flaws, but I like the guy. The world is full of fun puzzles and the police chases are amusing too. Because I can see the cops eventually becoming so lazy or underfunded, they have to resort to scanning a city to find a criminal, (especially in the UK). With it being about as effective as it is in-game. 

WD2 I love for a different reason. It is 1’s laid-back younger brother. Instead of trying to eliminate a big bad tyrannical gangster, you’re toppling a big bad white collar hipster douchebag criminal. And you can have more fun doing it by sending the cops after the bad guys. 

Both games have their flaws, if I was leading this series I’d probably go back to the vigilante theme but make it more fun and have a more charismatic crew that work with it. Basically merge the two together but with added karma-balanced features like where you have the option to save people from random events or go the other way and become a SOB. 

Basically, what I am saying is the game series did not let us down. That was Ubisoft’s lack of vision. But neither WD1 or 2 deserves the hate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/1f1nmf7/i_dont_know_if_this_is_an_unpopular_opinion_or/,watch_dogs
1ezr7tt,Lord_Antheron,2024-08-24 07:33:30,Don’t assume that we’ll be getting more games even if the movie succeeds. ,27,13,"I apologise in advance for being that person, but I’ve seen a lot of people here lately posting under the assumption that the upcoming film will somehow “resurrect” or “save” the franchise if it goes well. 

Not only is that a REALLY big “if” coming from Ubisoft — who fumbled a film set in their biggest cash cow franchise — but even if the movie turns out to be the biggest hit of the year, that doesn’t mean they’re going to start hammering out games again. 

Let’s not forget that Watch Dogs got off to a rocky start in 2012-2014, and the sheer amount of stuff that was changed or scrapped during development could probably fill several textbooks. 

Then they did a huge 180 in an attempt to mitigate that initial PR nightmare in Watch Dogs 2, which polarised the fanbase and kind of left us wondering “well now what?” 

THEN they tried to win back the old audience whilst appealing to a broader demographic with the “Play As Anyone” system which they fucked up so hard *on purpose* between 2019 and 2020 out of misplaced fear, that they abandoned the game after about a year and left it a flaming hot mess. 

My point is, just because this franchise *deserves* more, and just because we happen to like the games, doesn’t mean a film is definitive proof Ubisoft hasn’t given up on games or that its success means they’ll make another one. The history there is very wobbly. Unstable. We probably won’t get more games. 

Emphasis on ***GAMES.*** There’s the rub. The catch. The bamboozle. For about ten years now they’ve tried and failed to make this their next huge IP with games. It never really worked out. Not compared to something like Assassin’s Creed or Far Cry. 

If anything, we should expect the movie’s success to mean… more movies. Or perhaps a streaming series. Because by now, they’ll probably realise that making another game is too risky for this IP. But making different content… that’s a more realistic thing to hope for. 

Just… temper your expectations, is all. I know that we all *want* there to be more games. But that doesn’t seem like the direction they’re going. This isn’t the first time they’ve shelved an IP, relegating it to a different form of media going forward, or reducing it to crossover content for microtransactions in other games.

The open world design of this game has a fundamental difference from most Ubisoft games ( been a long time since i played WD1 so can't remember if that one did this as well) and it is that the overall goal of the character is to get more followers to support his crew and not necessarily take control back of a city that is being entirelly controlled by bad guys So by doing this, they avoid their traditional super reptitive ""outpost capture"" gameplay loop and other ""checklist"" type activities.

San Francisco mostly just feels like it exists despite the player and be actually San Francisco at any given day, and not one controlled by an evil army. The world activities just feel more organic and not something that is there just to give me something to do and it all feels so much more enjoyable because of this.

Now, for some reason they went back to the ""take the city back"" style of design for WD:Legion and to me that's going backwards",https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/1enky6g/finally_started_playing_watch_dogs_2_and_im/,watch_dogs

I think maybe it's because out of all the operations in Legion this is the only one that felt *personal*. Not personal to any of the operatives but personal to the villain. Seeing Skye willingly do that to her own mother while having absolutely zero remorse was quite horrifying to say the least. Not to mention her deformed mother of an AI begging for her sweet release... Man.

Also that section where you go down the elevator into the basement... Only to find a whole ass house and yard blew me away and creeped me the fuck out simultaneously.

Bagley being related to Skye Larsen made soooooooo much sense in hindsight too, I really liked that reveal during the epilogue.

Idk something about the way this quest is written feels very Cyberpunk. It's not revolutionary or original, but it's a far cry (pun intended) from the majority of Ubisoft writing that feels very textbook nowadays.
Something I felt I haven't experienced since Far Cry 4.

Please. We need more of both of them. Only bad bits of the DLC were the two side operations, Fox Hunt and Council of Daves, and the grindyness of the street sweep. Only made it up to 5 on each gang.

Aiden is obviously a legend or a bogeyman for DedSec, based on their reactions to him.

1e755hv,deleted,2024-07-19 22:31:05,About the Recruit Anyone Mechanic in Legion,1,1,"I think in all honesty Watch Dogs Legion would have been 100x better if the Middle Earth Shadow ""Nemesis characters, nemesis forts, social vendettas and followers in computer games"" patent didn't exist. The whole ""play as anyone"" mechanic felt like it was intended to be a fun spin on the Middle Earth Shadow series' nemesis system, especially given Assassins Creed Odyssey's mercenary system also acting as a watered down nemesis system just 2 years prior. Afterall the patent describes a system in which procedurally generated NPCs exist in a hierarchy in which they interact with and remember player actions. In Watch Dogs Legion NPCs do this... Sorta... If a friendly npc is abused or abandoned too many times they betray DedSec by... Leaving your team... or if an NPC you wish to recruit is injured by you it lowers the public opinion and prevents them from joining you.

Similarly in the Middle Earth Shadow series abusing your uruks will lead to them betraying you, usually waiting for a moment of weakness to strike and attack you, often killing one of your loyal uruks in their reveal. If they escape they will remember both their betrayal and later even remark on their escape. Often times they can be rerecruited but sometimes they may gain the trait iron will, preventing them from being recruited again unless they are driven crazy. 

With a more complex system like that out there obviously it feels like the smart move to emulate what was good about it, and to improve what was bad. But Ubisoft didn't do that. Given the patent that is in place until likely 2036 (assuming Warner Brothers keeps paying for the patent), the game was forced into a watered down version of that system as to avoid infringement.

Could they have done it better without breaching the patent? Sure. But it is a difficult line to avoid crossing due to the vagueness of the patent. Afterall the patent even covers improvements on the Nemesis system that weren't even in the games. 

So what do you think? Did the Nemesis system hurt the recruit anyone mechanic of Watch Dogs Legion?",https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/1e755hv/about_the_recruit_anyone_mechanic_in_legion/,watch_dogs

So, as you might know, if you have Watch Dogs 1 bought from Steam, it might not have an access to online functions of the game due to a bug in an access-granting algorithm. As others say, your account doesn't receive a key allowing you to connect to the servers. So I'll leave here a small guide on how to get Ubisoft to grant you this access. Feel free to message me if you'll have more questions.

0. Step zero is to make sure that this is a really problem with your account and not with your network. I mean, I've just managed to access online through the laptop that is connected to Wi-Fi distributed by phone connected to mobile network, so you can easily assume it, but still because of some steps, I'd like to recommend you to check if you get the same problem on another device connected to another network. If the problem persists then almost certainly the problem is your account

1. Open a case on Ubisoft site: [Link](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/contact). It's advisable to immediately write them that your problem is persisting and most certainly have a deal with your account and the game not being bought on Ubisoft

1.5. Now you're waiting. I got the first response after **3 weeks** and it was automated warning about closing the case. Answer it however you want, just don't let the case be closed

2. After I saved the case from closing, it took other **1,5 weeks** to get a response from a real person. Now they will most certainly ask you to try various troubleshooting steps, run few tests and send them results, despite you telling them that it's a problem not with your hardware. It's normal, this is part of their instructions. It's better to send them what they're asking for. As for troubleshooting, if they ask for too much (like rerouting ports, enabling uPnP, resetting software) you can just write them that you've done it. I mean, for them it's just a checkbox, they're obliged to ask it, so why would you strain yourself because of it. You can repeat that your problem is with your account and not hardware, it won't have an immediate result, but it might lead to them turning blind eye to some tests. If you'll encounter some stubborn support that keeps you stuck on one step, just send a message after a day, you most certainly will get another support who might be more yielding.

3. Now you message them until you receive the ""golden message"". It's better to not answer anything

https://preview.redd.it/qs27arc7xhdd1.png?width=505&format=png&auto=webp&s=487769ebc108d21068bc3b513c154d12c9f9b952

4. Now I'd advise to check your mailbox daily to assure that your case won't get closed. Also check the status of it. When it changes to ""escalated"" you can stop warring and just wait for the ""specialists"" to review it

https://preview.redd.it/5j0szlroxhdd1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f75eece4d11aa516d21d59edd444c4c5d56ebc9

5. After some time (in my case a little more than **a month**) you'll receive a message that, I hope, will solve your problem

Note: The key they sent to me didn't give me a new copy of the game, it made my old copy (Steam one) that didn't have a key (can be checked in game properties in Ubisoft Launcher) receive it and gain access to multiplayer:

I've made a similar post on this topic some days ago, but here I want really to talk with you of the near or far future of For Honor.

According to you, did you think that year 8 is the last year of For Honor or the game will receive a ninth and last year? Or that the game will be developed until year 10 and then its development and updates will be stopping and the servers will be down, or, on the contrary, do you think that For Honor will be developed for again five years or even more?

Personally, I'm convinced at 70-80% that the game will have a 9 year, and certainly a year 10; maybe we gonna have a year 11 and 12 (or even a year 13, 14 and 15 in the most optimist case but I didn't believe in this eventuality myself). I think that For Honor will still have two years at least, because the games seems enough rentable for Ubisoft to continue the journey (For Honor is one of the most rentable game as a service among the Ubisoft catalog, if I didn't said mistake) and the devs have planned multiple things in term of balancing (anti gank mechanics in season 1, balance and rework of the feats in season 2...) who could be a clue that the game is not ready to die. After these two years, maybe the game will receive a few years before the shut down of the title.

In particular, the color options, or lack thereof and the change to how certain characters' eyes look.

I miss being able to have different colors for defending and attacking in game modes like dominion and breach, then a third for duel and brawl. It was in the game since release and then they get rid of it for like no good reason and make it so no matter what you're always the blue team. Then on some characters (especially the vikings, who ubisoft has been screwing over in the fashion department since the beginning) smaller details of their armor will reflect the custom colors. So a raider with natural browns and grey on their leather patches will have a bright orange rope going over their chest or stitching on a warlord's helmet. And yes, there are *some* colors that make these smaller details blend in better, maybe I want my cape or shield to reflect those colors but not those small detail pieces. I'm just out of luck because of some random change nobody wanted.

Then, more recently, I've noticed that characters with helmets now have larger, visible eyes, where before their faces were more shrouded in shadow. It looks so uncanny and frankly just bad in my opinion. It takes away from the menacing, imposing aura these characters are meant to have.

If you'd like, share your thoughts on these changes.

But on the other hand Ubi willingly shelled out the money to make this crossover happen. Which means they see for honor as a still profitable and worthwhile investment, which means we're hopefully going to keep getting new content and maybe just maybe we'll get a for honor 2 in the future.

And who knows maybe if we're really lucky we'll continue to get 2 hero skins a season.

1gbb4oj,Ea50Marduk,2024-10-25 03:29:39,My Opinion About the Recents Event and Heroes Skins.,1,0,"Hello everyone,

After the Warrior's Den of yesterday and the announces of the crossover *For Honor x Destiny 2* for the Halloween event of this year the day before, many players have explained their disappointment toward these news.

I'm fully agree with those who said that the Halloween event of this year should have been a Viking event, with an opposition between the Valhalla and Helheim like someone have said when the blue and golden rifts have been spotted in many maps, two locations in the Norse mythology closely associated with death and so which fit perfectly with Halloween. It is really disappointing and I'm really hoping if *For Honor* have a 9 year of content we will receive a new third season about Vikings with an Halloween event worthy of this faction (and with an Hero skin for Valkyrie or Varangian Guard).

For the collaboration with *Destiny 2* and the event and cosmetics that it brought to *For Honor*, the one bad opinion I have on it is the Heroes skins based on *Destiny 2* characters. Like the Ezio Auditore Peacekeeper's Skin, even if they are really cool in term of design, I'm a little worried because the initial goal of the Heroes Skins is to present characters of the world of *For Honor*, whatever they are reals or legendaries, dead or alive, knowns or unknowns, not to make the same choice as many game as a service are doing with skins. However, I'm pretty reassured wit the fact that it seems they will continue to present Heroes skins grounded into Heathmoor and *For Honor*'s world before presenting this type of collab skins in Warrior's Den, and I'm hoping (I admit I can be a little too optimistic) that this type of Heroes skins will be rare in the future.

For the rest, I relatively like the rest of the cosmetics (weapons, executions, outfits...) because *For Honor* have receive some events or contents like this in the past. Most of them was about licences of Ubisoft: *Rabbids* April Fool event in 2019, *Blades of Persia* event in 2020 which have brought weapons reskins inspired of the *Prince of Persia* licence, and of course the three *For the Creed* event (in 2018, 2022 and 2024) with its weapons reskins, outfits, effects and so on based on some of the *Assassin's Creed* games; we can added to that the *Just Dance* emote in 2020 and the symbol of *Far Cry Primal*. And finally, the famous *Star Wars* event.

Here my opinion on these topics. Even if this subject was at the center of many posts these last hours, what do you think of all of this?

1gaqt2w,TheAvgCrusader,2024-10-24 09:15:14,This Event Kinda Sucks + How It (maybe) Could've Been Better,0,1,"I know, I know, multiple text bodies long rant on the For Honor subreddit. This is already off to a bad start but just hear me out for a sec. I want this ""discussion"" to be a positive one because I don't think collabs themselves don't belong in this game. I just think there should be some ""quality assurance"", lets say.

I think the glaring issue with this Destiny collab is that there isn't a piece of it that really belongs in the For Honor universe. Destiny is a looter shooter set in the far future  that deals with the forces of the light and dark, along with the inner struggle between the two within ourselves. For Honor is a fighting game set within the medieval period where warriors across time battle each other, and more recently within the Multiplayer storyline, on the sides of Order and Chaos. There isn't much overlap between the two, most glaringly, its setting. That alone makes this collab feel awkward, add to that the Lord Shaxx and Saint-14 skins and this is looking even worse. THEN add onto that the fact this event is taking place of the Halloween event and we have a problem on our hands.

Now, all that being said I want to reiterate that I don't think collabs in For Honor are entirely a bad thing. You'd imagine that something like the Dead by Daylight collab falls into the same category as this Destiny one, but I actually think it was pretty good. It helps that the already gritty setting of Dead by Daylight fits in well with For Honor's (at times) realistic and equally gritty atmosphere. The Trapper and The Huntress (at least her mask), while somewhat ""modern"", fits into the universe for the same reason. It also helps that The Entity's whole shtick is travelling the Omniverse terrorizing different universes to sustain itself. Pocketing what ""Survivors"" and ""Killers"" it wants to subject to its trials. Then, in a perfect universe, we would've gotten Apollyon in Dead by Daylight and all would be right in the world...

I feel the same way about the Assassin's Creed collab too. While I would've personally liked it more if For Honor had it's own unique Assassin with his/her own story and Brotherhood that follows them... Ezio is fine in terms of look and feel. The Assassin's Creed series is, like For Honor, based on history. So he doesn't look out of place in the cast of characters that badly.

And, just to get it out of the way. The Shovel Knight collab was, alright? Besides being a ""Knight"" he doesn't really belong, but, I can forgive it because it's only present as a couple effects and outfits that come back every so often.

Now, on to the meat of this post...

""How could this event have been handled better?""

I know the entirety of this so far indicates that I, probably like some of you, believe this collab never should've happened. Personally, I don't think so. The universes of Destiny and For Honor both captive me and I really wanted this event to be cool. So, I'd like to present MY idea as to what this event should've been (besides it not taking the place of the Halloween event because that should be a given)

Starting with cosmetics, I don't think I would've given anyone a Hero Skin. I know they're the hot new thing Ubisoft is trying to push right now but I don't think there's any character that I could realistically see running around Heathmoor. In terms of Effects (limiting ourselves to two total), I would've based them on the Prismatic and Stasis subclasses from Destiny (I'm including Stasis because we already have enough smokey black effects and it's our best way of incorporating Darkness). They could both even have a little Ghost accompanying the player while the effect is active. Plus, maybe as a little ""Easter Egg"" if you will, if a player is downed while having either effect equipped, a Ghost will hover above the player like how they do in Destiny. When it comes to executions I would've done the same thing but I would've done way more of them. Considering class abilities are the real meat and potatoes of the Class/Subclass system in Destiny, I figure it would've made sense to have them be a main thing when it comes to this event. I would've done one execution per Subclass, being; Solar, Arc, Void, Stasis, and Strand. As for what they'd be, I'd just base them on the class Super Abilities (which is why Prismatic isn't included here), tweaked a bit where necessary. 

This is entirely personal opinion, but in terms of which ones I'd do;

- Solar : Golden Flintlock (Based on Golden Gun)
- Arc: Chaos Reach
- Void : Sentinel Shield
- Stasis : Silence and Squall
- Strand : Needlestorm

(Sorry fellow crayon munchers, we only get one)

As for the event game mode and lore, I'd change it to operate similar to the Rebellion event modes, Emperor's Escape, and the like. 

The Traveler would have come to Earth, hovering above Heathmoor, creating ""Guardians"" to fight against the hoards of The Darkness. I would have so that each Hero Class in For Honor is given a Class from Destiny. So, the Vanguards could be Arc, Heavies could be Void, etc. Then each Class would have their feats overwritten with new ones pertaining to whatever ""new"" Class they are. The game mode would consist of a mix of clearing out enemies, capturing points, and would culminate in a boss fight similar to Theater of Bones. 

If not obvious, the format of the event is meant to echo that of a Destiny raid.

I think the collab being framed this way helps it fit into the universe much better, but if you guys have any other ideas feel free to share them.

But if we analyze the level's concept + atmosphere of the first SC, they have much more potential and the game also have 2 more missions ( without Training level ). Ubisoft also will bring new improvements in gameplay, maybe even more alternative routes like CT. So the remake would not be just a copy with new visuals. 

Not forghet that the game will be released with a realistic graphic engine never seen before in the old games. Will be like playing Crysis on modern graphics with 4K, 60FPS, Ray Tracing, etc on Xbox/PS/PC.

1g97hj5,AintNoLaLiLuLe,2024-10-22 10:17:40,My humble collection and opinions on the series as a whole,140,21,"Day 1 Splinter Cell enjoyer here. This sub has become an absolute cesspool full of copium for a remake that likely won't come out so here's something different for a change.

Originally got into the series exclusively on the PS2 until I got a 360 and then PC - my PS2 copies are long gone. Here are some hot takes and opinions on each installment:

Splinter Cell: The game that started it all, and I'm very fond of it. The graphics and gameplay were unheard of at the time and I spent years playing it as a kid. I've played every version of this game and the PC version is by far the worst, mostly coming down to the awful keyboard/mouse controls. I've got the steam version, Uplay Version, PC disk, and *had* the PS2 & GBA copies at one point in time in my childhood. The best way to play is emulating the PS2 or Xbox version depending if you want the bonus levels on either platform.

Pandora Tomorrow: Weakest game in the series (minus essentials) by a longshot. Horrible controls and lack of support for modern graphics cards (Shadows only render using Voodoo graphics unless you wanna use DGVoodoo. The original SC thankfully has a fallback mode so it's less of an issue) make this game an absolute chore to play on PC. Also, Allstate Lambert sucks. I prefer emulating the PS2 version on my steam deck.

Chaos Theory: The mother of all stealth games! I've sunk quite literally thousands of hours into this game between every version. There is no understating how incredible this game is and it will always be my favourite game of all-time. The PC version is my preferred way to play after some graphics mods and fixed controller support via SCfix. It works great on my gaming PC and steam deck. Honourable mention to the NDS copy of this stellar game (I *used* to have it as a kid and loved it, fight me).

Double Agent: I know this will rustle some jimmies but the 360 version is better than the OG Xbox/PS2 copies of the game, though I really liked those ones too. The jump from Chaos Theory's already amazing graphics to DA when it came out was incredible even though I played them on a 32inch CRT way back in the day. The MP was great, although not as great as CTs. I prefer the 360 version of v1 over the PC strictly because of the bugs and frustrating amount of configuration needed on the PC. I prefer emulating the PS2 version of v2 on the steam deck.

Conviction: I was hyped for years for this game, from when it was just the tech demo we never got to play, to the revised version. Although not the strongest in the series, it was a nice change in pace and co-op/deniable ops were insane to play with my friends and on xbox live. I prefer the PC version primarily because of the graphics and framerate.

Blacklist: Hot take, this is the second best game in the series. I bought every copy of this game, including the Wii U version! Since my PS3 and Wii U copies were digital and those systems are long gone, I didn't get to picture them here. This game was the perfect combination of methodical stealth from traditional entries and the *optional* action of conviction. I've got probably well over 1000 hours between all versions of the game with 400 just in the PC version. I prefer the PC version of this game simply because of the graphics and ability to play it on my steam deck. I'm currently playing through the Chaos Theory mod and its awesome!

Play these games in order and absolutely do not start with Chaos Theory, it will ruin your appreciation for the first 2 games. I've found that if you're playing on PC only, play them like this:

SC 1&2: Emulate the PC/Xbox Versions
SCCT: Play the PC version with SCFix and other fixes here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=728093866
DA: Play the PC version with the fixes here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=935210001
Convicton: Just play the steam/uplay verison
Blacklist: Just play the steam/uplay version

Remake: I want a remake more than anyone in the world, but it's not happening with the current state of Ubisoft. Even if there was a possibility of a remake coming out, why would anyone trust modern-day ubisoft to deliver on this masterpiece of a series? We've seen where other iconic ubisoft franchises have gone in the past decade and I frankly do not want to see another entry if it's going to be full of farcry tower exploration, weak storytelling and shoehorned identity politics. The game is in development hell for a reason and if it's not going to be respectful to the rest of the series and the fans, I don't want it.

The bad thing in the whole game ? The original voice from Sam was changed, but only that not make the game ""bad"". Also was not Ubisoft ""fault"".

Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is one of the first games I ever played. It was magical, like a playable Disney movie (back when Disney was good) with engaging action and amazing unforgettable music from Stuart Chatwood.

The first few Splinter Cell games were always captivating to me. I'm stealthy at heart, and the whole secret agent spy theme always appealed greatly to me. Using all the cool gadgets and sneaking past enemies (and shooting when you have to!) was always a blast. There are some elements of the older SC games that haven't aged well at all (needing to stand still for 5 seconds to aim at a light on the ceiling only to miss anyways...) but for their time, they were great games.

And do I even need to bring up Assassin's Creed? I remember being a kid looking at gaming magazines advertising AC2, and ***I remember being hyped about the fact that Ezio could swim.*** Like, that just blew my mind. And actually playing the game was incredible. To this day, AC1 and 2 STILL have the best parkour in the entire series. Wtf, Ubisoft? You already had a high quality parkour system with great skill expression back then. As someone who's been with Ubisoft and Assassin's Creed LITERALLY since the BEGINNING, it has been HEARTBREAKING to see each game after AC2 just slowly killing the parkour system. One by one, slowly, worse and worse. God it's so disgusting.

And, well, I guess that was a rather natural segue into why I'm now *happy* that Ubisoft is going down the drain.

I'm not even going to start about what's stupid about AC Shadows (I don't know where to start. Just yikes all around.) but in general, Ubisoft's monetization has become extremely unfun. Back in the day I actually **didn't really mind** buying a cute cosmetic pack here and there. I liked the flaming horse armor in Origins. But it's a corporate joke that some of the pre-purchase packs for these games are exceeding $100 just to play the game ""early"". That's a lie and a marketing term. You're making people who **purchased your product** play it **later** because they didn't pay as much as you wanted them to. You don't incentivize people to pay more by **locking the game away from them you dolt,** you incentivize people to pay more by **providing them with greater service.**

Seeing the parkour system in AC slowly die, seeing the joke of the way their games are monetized in the last decade, and seeing their narcissistic egos falling apart in their Twitter comments when Elden Ring was new and successful have all contributed to my schadenfreude at Ubisoft's current failing state.

I'm sad, but also happy, because you aren't the Ubisoft I remember. You aren't the same quality studio that made those incredible games. You are incredibly out of touch and I am disappointed in you. I also feel bad because I'm looking forward to the Splinter Cell remake and I want it to be good and successful, but at the same time I want the studio itself to fail because they deserve it. 

Anyway.

No matter what happens.

Thank you, Ubisoft. For my childhood. For the version of the company you were back then. But I'm not sad about you failing now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Splintercell/comments/1g16qk7/i_am_both_sad_and_happy_at_the_same_time_that/,Splintercell

ill be honest

this story doesnt hold up much at all, but a lot of it is strong (i.e. Nikoladze is a solid villain) the georgian information crisis, the whole oil rig part was kinda interesting and then chinese embassy etc.

i did another replay a month back and thought Chaos Theory had a much better plot than the first.

and i love the first game, i love the missions. it could be my favourite tied with chaos theory. what got me through the first game was its amazing stealth gameplay, the missions, the atmosphere being strong. but a compelling narrative was not there. i didnt really feel that invested in the story. yeah it was nice going into cia or rescuing the abbatoir soldiers or then also sniping nikoladze in the end at presidential palace. presidential palace was amazing. cia hq and presidential are the strongest missions in the game. but the news wires inbetween missions with morris oddell were ok. this could be expanded on alot, add more/new interesting characters, change the story up to a high standard. forget the stealth gameplay for a bit, thats obviously important but splinter cell 1's story needed a lot of work and i am happy ubisoft is changing it. if i could give the original games story a mark id probably say a 6.5/10 at best. the remake has the potential to bring back the old stealth gameplay and also give a compelling narrative an amazing storyline with an interesting plot with the whole nikoladze georgia stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Splintercell/comments/1fxwt4c/did_anyone_here_actually_like_splinter_cell_1s/,Splintercell

Link: [https://x.com/KeeperNovaIce/status/1842379643548029159](https://x.com/KeeperNovaIce/status/1842379643548029159) 

Ubisoft needs to make some changes. They should consider a buyout because their recent attempts at new games resulting in failed innovation and declining profits. I hope they make necessary changes before it's too late.

Ubisoft needs a solid foundation to build upon. They already have established IPs like Assassin's Creed and Splinter Cell that could provide that foundation. It would be a waste of potential if they were to start from scratch. Instead, they should focus on reviving old IPs that their player base is eager to see return.

The most cost-effective option would be remasters or re-releases. That’s just logical sense. This will also give them an opportunity to address any problematic content in newer games. If needed, they can put certain titles on hold until these issues can be resolved or add disclaimers where appropriate if certain titles are lost to the wind.

Personally, I have a lot of love for Ubisoft and the amazing people I've met through their games. It's easy to feel frustrated with a company that has seen its downfall after once dominating the gaming industry. However, I know that even as I type this, its about the business and economic side of things. That which, if it isn’t obvious, needs to be addressed first. With that knowledge, this may also mean more layoffs in the future, with potentially half of the current staff losing their jobs.

I don't believe this is the end for Ubisoft based on evidence around me. Restructuring internally may not be a far-fetched idea given everything that has happened. And if not Tencent, someone else may eventually buy them out at this rate.

It's easy to stare into that dumpster fire and troll to high heavens. Many are unconvinced that there are human beings that still care for Ubisoft one way or another. I hope those involved don't get the short end of that stick.

The world is watching Ubisoft and I know with your negotiations... you can end up surprising us all. You have that capability. In the end; it's of your choice to so what's right.

But… what do I know? I’m just a Social Media Manager and struggling Game Developer. Anything I’ve presented is my observations and opinions, afterall.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Splintercell/comments/1fwfunl/ubisoft_is_in_need_of_dire_transformation/,Splintercell

1fvhnv3,HumActuallyGuy,2024-10-04 04:39:16,Ubisoft will probably use Splinter Cell to try to save itself ,97,151,"Everyone is mad/confused about the rumors of a Splinter Cell Blacklist Remaster when we are expecting a remake of the original SC but it makes sense given current Ubisoft status. 

I think we can all agree Ubisoft is in a bad spot. Skull and Bones and SW:Outlaws are not the big hits the investment in them would justify so now they are scrambling expecially given AC:Shadows is controversial and that might not translate in sales.

#They need a win AND FAST

So given any other project they have might be a long ways off they need something that can be done in less than a year maybe months. Given Blacklist is still a late 360/PS3 game it stands to reason they could much easily code a remaster than any of their games.

So a Blacklist Remaster makes sense if you need quick good publicity, you revive a dead franchise, make fans happy, hell, if they really want to go for gold they might rework lighting to make Blacklist more like old SC.

In summary, it's a easy win that doesn't require a lot of investment or a lot of time to make and given Ubisoft might be strapped for cash and time. It makes sense.

But yeah ... this is my take, made this post because half the posts on this sub lately have a ""it doesn't make sense"" ""why"" comments and the reasons I listed above are always brought up.

Also has a healthy amount of accessories as well. 

Sam Fisher hasn’t had a lot of action figures. The last one was probably a McFarlane Sam Fisher from Conviction. I am pretty surprised Ubisoft licensed it all of a sudden 11 years after its release, but I welcome it, especially if they can make the other games as well.

1ftqoxf,Lopsided_Rush3935,2024-10-01 23:20:43,What the SAR remake REALLY needs.,5,46,"I've compiled a list of all of the things that the new Splinter Cell remake needs to improve upon the original and that I *really* think Ubisoft should consider implementing. These are:


1). Binary visible/invisible system. Instead of Sam having the signature green infrared lights on his ops suit, they should just have him possess one singular light that indicates whether or not Sam is visible to anyone. All that darkness and monitoring visibility as a sliding scale was cool, but it was really messy and hard for the player to follow so we should make it easier for everyone. I'm sure this binary system will work fine with the various degrees of darkness that exist within the game levels.


2). Sonar goggles instead of NVGs. NVGs are now old and boring and the SC ones weren't even technologically achieved when the game's plot is set! That's not realistic! We need to revamp the vision modes. CT took it even further and made it worse by even giving the player EMF vision. It just gets too confusing for new players. What the game really needs is some supercool sonar stuff so they can see everyone as digital silhouettes. Oh, and actual sonar wouldn't be able to track their movement in real-time, but we'll include it anyway!


3). Upgrades that remove the boring minigames. Virtually every game on the planet has included lock picking and hacking minigames by now. It's stale. What Ubisoft should do is add achievable upgrades into the game that permanently and irreversibly remove the player's ability to do those minigames. I know that, traditionally, there's also a challenge element to them about time pressure to avoid alarms or patrols, but who wants to do them? Not the people who buy and play stealth games.


4). Speed up the gameplay pace generally. Sam moves around the levels like a babushka in the original and it completely kills the flow and tension. The atmosphere of being a cool spy is lost. What Ubisoft need to do is make Sam have the physicality of a super soldier who can sprint and scale walls with no slowing down or signs of fatigue. Get rid of those annoying grunting noises he makes in the original when climbing on ledges and pipes (it's not even that hard to do!)


5). Silent conversation. The conversations in the original games was fun sometimes but it gets really distracting from the actual objectives of the level. Besides, who wants to hear some Jewish men talk in a language they can't understand or listen to some guys talk about a weird animal they saw? It's a load of voice recording and scriptwriting for nothing. Instead, they should maybe make the guards *look* like they're conversing but just have it be entirely silent even if Sam is standing right next to them.


6). Gradual detection build-up with a 360° HUD radial indicator. The behaviour of the guards noticing things should mirror real life (remember, it's supposed to be REALISTIC!). Instead of seeing things suddenly and having a tense music cue erupt from the situation, there should be a little indicator that pops up to show the player that Sam is *gradually* being noticed by someone so that they can move and avoid consequences. Also, Unisoft should pair this with a kind of metallic screeching/bleeping noise for when Sam is really about to sbe detected. I just think that's really what's needed to create tension.


7). More action pieces. The best parts of stealth films are always the action scenes, like when Agent 47 has that sword fight in Hitman (2007). Ubisoft should really consider adding more of these into the game. Maybe one per level like what PT almost tried to do. In fact, they should have Sam never holster his firearm so that he's constantly prepared for a firefight.


8). Trending-genre soundtrack. Instead of staying to tradition, Ubisoft should compose the soundtrack based around current musical trends. Nightcore maybe, or trap remixes of older SC tracks, or maybe some mumble rap type beats.


9). A crossbow and a funky Karamabit knife. Idk. I just think Sam should have them. They're cool, right?


10). No interrogations. We can have like, maybe a few ones that are basically just cutscenes? We'll give the player a choice in them that's like killing vs. pacifism, but it won't actually change anything about the gameplay because that's just too much. The interrogations in the original SC's before are just silly. Like, Sam can interrogate a soldier right next to another guard and they don't hear it?!

The key points here are that Ubi is holding back their talent by basically putting restrictions on what their devs can create, in order to not offend anyone. Then there's the fact that they are prioritizing management roles over developer roles, and on top of that, the people in management don't know sh*t about what the gamers actually want, and don't care, and it has been clear in the past that they don't care about player feedback. Then you have the obvious, sh*tty workplace culture at Ubi. 

In terms of a new SC game? Even if there was one, you can bet it would be bad. And any remakes are just going to be at the bottom of the list until Ubisoft starts selling acceptable units of video games. Hell they couldn't even get the Japanese AC game that everyone's been wanting for years right, and all they keep doing is trying to defend themselves about the way they have been bastardizing Japanese culture in AC Shadows. They only used the feud Japan era for profit. SW Outlaws turned out to be a mid game because of all the reasons listed above and more, especially the part where they can't offend anyone, so they play it safe.

And also wouldn’t be surprised if 2027 was an option because the project was greenlit at the end of 2021.

1fm78xp,ShoulderAdvanced6854,2024-09-22 00:45:33,THEORY: Liev Schreiber will voice Sam Fisher in the Splinter Cell Remake,46,16,"To elaborate on an earlier comment I posted in another thread, my theory is that Liev Schreiber will continue to voice Sam Fisher in the Splinter Cell Remake. 

In an interview back in August, which was posted on Screen Rant, Michael Ironside stated that he is reaching 75 years old, and that he thinks he is too old to play Sam Fisher. Sure he had a voice role in Ghost Recon Wildlands & Breakpoint, but with his age and health issues, including his cancer back when Splinter Cell: Blacklist was in development, this is the right choice. 

The man himself, Michael Ironside, is saying he is too old to play the character, then Ubisoft should recast Sam Fisher’s voice. And Liev Schreiber’s voice in his roles in TV and Movies alongside the teaser for Netflix’s Splinter Cell: Deatheatch prove his voice is one the closest Michael Ironside-like voices for Sam Fisher that we will get. We had Eric Johnson in Blacklist, Jeff Teravainen as “Zero” in Rainbow Six: Siege, and Nigel Barber in Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix. Liev Schreiber sounds the most like Michael Ironside’s iconic voice for Sam Fisher. 

By announcing Liev Schreiber as Sam Fisher in the Netflix anime early on, it’ll get people used to his voice, so that when the Splinter Cell Remake is announced it won’t be as hard of a blow for people who desperately want Ironside back. And this is going on the assumption that fans really like his voice for Sam Fisher once the anime releases. So, Anime first and then the remake after. 

I believe Ubisoft would rather have fans hear the same voice actor for Sam Fisher rather than keep recycling through different voice actors all the time. 

Now I could be entirely wrong. I initially thought Ubisoft would get Michael Ironside back for the Remake, but since it sounds like it he doesn’t want to voice Sam Fisher anymore, then I don’t think he would voice him in the remake. And initially I thought Liev Schreiber was a one time exception because he’s in the anime. Ubisoft could always choose someone else for the Remake besides Ironside or Schreiber, but I feel the timing of the eventual releases of the anime and Remake lends itself well for Schreiber to play Sam Fisher in both projects.

Thus, here is my amateur attempt to try to bring attention to them.  If any of you can muster better quality images, by all means, please share.

So here are some thoughts I have on them.  First, I think their suit should've been unlockable as a bonus award in-game.  It's a pretty practical suit design for the most part, aside from the questionable number of rope anchor points (I counted at least 5 on the harness, including the back).  In fact, it kinda reminds me of Sam's Penthouse/Battery suit from SCCT.  I didn't find most of the unlockable 4E suit aesthetics appealing, so I'd be up for wearing this suit as a change of pace.  Wouldn't it be funny in-lore, if Sam intentionally dressed up like his elite enemies to mess with them?  Perhaps a minor detection bonus could be added, where NPCs need to see him closer to realize he's not one of them.

Second, I think Ubisoft was quite inconsistent with the Voron levels and enemy outfits.  You see, absolutely none of the Voron suits from Conviction were used despite two Briggs missions taking place at a Voron station in Bangladesh and a Voron blacksite in Russia.  What did I find in those missions?  Thermal goggle equipped commandos... dressed exactly like these Blacklist guys... with the same Iranian accents and the same guns from the main campaign.  It wouldn't have killed Ubisoft to bring back some of Kestrel's suits from Conviction to flesh out what Voron's agency looks like outside of his perspective.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1flu0fa,Splintercell

1f7jodl,bshar_shahen,2024-09-03 06:18:31,My thoughts Splinter Cell,12,11,"A while ago, I have played the masterpiece metal gear solid 5 The phantom pain, just after playing it, and realizing how good it was, I wanted more, so I played the first MGS game in the series timeline, MGS 3 Snake eater, and I was... super disappionted, I don't mean it's a bad game, actually somehow 99% of the stealth mechanics in MGS5 was also emplemented in MGS3 (2004), buttt!!! It was also with a control scheme thats basically a piece of sh#t, and I don't know about old OG gamers that played this game, but for me I couldn't enjoy it at all, that's why I looked farward to play splinter cell, as it seamed to have a pretty good stealth mechanics just like MGS3, but with better control scheme, so I thought, Is this the match up for MGS5?, and I bought it on the first discount.

Now, let me explain the 3 factors that make a great stealth game for me, and maybe also for many people:

* First factor: the protagonist powers/tools must be cool so that you feel like a god damned badass when play as him.
* Second factor: the AI must be smart enough, if it was stupid, then the you'll be messing around with it's stupidity instead of actually being afraid of getting spotted.
* Third factor: the game must have some kind of freedom of choice in completing it's objective and dealing with different scenarios against the enemies, if the game didn't have this, the only thing that you are actually trying to do, is to understand what the developer exactly wanted you to do in the scenario you're facing, which is stupid and boring.

So let's look at splinter cell and see if it fulfills those factors.

First of all, sam fisher is god damned badass, the way he talks, interegates people, his cool jumps that unfortunately wasn't emplemented in a very good way into the gameplay, and his tools which you surprisingly don't see very often in modern stealth games, the ability to destroying lights and hiding in the darkness, the night vision, the sticky camera, the optic cable, his tools and the way it's used in the gameplay really makes you feel like a splinter cell, which is badass, so the first factor is clearly a checked, and to the next.

Now for the AI, compared to newer ubisoft titles, it's not just ""better"" than newer titles, they're f#cking genuises, they get attracted to sounds, see anything outside darkness and even if it was inside darkness they can see it if it was close enough, whether it was you or a corpse, if they came into a place with no lights but they knew it had lights they will start searching it, and turn it on if it was just turned of, basically, compared to modern trashy stealth games, they are genuises, which is crazy, if you compared them to assassing creed mirage for example, you will find them to be much smarter, and yet this game is 21 years older than mirage, WTF ubisoft?!!.

And finally, for the last factor that made so damn sad about this game, which is the choices, nearly every scenario in this game, is designed to be solved in ONE WAY!!, and only one way, if you tried somthing else and it worked, it is probably just a glitch, or luck, only the last three missions had scenarios where I can say that they had a couple of ways to solve them, and this is sad to be honest, this kills the replay value, and kills the game it self as a stealth game and makes it so boring to the point where I was forcing my self to play.

For the verdict, I ain't got much to say, splinter cell is a game that had almost all factors for being an amazing stealth game, but it was killed by it's linearity, I am planning to play chaos thoery after this game, as I have seen some people saying that it solved the problem of linearity in this game, and I hope they are correct, because if they aren't, I would have to admit that stupid kojima is the best, which is something I don't wanna do.

And if someone read all these stupid thoughts of mine, thank you, and I hope that you share your thoughts about the first game and chaos theory (without spoilers please).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Splintercell/comments/1f7jodl/my_thoughts_splinter_cell/,Splintercell

The OG Xbox DA is strange. It looks like Chaos Theory with another color palette and a slight reduction in resolution. So many of the ideas and animations (including the Japan kidnapping/torture animations from chaos theory which I found very lazy and lame ) and the sound is not mixed well and there's numerous glitches. Enemies see you when you're hidden. It's crazy a game as polished as CT was followed by this. And yet it's so so good!!

Also, the game itself feels like Pandora Tomorrow and also reminds me a lot of the original game too, which I find very odd. bc didn't Ubi Montreal make OG DA and Shanghai made Pandora Tomorrow? 

Something about the vibe of OG DA is strange. It feels like the first 2 games had a weird baby with CT.  It doesn't feel complete or finished, and definitely not made with the same love as CT. But it's really good and better than the 360 version that's for damn sure.

The game looks okay, but its stealth seems to be a diluted, rehashed Blacklist/Conviction kind of affair. The pet sidekick acts as a living, breathing drone with something which is more or less 'sonar vision'. 

Especially in context of the SC1 Remake. Ubi, please STOP this. Enough with the friggin'drones! RF signal, point-to-point line of sight or wifi, all of these drone signals are prone to interception.

Sure, we could argue a sticky cam is also prone to signal interception...BUT that can not be compared because it's a static object once deployed and its signal transmission is usually for a very brief moment. 

Drones & sonar vision however, both wave a giant red flag that screams ""HELLO! My position is right HERE!"" for extended time and especially drone usage affects direct situational awareness. 

So Ubisoft, please limit the scouting arsenal to just sticky cams - which are already a stretch tbh. Just stop it with the effing drones. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Splintercell/comments/1f2cqr0/ubis_drone_fetishcrutch/,Splintercell

1eqdywn,Grimfangs,2024-08-12 21:38:03,[SPOILERS] Was Pandora Tomorrow Shetland's first attempt or did the developers just change direction at a later stage in production?,24,6,"I recently played Pandora Tomorrow a while ago and I noticed a lot of plot points pointing towards the plot of Chaos Theory in the cutscenes and even in the in-game data as well as the communications that Lambert has with Sam after he successfully obtains a piece of information.

**CAUTION: Spoliers ahead. If you haven't played Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory yet, what I'm about to write might spoil the games for you. You have been warned.**

The cinematics and the data gleaned from the latter levels of the game actually point at the plot of Chaos Theory.

For one thing, the threat of the Japanese I-SDF is already being addressed through multiple, albeit minor, sections of the news. Furthermore, one of the characters in the game, the CIA double agent working as Suhadi Sadono's pilot, passes on intelligence to Sam about the rising threat of the Japanese I-SDF in a side-mission for the CIA during the Refinery level in Kundang, Indonesia. With the secrecy of the I-SDF combined with the fact that a double agent working undercover in Sadono's Guerilla Group should have no first-hand knowledge of it suggests that they had ties with Sadono as well. Given the hindsight granted by Chaos Theory, either Shetland was already in on the plot. There's more evidence to support this from the very next level. However, this point might all be a stretch and it could just be an independent occurrence altogether that held no bearing whatsoever on the matter at hand. However, it is still odd that a field agent would report it to the CIA agent who is in charge of handling the case regarding Darah Dan Doa.

The next mission involves us breaking into the Darah Dan Doa Submarine pen in Komodo, Indonesia. While our objective is to further trace the call that Sadono made using his codeword, what we discover is that the people facilitating the infiltration of Darah Dan Doa onto US Soil are none other than Displace International. This proves that Displace had also been involved in this entire mess. *That being said, the game immediately backtracks in the debriefing screen and replaces 'Displace International' with 'White Knight Security,' a name that shall remain merely a placeholder and a loose end as they are never investigated at the end of the game. While this evidence suggests that it might have just been the Devs backtracking on their decision and reallocating the tale to Chaos Theory instead, it could also be one of Displace International's subsidiaries.*

To further fuel the fire, we have Shetland's initial involvement in the US Embassy to Dili, a fact that makes even Sam suspicious, foreshadowing the grand scheme of things. To Shetland's credit though, he was still instrumental in neutralising the threat of the Triple D Guerillas.

My personal theory is that Pandora Tomorrow was Shetland's first attempt at scaring the US into reform. He never wanted the attack to be successful, but rather threaten the Government into changing their ways, essentially playing Sadono for his gain. However, when that failed, he turned to the Masse Kernels to play his own little Chaos Theory in the namesake.

However, what's more likely is that they were running with Chaos Theory's story until the head honchos decided to let Pandora Tomorrow be a standalone game and use the story for CT instead and Ubisoft Shanghai just didn't bother to correct the cinematics or the data in the game, probably because of time constraints among other things, like with the original Splinter Cell.

Perhaps people who have read the books, especially 'Operation Barracuda' could shed some more light onto it.

1epggpp,DependentKey6723,2024-08-11 17:05:06,Properly explaining my lawrence williams/tom reed headcanon this time ,17,29,"Disclaimer: Another user recently posted that williams should have been the villain of conviction, it reminded me of my old headcanon, and how i didn't really explain it properly, so thats why i post this amendment to it


I headcanon them as the same guy, but really i just think ubisoft should retcon them as one or the other (e.g erase williams and retroactively replace him with reed, or erase reed and have it how it was set up to be in essentials and DAv2 with williams as the villain of conviction), but a crazy headcanon will suffice for now


Reasons I have:

I mean they have similarities like how they both have friends in high places: reed's are galliard and meggido, for williams, his bio in essentials 
mentioned that he has at least one influential patron in the upper reaches of the government (possibly was gonna be revealed as galliard w/ meggido)

- they both made sweeping changes to the agency and its operations: reeds is obvious lmao, williams bio in essentials mentioned unknown sweeping changes to the agency and its operations (possibly set up for conviction)

- they both order their operatives to unnecessarily kill: reed orders Archer to assassinate his partner, williams orders fisher (and an unknown agent) to assassinate jba members (mainly their figureheads), even though it'd be pretty easy to just leave em for the cops, note that they both could possibly have had their reasons for these hit orders though 

- another thing is it might be that they both have some kind of dislike for lambert and his ways of doing things, williams got him outed and killed, and then changed the agency, when he mentioned old 3E, reed didn't seem to like lamberts direction of third echelon, and we see that in his obvious changes 


Also note this: williams design is inconsistent (in DA, he's balding with glasses and has dark hair (wow dark hair kinda like reed haha), and in essentials he has lighter and longer hair and doesn't wear glasses (wow long hair and doesn't wear glasses kinda like reed haha), so it's kinda no surprise his name would get changed alongside his design if you were to believe all this 

Also note (2): in V1 Williams oddly is after fisher at the end even though he himself kinda seemed to compliment fisher (according to what hisham said in shanghai)

Also note (3): the third image I provided is of concept art of reed, note how he has glasses (wow glasses kinda like williams haha), it doesn't seem to have evolved from 07 conviction (maybe the cufflinks?) which had reed look way different from either williams or final reed (see the leaked ds version of conviction, theres a longplay of it on youtube, 07 reed looks like a military officer or something), to me, the concept art does look a teensy bit like a fusion between williams and final reed lmao

It just seems to me that they redesigned williams in name (as in reusing the name of an entirely different character from the beta a.k.a the ""Tom Reed"" that was gonna be a field runner in 07 conviction) and looks (a sleeker and cooler look to fit with the conviction we got, personally i prefer the more bureaucratic/corporate look that we got in DA), then later that community manager made that excuse of ""oh reed just got williams fired""

The Burma subplot in the original game with Kong Feirong was an interesting twist that moved the narrative forward but it fear in 2025 or whenever this game will be released the higher ups at Ubi will look to cut or heavily modify this important segment of the game due to Chinese censorship pressures.

From what I understand, Blacklist's ""poor"" sales were largely attributed to the game being released at a bad time, near the end of the PS3/360 console  era, when next-gen consoles were on the verge of being released.

Hitman Absolution, which came out 1 year before Blacklist, did an HD version for modern consoles and people still play it to this day, despite it being a lackluster Hitman title. I don't see why Ubisoft, which is actively working on a new SC game by all accounts, doesn't see it in their interests to simply remaster the game for modern players. I'm playing it now on Xbox Series S and it looks gorgeous; a little added framerate would go a long way.

This is one of the reasons I'm so pessimistic about the new SC remake, aside from all the other flack Ubisoft gets for other general reasons. They seem to not care about the IP's past, or it's present, identity. I want to believe that the remake is being made with Chaos Theory in mind, or Blacklist at the very least. But with all the other 360 or even PS2 titles that have seen HD updates in the past few years (Hitman Blood Money for instance), the fact that Ubi doesn't even see it as feasible to barely upgrade the already-existent latest version of SC they already have, is wild to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Splintercell/comments/1ecej58/why_cant_they_do_an_hd_blacklist_for_gods_sake/,Splintercell

1duihyk,The_Raven_Is_Howling,2024-07-04 00:23:07,Double Agent v1 revisited + missions ranking,7,6,"After my traumatic first playthrough several years ago, I thought it was time to revisit the ~~buggy mess~~ fourth installment, in all its 4K PC glory. And I'm glad I did. The game looks stunning, sounds even better, and the widescreen fix fixes more than just the resolution and aspect ratio. It actually made the game playable, even though I had some crashes here and there, some gadgets didn't upgrade, the safecracking minigame is buggy, and the audio just mutes itself sometimes. In any case, I would encourage those who have been putting a playthrough off to give it a try in 2024. It almost plays like a normal game now!

Mission ranking:

**11**. Coast Guard Boat: Incredibly short and linear. Even getting access to it is tricky and I don't know how anyone could have figured out the procedure without a guide or by just stumbling upon it by accident.

**10**. Ellsworth Penitentiary: I have to give it to them for trying to make a level without your gear interesting. Sadly, it became a trend in the later games. It's a pretty basic level, and especially considering how much more interesting it is in v2, it has to rank low.

**9**. Iceland: Given that the tutorial is a separate thing in the main menu, Iceland throws you immediately into action. There's not much of it though, and the level in quite short. Plus, the ending makes no sense.

**8**. JBA HQ - Part 4: Depending on your choice at the beginning of the level, this can play very differently. Finally taking the whole organisation out is cathartic, so the mission succeeds on that front. The base being on alert and playing through the same areas for the fourth time, though, knocks it down the ranking. It just doesn't feel as good as the other three.

**7**. Kinshasa: With the widescreen fix it becomes less of a nightmare, so my experience this time around was much more pleasant. It is a huge level split in 3 parts. The first part in the hotel is great. And that's where the good things end with this one.

**6**. JBA HQ - Part 1: The first three of the JBA missions are not too dissimilar. You only have access to a few areas in the first one so it's my least favourite of the first three variants.

**5**. JBA HQ - Part 3: Whoever designed that cube decryption minigame need to be sent to Ellsworth.

**4**. Sea of Okhotsk: Decently sized level, with the added blizzard effect to spice things up. But the level design of the ship is pretty bland and boring, a far cry from Chaos Theory's cargo ship mission.

**3**. JBA HQ - Part 2: Probably the best of the JBA missions. The minigame is tolerable at least, and sneaking around recording voice samples is pretty badass.

**2**. Cozumel: They must really like ships in Ubi Shanghai, there are three ship missions in the game, and this one is without a doubt the best. In terms of aesthetics, it's off the charts. There's shadowy areas, lit areas, loud and quite ones. A bit of everything.

- Developed by the OG team at Ubisoft Montreal, with a proper AAA budget you allot to your other yearly cash cows and the GaaS trial and errors.

- Runs on Ubisoft's Snowdrop or most preferably, UE5.

- Singleplayer heavily inspired by the OG & Chaos Theory.

- Set after the events of Dragonfire.

- Designed/Directed and Written by Clint Hocking.

- Music/Sound Design by Amon Tobin & Jesper Kyd.

- Ghost/Classic, the ONLY playstyle, no Panther/Assault.

- Do anything to discourage running. Crouch walking slower game design, like the original trilogy.

- Mark & Execute fully removed. Only manual kills.

- Alert/discovery ring removed.

- Game Over if 3 alerts per level (includes retroactively found unhidden dead bodies) and if discovered.

- Last known position removed, classic realtime AI.

- Light meter returns, no more B&W saturation visibility.

- Sound meter returns, uses current generation binaural audio, with destructible environments/debris to walk over.

- SC20K returns and replaces the SC4000, with classic attachments, along with the Five-Seven. The only starting weapons in your loadout. Built-in on/off flashlight on both weapons, and on Sam's body. On-site procurement of enemy weapons is possible, of course.

- Sticky cam. Camera/Distraction noises/sleeping gas.

- Grenades: Frag/Smoke/Sleeping Gas.

- No second character of perspective switch, during main solo campaign. Third-Person View only, Sam alone.

- More indoor areas than the last 3 mainline titles, especially during or after the middle of the night.

- Retcon Lambert's fate, like Sarah was bought back.


MULTIPLAYER:

- Spies vs Mercenaries Classic, not class based & 5 v 5.

- Team Deathmatch Classic

- Extraction

- Co-Op missions featuring Kestrel and Briggs. Needless to say, bring Kestrel back and retcon his death. It's tone deaf to kill a fan favorite character, off screen, no matter what the plotline was.

As a gamer who grew up on the old Assassins creed games
AC1, AC2, Brotherhood, Revelations 
Such foundation lead me to Splintercell conviction, through conviction i learnt of double agent, CT, pandora tommorrow and blacklist. 

And i loooved them. 
I became hooked on the games Ubi were putting out, GRAW, GRAW2 future soldier, if its Ubi related chances are ive played it. 


But its gotten to a point for me where i watch a gameplay trailer of something new, i cant enjoy it. 
Because what i see is Ubi playing it safe.

They allowed splintercell to Die. 
Infact judging by their new star wars game to come out i DARE judge and say half the movement from that game is just Re-used splinter cell animations
And with that leads me to my next point. 

Ever since AC originals they turned AC into a clunky video game. 

I realise acs always had a bit of a clunky system 
But i say the earlier work was due to hardware limitations, but they dropped unity what was fluid, dynamic, responsive. 

To then go back to this mess of a system. 
Not to mention AC shadows, basically ripping for honors combat animations. Which looks clunky and messy. 

I just feel as if Ubisoft have settled into being the new EA or 2K games. 
Peddling out the same crap with a new addition to the title 😂
Anyway thanks for getting this far.

I consider all of those franchises and Splinter Cell franchise interconnected through some of the lore and mechanics. 

I've played through pretty much all games from the franchises that I listed above besides Splinter Cell. So, week ago I started my adventure with splinter cell. Today I finished the first title from this series and already bought rest of the franchise. 

As a stealth player I was really impressed with this game, I didn't expect it to be that good and satisfying. My only complaint is the fact that Sam shoots like star wars stormtrooper, but besides that it was something truly fun while completely new for me. 

It is sad that Ubisoft has somewhat abandoned this franchise, yet I see that ghost of Sam Fisher sometimes haunts developers, because they are still using many ideas from Splinter Cell in other games (for example upcoming AC Shadows).

Now after finishing this game I want every single stealth game implement those ideas, seriously.

**What we know so far:**

It was announced on 15th December 2021 that the first game in the series - Splinter Cell (2002) will get a remake. It will be built from the ground up using the Snowdrop engine. Game will ***not*** become open-world. With this remake, developers aim to build a solid base for the future of the series. (Source: [Splinter Cell Remake Begins Development at Ubisoft Toronto](https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4adJLuhgYrPboHAPRfK7Oz/splinter-cell-remake-begins-development-at-ubisoft-toronto).) On the same date, a retrospective announcement [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH1_ZCSf_HY) was also uploaded.

Developers strive to make the game playable without a single kill if at all possible. They want to scale back the harshness of alarms, and give the player more opportunities to de-escalate the situation. They have read the [open letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TaxVlnfcGVy56oQt4HHlCopUOAfAqATFF7IqT7zm5wM/edit) posted in this subreddit. (Source: [Splinter Cell – Celebrating 20 Years of Stealth Action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfJpSeit3zI)). On this 20th anniversary of the series - [early concept arts](https://imgur.com/a/b7lKeb9) were also revealed.

1gcxaqe,LeoPines_12,2024-10-27 07:00:58,"Prince of Persia The Lost Crown did NOT underperform, Ubisoft had crazy expectations",252,111,"

As we know, a sequel to Prince of Persia The Lost Crown got cancelled and the team behind it disolved and put to work on other titles such as a Rayman remake. The reasoning behind was that the game underperformed as it didn't greet Ubisoft's expectations.

And here's the thing, it's not that the game underperformed, it's that Ubisoft's expectations were INSANE.

According to sources, Prince of Persia The Lost Crown sold 1 million copies during the past 9 months, which let's be real, are not bad sales for a metroidvania, let alone from a game that not only was on a Ubisoft suscription day one on PC and Xbox, but also came from a franchise that had been dead for 14 years.

So why did Prince of Persia The Lost Crown did not greet Ubisoft expectations?

Because, according to Tom Henderson, they expected Metroid Dread's total numbers....on release date.

They expected Prince of Persia The Lost Crown to sell 3 million copies on release.

So you understand why this is so crazy and unreallistic, the three most successful metroidvanias of the decade in sales were:

Metroid Dread: 3 million copies in 2 years

Hollow Knight: 3 million copies in 2 years

Ori franchise: 10 million copies in almost 9 years combining TWO games, Blind Forest + Will of the Wisps

They expected Prince of Persia The Lost Crown to sell on release the same ammount the top games of the genre took 2 fricking years to achieve. Heck, they expected the game to sell almost DOUBLE of what their latest hit, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, did, cause on release week, it sold 1,8 million, and yet they expected 3 millions, from a metroidvania no less. That's asking the game to sell the same as a God of War or Spider-Man videogame, which is beyond insane.

So, yeah, the game didn't flop, it's Ubisoft who definitely have no idea the market or the public they sold the game to. Hopefully in another year or so, the game will reach those 3 millions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PrinceOfPersia/comments/1gcxaqe/prince_of_persia_the_lost_crown_did_not/,PrinceOfPersia

Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is one of the first games I ever played. It was magical, like a playable Disney movie (back when Disney was good) with engaging action and amazing unforgettable music from Stuart Chatwood.

The first few Splinter Cell games were always captivating to me. I'm stealthy at heart, and the whole secret agent spy theme always appealed greatly to me. Using all the cool gadgets and sneaking past enemies (and shooting when you have to!) was always a blast. There are some elements of the older SC games that haven't aged well at all (needing to stand still for 5 seconds to aim at a light on the ceiling only to miss anyways...) but for their time, they were great games.

And do I even need to bring up Assassin's Creed? I remember being a kid looking at gaming magazines advertising AC2, and ***I remember being hyped about the fact that Ezio could swim.*** Like, that just blew my mind. And actually playing the game was incredible. To this day, AC1 and 2 STILL have the best parkour in the entire series. Wtf, Ubisoft? You already had a high quality parkour system with great skill expression back then. As someone who's been with Ubisoft and Assassin's Creed LITERALLY since the BEGINNING, it has been HEARTBREAKING to see each game after AC2 just slowly killing the parkour system. One by one, slowly, worse and worse. God it's so disgusting.

And, well, I guess that was a rather natural segue into why I'm now *happy* that Ubisoft is going down the drain.

I'm not even going to start about what's stupid about AC Shadows (I don't know where to start. Just yikes all around.) but in general, Ubisoft's monetization has become extremely unfun. Back in the day I actually **didn't really mind** buying a cute cosmetic pack here and there. I liked the flaming horse armor in Origins. But it's a corporate joke that some of the pre-purchase packs for these games are exceeding $100 just to play the game ""early"". That's a lie and a marketing term. You're making people who **purchased your product** play it **later** because they didn't pay as much as you wanted them to. You don't incentivize people to pay more by **locking the game away from them you dolt,** you incentivize people to pay more by **providing them with greater service.**

Seeing the parkour system in AC slowly die, seeing the joke of the way their games are monetized in the last decade, and seeing their narcissistic egos falling apart in their Twitter comments when Elden Ring was new and successful have all contributed to my schadenfreude at Ubisoft's current failing state.

I'm sad, but also happy, because you aren't the Ubisoft I remember. You aren't the same quality studio that made those incredible games. You are incredibly out of touch and I am disappointed in you. I also feel bad because I'm looking forward to the Splinter Cell remake and I want it to be good and successful, but at the same time I want the studio itself to fail because they deserve it. 

Anyway.

No matter what happens.

Thank you, Ubisoft. For my childhood. For the version of the company you were back then. But I'm not sad about you failing now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PrinceOfPersia/comments/1g16qtp/i_am_both_sad_and_happy_at_the_same_time_that/,PrinceOfPersia

**Fix the game launcher:**  
Regedit @ ""Computer\\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Ubisoft\\\[game name\]\\\[version\]""

* Add or Edit parameter ""llang"" (value = ""EN"" for English. I haven't tested another language. This parameter is optional in some of these games, you may not need to add/edit it)
* Add or Edit parameter ""Product\_Executable"" (value = ""PrinceOfPersia.exe"")
* Add or Edit parameter ""Product\_Path"" (value = Full path of the game's root folder)
* Add or Edit parameter ""Profiles\_Path"" (value = Full path of the save folder. I personally set it to the game's root folder)

Use Universal Widescreen (UniWS) Patcher:

It works fine with 1920x1080px, but it didn't work for 3440x1440px.  
Then select the new resolution in-game.

**Fix some settings for DirectX 9, Fog and UI Stretching:**  
I included a working ""Hardware.INI"" file for each of these games.

**Fix the physics bugs related to FPS:**  
The games physics bug at 60FPS and more.  
Ex: in Warrior Within, in the Water Tower Garden, we are supposed to climb a structure, but the prince can't wall run it vertically or does but doesn't grab onto the top.

* Limit FPS for POP/POP2/POP3.EXE in nVidia Control Panel to 30-59
* Set screen refresh rate to 60Hz (if you need to)
* Set V-Sync ON/OFF in-game after testing which works best for you

Since the games were released in the PS2 days, I set FPS to 30.

**Setup your controllers manually in-game:**

* Sands of Time and Warrior Within work fine with Xbox controllers, whether real or virtual device (I tested DS4Windows but x360ce v4 should be fine too. x360ce v3 didn't work neither with my DualShock4 nor my generic controller)
* The Two Thrones doesn't work well with Xbox controllers, prefer a generic controller without x360ce

**Get better colors:**  
Use ReShade:  
[https://reshade.me/](https://reshade.me/)  
I included 2 presets (.INI files), one for SoT & T2T, and another for WW.

You can download my config (zipped .INI files) here:

You should now have an acceptable gaming experience playing or replaying these great classics.

Enjoy!

Notes:

* I checked a lot of YouTube videos during my search, but the most important one is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaCXGVMFh4Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaCXGVMFh4Y)
* The hint about high FPS breaking the physics, I read in forums somewhere while searching.
* I tested a few Remaster Mods but they broke the games, they inject textures at runtime but since I have the Ubisoft Connect version, the games executables POP/POP2/POP3.EXE don't work directly, you have to launch the games through PrinceOfPersia.EXE, and setting up the injector to target these launchers causes crashes 2 out of 3 times, so the games usually play in Safe Mode, and the textures and models look buggy in-game.
* I tested a lot of ReShade presets, but the ones that worked best for me, after I manually edited them to remove RTGIss, are [https://www.nexusmods.com/princeofpersiathesandsoftime/mods/3](https://www.nexusmods.com/princeofpersiathesandsoftime/mods/3) and [https://www.nexusmods.com/princeofpersiawarriorwithin/mods/8](https://www.nexusmods.com/princeofpersiawarriorwithin/mods/8)",https://www.reddit.com/r/PrinceOfPersia/comments/1fu4ony/how_to_enjoy_the_prince_of_persia_sands_of_time/,PrinceOfPersia

4). Sands Of Time: A solid entry with a nice whimsical storybook tone and some cool puzzles. A little rough around the edges with repetitive combat (and the yelling British palace guard...), but still a fun game with a nice atmosphere.

3). The Two Thrones: Does a good job of reconciling the Prince's more lighthearted old self with the darker, combat hardened aspects of his personality from the events of Warrior Within. I think it's a good direction narratively for the Prince to grow wiser by trying to restore the principled aspects of himself from SoT while eschewing the naivety, and embracing the resilient aspects of his personality from WW while trying to overcome the desensitization and proclivity to rash decisions from anger. Unfortunately, as a result, the game's tone is less memorable/distinguished compared to its predecessors; SoT having a whimsical tone and WW having a dark tone. Great level design and atmosphere, though dialog is a bit cringe at times.

2) The Lost Crown: My expectations were low upon reveal of a modern Ubisoft PoP game, but I'm happy to say that this game is phenomenal and exceeded all expectations. Easily Ubi's best game in a long time. It's a true to form, proper PoP game. Great environments, puzzles, atmosphere, and surprisingly good combat. Combat hasn't been this good in PoP since WW. I'd also highly recommend playing the game in Farsi/Persian; it gives the same feeling as Ghost of Tsushima in Japanese. I haven't quite finished it yet, but it's rare for me to look forward to the next playthrough of a game while on my first playthrough, but The Lost Crown has achieved this.

1). Warrior Within: I'll admit, I was initially put off by the try-hard, edgy tone of WW (and to an extent, it still feels a bit much at times), but I fairly quickly was able to overlook some of the more off putting aesthetic choices (like the comically scantily clad women characters that were just scantily clad for the sake of it, or the Prince's conceited boasting in combat, which can somewhat be excused by the extreme circumstances the Prince was in). I liked the Middle Eastern tinged metal soundtrack (as a metal fan, myself), the grim Middle Eastern/Gothic fused atmosphere, and the legitimately tense and desperate feel of the circumstances of the game. The tone effectively portrays the Prince's desperation. The interconnected level design was also genius. The layout reminds of Dark Souls 1, the way the world loops around on itself. Outside of some of the try-hard edginess, occasionally annoying sound effects (i.e Shahdee's screaming, or those shouting teleporting demons, etc.), and middling to poor boss fights, Warrior Within is probably the most viscerally affecting entry in the franchise.

I'm writing this as an honest inquiry about the history involved, here. I was never a Prince of Persia fan before now, but I picked up Lost Crown yesterday and I am absolutely in love. I've always been a massive fan of Metroid, and this REALLY scratches that itch.

  
Anyways, from the context clues given here, I'm assuming that the game takes place in later Achaemenid Persia, some time prior to Alexander the Great. (late 300ish BCE?) I was very interested to see that much of Mt Qaf's inscriptions were written in cuneiform -- could the city date back to the Neo Assyrian period? But then I saw that many of the earlier inscriptions were referring to Darius the Great, which indicates that it's only a couple hundred years old.

  
This confused me a bit. I know that the Achaemenid Persians still used cuneiform on occasion -- I -THINK- Akkadian was still the diplomatic language by this point? I'm not a historian, I could be wrong -- but I thought that their primary language was Old Persian. I was under the impression that this was one of the primary reasons that we know so little about them -- they had begun to move away from cuneiform on clay tablets, and towards Old Persian on papyrus and other mediums that decayed with time. Most of what we know from this period comes from better-preserved Greek sources, which are often quite wrong.

  
Am I mistaken? Am I missing something about the early history of Persia? Or is this some gaming short-hand that Ubisoft is using to make it make sense that so many records are there?

However, considering how Prince of Persia The Lost Crown has been a critical success while going back to the routes of the franchise, and that The Rogue Prince of Persia is coming up from a very talented team that created Dead Cells, do you think there's a chance Ubisoft might give Jordan Mechner a chance to create the real Prince of Persia 3 and finish his original trilogy?

I went into the game blind, not knowing what to expect at all. First I kind of hated it, don't really know why.

But after defeating >!Kiana!< something clicked. >!Sand Prison!< was simply good, but going through the >!time-frozen ocean!< and beating >!Orod!< was great.

The lost crown manages to keep things fresh, I really like backtracking and clearing out things that were inaccessible before.

I never thought Ubisoft would be able to produce something like this. I hope this dev team will do something similar later.

I beleive Ubisoft's reluctance to make more PoP games is that they have to pay him a portion of the profits and they'd rather just make their own IP.

I predict Ubisoft turns PoP into Assassin Creed where it's set in different settings but the gameplay remains more fantasy inspired.

1g4h1ii,ActualRedactEd,2024-10-16 04:07:04,My 2 cents on Just Dance 2025 Edition:,1,5,"Geez this game is just unreal. I cannot stress enough how messy of a game this* is overall, from the song choices, alternative songs, choreography (in general). I always love the song choices because they almost always do a fantastic job at the song list, but there were clearly a lot more songs that did NOT need to appear on just dance 2025. Why are there so many troll maps, why did we get 6 ariana grande songs that take up a big chunk of the song list, why are there more songs from ubisoft this year? Probably because of the budget is my guess, also the story/lore maps were pretty much nonexistent this year which, personally i dont have strong feelings about the lore (sorry), but I don't really find myself buying this game soon, unless it is offer at a discount somewhere like Amazon. Decent game overall, I hope I'll change my mind soon but for now, I have nothing else to say. 🤷‍♂️",https://www.reddit.com/r/JustDance/comments/1g4h1ii/my_2_cents_on_just_dance_2025_edition/,JustDance

- Limited Edition Box (cost of standard edition)

PS5:
- Digital - Deluxe and Ultimate versions (each come with more months of JD+ and cost more than the standard edition)

In there it says (translated from Dutch)

  
Ubisoft has put a strong emphasis on the social aspects of the game. The World Dance Floor is back, where you can compete in real-time against players from all over the world. This element brings fun competition, and the global leaderboard ensures that you are always encouraged to improve yourself. Moreover, integration with social media has been improved. You can easily share your dance achievements with friends, and even upload your own dance videos to show how good your moves are. For those who love streaming, there is now also a built-in Streamer Mode, which allows you to bypass copyright issues while broadcasting your sessions live.

The graphics could be like a modern day version of rock band 2's and the gameplay could have some twists from Ubisoft yet still being somewhat inspired by Guitar Hero / Rock Band.

I feel like Just Dance 2025 already has mixed reviews due to the somewhat selection of maps (unusual design choices and a lot of maps aimed for kids.)
I‘m still pretty excited for this game but if I‘m really honest, it‘s not the best game they put out for a while. I just hope the seasons throughout the game give the game a little justice. Ubisoft‘s resources also went into the Just Dance VR Game which releases on the same day (why tho?). I think this will kinda go under the radar due to Just Dance 2025 and who knows how good this VR Game sells. The song selection is not very big and it seems like it won‘t have any replayability right now. If it comes to replayability in JD25 I‘m also worried. A new prestige level with rewards would do the game some good. Last year we only got a few new quests and that was it. What about World Dance Floor?? No news at all which is so sad. 

Also I‘m tired about Ubisofts lack of transparency. The Just Dance Controller App is a fricking mess. Not right now but since the beginning of Just Dance 2023 which is INSANE. I‘m always thinking about the casual players who buy the game for their PS or Xbox and they can‘t get it running due to the constantly broken Controller App.

If they just continue to sell song pack after song pack without acknowledging the real problems, I am just very uncertain what will happen in the next years. The fact that Ubisoft's stock has crashed so much doesn't help either.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JustDance/comments/1fxleex/concerned_about_the_games_future/,JustDance

1ftfnlx,luvx1ashrr,2024-10-01 12:24:27,Leda x Traveler thoughts and theories .. ,11,5,"okay, i’m pretty sure literally all of you have seen the teaser continuing the night swan prologue .. 

as a former jacklust stan [i no longer ship the two anymore since it’s clear that they are half brothers, and i don’t support incest nor 
proship.] , i was in complete shock ,, a lil disappointed too.

BUT as the complete lore freak and theorist that i am, i like to think out of the box, dig deeper holes … think about all the plot twists that could possibly happen . 

the question that i really want a answer to is how the HELL is jack’s hair red if traveler nor leda have red hair? .. what if traveler finally decides to take that musty ass beanie off, thinking he’s dashiegames [no shame to dashie, love the guy sm] and reveals his HAIR COLOR?? what if his hair is RED ?? but that’s probably not possible due to the fact that wanderlust’s hair is black and si’ha’s hair is pink … maybe a red hair gene is roaming around in either leda’s or traveler’s family 

another possible theory i have is … leda cheated. leda could have possibly gotten knocked up by another man behind traveler’s back WHO actually has red hair ! .. but, leda decided to tell traveler that the child is his, and he believed her .

ANOTHER theory i have is … traveler has actually been living a double life . he got leda and nova PREGNANT at the same TIME ! … traveler decided to make up his mind ,, and he left to go be with nova permanently . this left leda broken , made her think she wasn’t good enough .. and this is what made her chase after perfection , this is what made her known today as night swan ! 🤯 [ngl this is actually my fav theory]

i also like to think that traveler made a promise to jack , promising he’ll come back to see him and his mother again . every day jack waited, and waited … and waited . but his father never came back .. poor jack , he deserves so much better ☹️

or maybe traveler is just like every other bum , dead beat , trash baby daddy and left for milk .. bro went 🥛🚶‍♂️💨

these are my theories and they’re most likely not possibilities … but WHO knows , just gotta wait till this game drops .. i been taking notice that ubisoft likes to slip lil plot twists into their stories lol 

i’m genuinely so excited to see what actually happens , i am in LOVE with the just dance lore , reason why i’m still a fan of 6+ years … i find it so unique for a DANCING game to have a LORE 😋 AND I LOVE GAMES WITH LORE 

i hope traveler knows he lost a good one cuz night swan / leda is … 😩 [IM SORRY]

1fob5iw,Cubriffic,2024-09-24 20:22:55,Kpop and Just Dance- What Needs to be Improved,25,10,"I know this sub is pretty mixed on kpop in JD, but as a kpop fan & with discussions about kpop routines coming up in the sub over the last few days, I wanted to do a mini-analysis on how they can improve kpop representation/routines. In the last few editions, I will admit I have found myself growing less fond of kpop routines. I still love these routines dearly, but I am less inclined to revisit them than pre-2023.

I personally think theres four main issues with kpop representation in the games, and I have some suggestions on how to fix them.

1. Lack of diversity with alternate routines.

I think a major reason kpop is disliked in JD is because they ""take up"" the alternate routine slots. And I personally agree... to an extent. It feels like kpop is not allowed to be silly in JD, which means we get boring simplified routines that reuse all the assets alongside the official choreography. I dont know whether its because theyre scared of fans disliking the routines or what, but its annoying.

Pre-2022 JD did a (mostly) great job as presenting excellent [classic kpop routines](https://youtu.be/O2mqdif7nBU?feature=shared) alongside [an extreme](https://youtu.be/ALpXr5TK7Rw?si=XbehChmR_VFDPBOH). They had similar themes but almost completely different routines, which made them more replayable. I do not play the simplified versions once Ive aced the extremes. They just kind of sit there. If they are insistent on keeping the original choreos as an extreme, they NEED to fix the middling simplified routines. Instead of just simple routines, the can create entirely new ones with themes; for example, ""Runway Version"" for Wannabe, ""Princess Version"" for Psycho, ect.

 Hell, just start giving kpop routines good hard routines that use a part of the choreo. You dont need to give all kpop routines the official choreography.


2. Missed oppotunity with quirky concepts

Kpop was known in the past for being super quirky with fun choeros and crazy concepts, and it still kind of has that reputation. However, this has been kind of ignored in JD. Other concepts are great, but quirky concepts would work super well in JD and would help diversify the kpop song list.

My personal example of a quirky kpop song that would work in JD is [Catallena](https://youtu.be/Med2XipHJJM?si=hon9qi3fQdjAdjUi) by Orange Caramel. The choreo is relatively simple and the fish/sushi concept fits right into JD! Another example from a smaller group is Saturday's [D.B.D.B.DIB](https://youtu.be/yXZCzFvs1tw?si=vKX7dOo6s4jBe40X). Although its from a smaller group, the song is quintissential quirky kpop and its a good example of how quirky concept can fit into JD.


3. Lack of older kpop songs

JD is terrified of any kpop song made before 2018, and specifically songs made by the second generation. Its so frustrating. Boombayah was the last pre-2018 song used, and it was still by a third-generation group. While I understand the games want to use songs that came out recently, it does a disservice to the iconic kpop songs of previous generations.

Wheres [Ring Ding Dong](https://youtu.be/roughtzsCDI?si=pyOBhvtPSpNWEHpc)? Or [Into The New World](https://youtu.be/0k2Zzkw_-0I?si=bPac2wmv0NznMyyb)? Or [Good Day](https://youtu.be/jeqdYqsrsA0?si=RtXv7uVQ2wlBRlKp)? These songs are very iconic and would help bring the spotlight onto some older songs, and again would diversify the kpop representation. Hell, if you want to keep a group like BTS, why not use one of their old songs like [War of Hormone](https://youtu.be/XQmpVHUi-0A?si=_Tjb16fqnoxAtPi-) or [Dope](https://youtu.be/BVwAVbKYYeM?si=910yPOTLlzxeL1cy) (especially if theyre gonna give them multiple songs in one game)?

4. Reusing assets

I quickly brushed over this in the first point but the JD team reusing assets is VERY frustrating and adds to the feeling of all kpop routines being similar. This is especially a problem with the BTS routines; I get its kind of cool that all their songs have the same coaches, but I really want some diversity in characters. It gets boring when every BTS song has the same characters. They really need to mix up the assets a bit.

NOW- None of my above criticisms were meant to put down the songs in the newer games. They are all still excellent songs. However, you can see that JD is still not doing a great job with their choice of kpop songs. Overall, kpop has okay representation in JD, but its being done a disservice by Ubisoft. If they want to keep kpop around in the songlists, they should use it as an oppotunity to introduce the JD audience to both old and new kpop songs with fleshed out and well-themed routines, instead of making a simple routine with the same assets and calling it a day.

Worked flawlessly. I am so excited to dance to songs I have missed and will make another post regarding it.


1) Songs no longer available:
Imaging practicing a song everyday and one day it's no longer there.

There are many reason but the main one being removal of good songs. I don't care about most of the songs there but the good songs, they just keep removing. I missed those songs so much that I just danced to a youtube video of that song, and I loved it. Since people don't actually dance with you live and the things Ubisoft has done with this game, I feel no reason to continue anymore.

I am going to download these videos to my own system and keep with me and just dance to them instead from now on. Also the current songs I am going to screen record if they are not available online. The last thing I want is the songs I am mastering removed without any 

Songs I missed:
Airplanes, Gangnam Style, Senorita, Gentleman, Teenage Dream, Happy and many many more.

2) Bugs that break:
a) Any sort of alarm or call triggers a double audio on the system the song is being played.
b) There is no screen lock feature and songs like Happy & Blue require you to clap and it can many times just close on it's own. The new confirmation feature is better but still it has issues. It simply needs a slider to work.
c) Can't remove songs from favorite. Every morning I remove the songs Teacher(Alternate) and many other and the next day it comes back again.
d) Your score depends on close to the router you are. There is no lag-delay check in the app. It's a simple thing, just ask the person to do a few motions at the start of the sesssion and the delay can be calculated. I started using the laptop's hotspot(closer) and my scores immediately improved.
e) 

3) Lies:
a) The online dance together feature is just wrong. It's just pre-recorded sesssions of other people. Earlier I thought these are people who are live then kept wondering why aren't they leaving if the song hasn't started yet.
b) Many songs which you expect would be something good turn out to be a cheap copy. What song comes to your head when you hear Criminal, Fancy or Down? Now go check in the app what these songs are and you will get my point.

4) Songs never added:
While looking on the internet for songs I missed I realized there are many songs that were never added to this live subscription model and I am pissed knowing these songs were held.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JustDance/comments/1fl7cm8/after_using_just_dance_now_for_two_years_now_i/,JustDance

Playing JD 2022 with Unlimited was my go to for exercise. I live in a dangerous area (US, of course) and can’t get out much. I also used to dance before covid and college so JD has been very important in my day-to-day. 

It may be dramatic to say that I am devastated that Unlimited is no more. I very much dislike the format of the recent JD games, and am frustrated that only a few songs are offered on JD+, it’s just incomparable.

What do I do? Go back and buy all the other games available to the switch to access more songs? Is JD+ worth it at all? Who do I write at Ubisoft to voice my concerns? I played every single day for hours. It helped me exercise during a depression when I never wanted to leave the bed. Now i’m playing a dance on one JD, then bouncing to another JD and another. 

I am so bummed it makes me not even want to play anymore…

1f9atql,Turbulent-Fly-7747,2024-09-05 09:47:49,"Predictions for Rasputin and The Bride in ""Payphone""",21,6,"Well; this just dropped. After seeing the teaser... I think majority of us want to see them come back together. Heres my thoughts and predictions for what the dance could be and the story. (If you have any ideas for this song put them in the comments)

I feel like during the first two verses we'll see one side be in the regular/original outfits and the other be in the new punked up outfit. (Which one first I have no idea) However during the chorus these are probably just some flashbacks or visions of the two being a happier couple. ""If happy ever afters did exist"" During the third verse or bridge I feel like it would be a phone call or communication between the two finally trying to fix all of this. (based off the thumbnail) And finally they do the last main chorus dance but now in they're new outfits; finally a bride and groom dancing. And at the end... some like touching emotional moment like a crying hug from the bride or something else. (We see in the thumbnail background its brighter with lights and stars and not a wreck like ""Sweet but psycho"")

Now for the story/lore. I'm obviously wanting a happy resolution, but who knows. When it comes to the lyrics it's negative but definitely has some information. With the trashed up bachelor party background rasputin has and the lyrics ""You say it's too late to make it, But is it too late to try?"" This generally confirms that Rasputin was probably late for the wedding... as in he was hungover probs.  
Now... a small thought I had was just based off the name of the song ""Payphone"" I know we have a general assumption on Rasputin's excuse, but I wonder if their is any connection to the lore in ""Telephone"". I remember in littleshia/avery's lore vid on the coaches love story there was a theory with Rasputin. Just wanted to throw that in there just because (And did I mention the thumbnail enough times?)

Edit: After rewatching the ""I am my own Muse"" lore vid from Littleshia she mentioned an unexpected events. This was probably the bachelor party that another coach maybe set up for him.

Overall hope this song goes well; by that I mean the dance and the story arc. (But can I say that these songs in the trilogy and the dances themselves are one the better ones in there games) I really loved these characters from the original games and wonder if this is the end of their story... well if they had a kid like Shia Nova and the traveller-Anyways! I don't really do this kind of thing, but these two are an exception and hopefully you enjoyed my rant/thoughts. Thank you!

I used to just watch the videos on YouTube so I’ve dedicated to try out for the first time and buy one of the games. At the moment it’s cheapest to buy the 2024 edition on the switch, the ultimate edition is so expensive and I’m not sure what the difference between them is. I came across JDN and I can’t find much on this sub regarding it. I installed it on my iPhone, tried playing it on the web browser - it’s OK but doesn’t feel as good as the console versions. It looks so cheap looking compared to the actual games, so I assumed it’s a fake copy but turns out it’s owned by Ubisoft too. Anyway, back to the question.

The interface is terrible, it runs like trash on the Switch. Every time I get a new Just Dance game, I never like it at first and then it ends up growing on me and I HOPE this is the case with 2024. The song list is pretty good, lots of songs that I like no real opinion there.

My biggest problem with the game is how it refuses to be simple. Just Dance is a game that thrives on simplicity and it's trying to do so much more than it needs to. The choreography seems way too busy for some of these songs, it's too much and it doesn't fit with the songs. I can appreciate some of the videos when it adds to the dance, but too often it ends up being distracting. I play Just Dance because I like to dance, I don't need a full storyline or distracting visuals.

17yfyjy,Disastrous-Guest4917,2023-11-19 05:02:48,A love letter to STEEP,31,10,"I'm not sure how long this post will stay up due to the rules of this subreddit. Regardless I wanted my opinion to be known on the game as I have a deep connection to it. As I lack editing skills and recording software to upload a video to Youtube, I figured I'd do the next best thing and come to a place with like minded individuals to see if ya'll feel the way I do about the game.  


STEEP found me at a low point in my early teen years around the ages of 12-13. Ever since then I've grown a passion for the game and the outdoors in general, it made me put down the controller and leave my house in search for adventures of my own. The game with its glistening white peaks and graphics that still hold up these many years later kept me coming back. Unfortunately I've lost the game due to me giving it away to a friend of mine who didn't have many games at the time. Yet I still have vivid memories of climbing a mountain solo listening to the heavenly soundtrack that was put together by the team over at Ubisoft. Only to slide down on a snowboard with a gorgeous sky and a bright sun in my eyes. The game now gives me a sense of melancholy as I look back on what got me through so many tough times and legitimately changed my life. Most of the friends I've made on playstation we're because of STEEP. Roleplaying together and having a blast on a summer night. Sometimes we wouldn't mutter a word and we would just know to follow one another as we glided through the powdery snow. I am humbled to be able to call these people I've met my friends still as we play other games now but nothing will ever be like STEEP. The laughs, the quiet nights, the roleplays we all had were amazing and the memories made are sure to stick with me forever. Occasionally whilst playing alone I didn't find myself doing missions or quests rather just exploring...Eventually snowboarding through the wispy pines only to come into a clearing back lit by a red sunset with a melonic tone playing in the background as I take in the beautiful sight. I really wish I could revisit those lonely peaks and relearn their stories as I reflect on a time in my life that was filled with so much fun yet anxiety in my real life.   


Now because of what STEEP has done to shape me I find myself going out mainly in the winter to the woods for days on end and hiking at every opportunity I get. Because of the game, my recent adventures, and the fondness I have for the wild. I find myself growing an attachment to pine forests and wither it be rain, shine , or snow hardly anything can keep me from setting out on more adventure. Its to such a point where I wish to travel out to the pacific northwest and lose myself amongst trees that hold stories as old as man. And I owe it all to STEEP and the friends I've made along the way...So thank you for reading and thank you Ubisoft for inspiring a change in my life. Thank you STEEP and the team that made it for being the catalyst to what my life has become. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steep/comments/17yfyjy/a_love_letter_to_steep/,Steep

1ea5y1t,Kahvana,2024-07-23 19:55:12,Anno 1602 on linux,12,0,"Hi everyone!

I managed to get both the GOG version and History edition to launch and play on linux.
While it's possible to run the History edition, I highly recommend the GOG edition instead despite the complexity in setup.

## Environment

For this guide, I assume you're using flatpak (it makes setup significantly easier!).
I tested everything under Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

### Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

If you need to setup flatpak, I suggest running this in your Terminal:

```sh
# only install flatpak
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends flatpak

# add flathub (https://flathub.org) apps list
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

# update available apps index to include flathub apps
flatpak update --appstream

# (optional) add gnome software so you can download and install .flatpakref files
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends gnome-software gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
```

## Anno 1602 A.D. (GOG)

- Recommended
- Works as expected
- Has working multiplayer (over TCP)

### Notes

- If you want to run multiple instances of the game at the same time, you must duplicate the bottle we create in the installation.

### Installation

1. Install Bottles [link](https://flathub.org/apps/com.usebottles.bottles)
2. Create a new bottle > custom > use defaults (I named the bottle `anno1602`)
3. In bottle settings, change Windows Version to Windows XP
4. Press the 3 dots at the right-top corner of the bottle, select `Browse files...`
5. Copy-paste the GOG installer into the `drive_c` directory
6. In bottle, click `Run Executable...` and select the GOG installer
7. Proceed as normal (I installed the game in `drive_c/Games/Anno 1602`) and wait for the installer to finish
8. In bottle dependencies, add `directmusic` and `directplay`
9. In bottle, launch `Config` and set resolution to `1024x768`, press ""Ok""

In some versions of the installer, `Config` is not registered automatically. You can manually register it yourself:

- In bottle, click add shortcut... go to the location of your `1602.exe` (mine's in `/home/user/.var/app/come.usebottles.bottles/data/bottles/bottles/anno1602/drive_c/Games/Anno 1602/`) and select `Config.exe`. (you might need to enable hidden folder preview in your file manager)

### Starting the game

1. Open the `anno1602` bottle
2. Launch `1602`
3. Enjoy!

### Make the game run windowed

- In bottle settings, change Advanced display settings > enable virtual desktop, 1024x768

## Anno 1602 History Edition (Steam)

- Singleplayer works as expected
- Cannot access multiplayer / settings by default, you must fix the purple menu issue
- Has working multiplayer (over steam) but might CTD

### Notes

- I assume you installed steam from flathub
- I assume you bought the game from steam
- You can't access the settings or multiplayer without fixing the purple screen issue.

### Installation

1. Install the game as normal through steam

#### Fixing purple menu issue

1. Install protontricks [link](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.Matoking.protontricks)
2. Launch protontricks, select anno 1602 - history edition
3. Select ""Select the default wineprefix""
4. Select ""Install a Windows DLL or component""
5. Select `d3dcompiler_47` and apply

### Starting the game

1. Start the game from steam,
2. Enjoy!

#### If ""Steam is not responding"" shows up

1. Open `gnome-system-monitor` (ubuntu) or `ksysguard` (steam deck)
2. Select `Anno1602.exe` (anno 1602), kill it
3. The game will relaunch itself

### Closing the game

1. Close the game
2. Open `gnome-system-monitor` (ubuntu) or `ksysguard` (steam deck)
3. Select `Anno1602.exe` (anno 1602), kill it
4. Select `upc.exe` (ubisoft launcher), kill it

## Post changelog

- 2024/10/15 14:04 > got the game to finally start normally using steam

1e9cr7l,EtherealEtiquette,2024-07-22 20:13:20,Console Save Issues ,2,6,"I've noticed a couple of threads about Anno 1800 having save issues on both PC and Console. I ran into the same thing last night and thought I'd share what I found as the game is now on Playstation Extra/Premium and others are going to eventually run into this problem if they sink a lot of time into the game. After playing for 320hrs (bug aside it's a really good game) I noticed my recent save would say it was saved over an hour ago when really it was only a couple of minutes, this was the same for both manual and quicksave. Upon trying to load that save or any any save from that playthrough I'd be met with a blank UI. My first thought was that it was just one recent corrupted save file and I could roll back to a previous file, that wasn't the case.

What seems to be happening is that the game is continuously stacking autosaves until it reaches a hard limit, after that it won't save again. The obvious solution would be delete some previous saves but it's worse than it sounds. The game doesn't allow you to view or access all of those autosaves, it only displays the last few recent saves and manually saving won't make a difference either.

Here's how it must have gone unchecked. The saves on PS5 are going to one bulk save file, that file won't display those individual save files. Again it gets worse. I tested this next part on three different playthroughs and it wiped all of them. No matter what playthrough you start or continue the game won't just refuse to save, it will lock you out of that playthrough, that's when the profile for that playthrough vanishes from the in-game load menu.

The only workaround for any of this would be to wipe the original bulk save file, set the highest autosave interval to one hour then every fifty or so minutes make a manual save before it can autosave, jump back to the title screen and then load that previous manual save. Two adjustments would have prevented this issue, allow the player to disable autosave, allow the player to view every save file in the menu not just the last few. I don't know that the average player is going to sink enough time to run into this problem, I really enjoyed my time with the game but this is a major issue that will ruin every playthrough on the system. I'll probably keep it installed and do the fifty of so minute manual save trick I mentioned, I can't see Ubisoft ever addressing the problem.

*TL;DR Anno 1800 is stacking inaccessible autosaves on PS5 that will eventually hit a hard limit and lock you out of your playthroughs, even previous playthroughs as when you load into them you will be met with 'saved over an hour ago' and further interacting with the save feature will cause the playthrough to vanish and become completely inaccessible.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1e9cr7l/console_save_issues/,anno

1e29q36,rveij,2024-07-13 20:52:54,"Anno Ancient: a massive, 50-slide game concept",122,14,"Hi all!

Now that Anno 117 has been announced, I'd like to share Anno Ancient, a fan concept I've worked on occasionally over the course of several years. It describes, in detail, a potential Anno game set around Ancient Greece and Egypt, and has been a real labour of love with dozens of hours of both historical and game research going into it. I've played Anno since 1602 and was one of the main administrators of the Anno 2070 Wiki back in its day, and this document is the culmination of almost all my experiences with and thoughts of the series so far.

It's not finished and I don't intend to finish it - both because the scope of the ambition has been a little mad but also because with the announcement of 117, while plenty different from my concept, essentially fulfils my long-standing wish of an Anno game in this era.

The entire document can be viewed at [AnnoAncient.pdf](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AggHM_lQQVTMtdh3ubxQEJ-ayBgSpg?e=UnG4EA) (might take a second to load) and it's published under CC0 1.0 Universal, essentially relinquishing my copyright on it, to allow anyone to do with it what they want and to prevent any unfortunate cases just in case a feature in a future game seems similar to one in here by coincidence.

To be clear - I'm not publishing this to set any kind of expectation, or even to tell Ubisoft what I think should be in Anno 117 (or any future game). There's plenty in here that's either unrealistic or just tuned to what I personally would want with little consideration for other people or play styles. I'm publishing this because I (half-)made something that I'm proud of, that's it, and I hope you enjoy it for what it is.

That said, while it's nowhere near finished, the document does include:

* Production chains worked out for 14 population levels across several regions
* Detailed descriptions of new mechanisms such as legitimacy and a technology tree
* 20+ ship types with approximate statistics
* 21 NPCs with personality and gameplay details

...amongst plenty of other random ideas!

Here are some screenshots, to give you a taste of the level of detail:

[https://youtu.be/mMBOrKH-BHI?si=bUKTRxgfkOdm8YKB](https://youtu.be/mMBOrKH-BHI?si=bUKTRxgfkOdm8YKB)

The first first few minutes are about the trailer, so nothing very interesting here. There was Fabiano, Geraldine and Heiko talking live, and occasionally they showed clips from an interview they did with Manuel, Creative Director of Anno 117.

# Setting and Rebrand

* Gamestar has some ""exclusive info"" they say.
* The game is set during pax romana like the title suggests

Fabiano :

* Second session ""Albion"", the celtic, north european region. As in the trailer shows the herald in latium and albion, a swampy region.
* The roman empire reached its largest extent ever in the year 117.
* Rome extended to pretty wild regions like britain, where no roman wants to be, like the devs said.

O-Tone of interview with Anno CD shown:

* We wanted to bring 2 sessions from the start, many systems in the game build on this
* We want to tell a slightly different story about rome, a very large empire of extremes, and we want to create stories and images that aren't there on the market yet.
* Researched Egypt as potential second session first, but settled on Albion, because it creates a big rift and contrast to the roman region.
* The celtic world seemed one of the most exciting settings to Mainz. It's about the suprise.

Heiko talking about the setting:

* I expected the setting and thinks its the most logical step for the brand.
* Wasn't sure because the opportunity of Anno 9 literally being called Anno 9
* Of what was in the roman era, pax romana made most sense as a setting.
* The reset is pretty much mandatory, because you are coming from the anno 1800 monster with 4 seasons.
* The setting avoids that 1800 content is compared to 117 because of historically being close to it.
* It's the second Anno that is presented at a Ubi Forward, after 2205 being the first (at E3).

Geraldine:

* Apparently the Mainz Studio wants to go international
* This Anno is the first to have a subtitle, which is unusual for german games
* The game is not a spin-off, which GameStar was a little unsure about and asked
* The Mainz Studio has decided on the subtitle because 117 wasn't clear enaugh of a number to be interpreted as a year, especially for people who don't know the series.
* There is a new Logo for Anno 117, a very stylized A, which stands for the rebrand. During the presentation, the Anno Brand Manager (Haye) told the Gamestar that the stylized A will represent Anno for at least the next 10 years.

Fabiano :

* I was very sceptical of the rebrand
* Ubisoft wants to focus content for the international community, which is why the rebrand makes a bit of sense.

Heiko:

* Anno 117 only comes 6 years after 1800, which is the longest for the series.
* This is due to games-as-a-service

Fabiano :

* The logo was intended to fit the roman epoch
* The logo alludes to roman craftsmanship
* Does the new logo mean that they want to stay in the antique era for the next 10 years?

Geraldine:

* Maybe, we are interpreting to much into it..

Heiko:

* Doesn't think that the game will be intended for 10 years

# Biggest Change: Sessions

Heiko:

* The most exciting thing was that you can pick your start provice. Until this game, you had a large and multiple smaller sessions. Now, you can start where you want. This has many repercussions for gameplay.

Manuel (Anno CD):

* We know that complexity, as much as many players want and like it - we internally talk about the biggest anno - is a problem for many player. You gotta go to the next island, the next session. You gotta process, keep being active.
* This point is something we will adress. For example, you can pick starting session, Albion or Latium.
* You'll be able to build an empire, but the decision can be made earlier, you can access content earlier.
* If you want everything, you can still have everything.
* We want to give options, so players can search for their difficulty.
* It's about making things modular and opening up linearity.
* We know that for many players multi-session or multi-biome (!!) is something very cool. This complexity will still be there in Anno 117

Fabiano :

* It's pretty exciting, in theory, you're not forced to go to another session
* So, the classic anno fashion is: You need products from the new world, from orient.
* But now, to adress a bigger audience, to not scare players with forced complexity, you can choose, where you want to be and whether you wanna stay.
* Well, it has been a signal of quality of the series so far that complexity always happened organically.
* I think the community might be sceptical.

Geraldine:

* This was a point you asked multiple times just to be sure, because it seemed curious to you.
* Since there have been multiple session things to anno, the deal was that you are more or less forced to go there.

Fabiano :

* In theory, in 1404 the orient was kinda the same as a session

Heiko:

* It's a bit disappointing, because you could have just had Rome and the entire mediterranian sea on a huge map
* My dream antique anno would have been where you played multiple different factions/people, that would have been pretty demanding, especially in multiplayer
* I am interested, because they didn't tell, whether you play the same people in Albion and Latium, or whether it will be two.
* In my point of view, the trailer teasers that you will have different style of gameplay, because you just don't do things in a swamp that well.
* You might need to make the swamps habitable, or urbanize them

Geraldine:

* In Land of Lions, there also was a little urbinization

Fabiano :

* I have my thoughts about the different cultures. If you read between the lines in the interview, we might be up to something with the different cultures.
* Ubisoft told us: A reason why the epoch of pax romana is diverse is because there were many different cultures in the Imperium Romanum. And that was a adminstrative challenge.

Manuel (Anno CD):

* ... It's a mediterranian empire. People from 3 continents, 20% of world population. We asked ourselves: How was it, keeping the empire stable. How did people work together with their different cultures and backgrounds.
* We found it to be a very interesting angle to approach the topic from.
* Rome is always shown as this italy-thing, focused on military fantasy, but it was an empire that was stable for 200 years. How did they even do this?

Fabiano :

* The romans didn't say ""We took Gallia, now we will replace every governor with our own"", they didn't do that. They recruited the local head of town and made them loyal to them.
* They appropriated the culture of the local people, and over years, legions and administration, they let the provinces adapt to rome
* They weren't invasive, other than invading at first.
* The devs found diplomacy and politics very interesting, and I guess this will be a very important aspect. There will be a difference between having a town in Albion, or in Latium.
* very sure that because the roman empire had all those different regions, we might see Egypt, Greece and such in the future.

Heiko:

* Disregarding implementation, many different factions were also in 1503: Well, they were played by AI, but it shows that other factions always have been integral to the series.
* I hope that it goes into the direction of Orient (1404) and Land of Lions
* Just by game mechanics, I don't believe that it will make a big difference, as Anno is very sandboxy.
* I find more interesting how the choice of starting session will influence the peacefulness of the game experience. Because Inner rome was peaceful, but in the north, it was down to business, with the gauls, on the limes, and I am interested whether they will implement that.

Geraldine:

* I'd say, with two start sessions, we will have different cultures, very similar to anno 1800.
* The reason why that is interesting: Either they will be entirely seperated, if the Creative Director says you can choose, and you don't have to play both, and make up your own difficulty level
* This is getting closer to the community, but also it's about expanding the community. Many would have said with 1800, that they want even more sessions, but others wouldn't, and the discussion was very big.
* We asked them: Can we expect more sessions? They didn't give confirmation, but it seemed that they are expecting it themselves.

Heiko:

* They would be dumb to not do that. With that concept they held 1800 up for so long.
* 1800 is permanently in the ten most-searched games on the GameStar site, since release. I have never experienced that before.
* What I wonder is, regarding choice of starting province: How to do a campaign? You can't integrate it into continuous game, because you don't know where the player starts.
* The option would be to have two campaigns, one per session, that's my assumption
* Variant 2 would be a seperated campaign like 2070/1404/1701

Geraldine:

* I think they will still expect most people to go to both sessions.
* Probably it isn't that complicated
* Ubisoft said that story is an integral part of the identity.

Heiko:

* Session-specific stories like Land of Lions are very well a possibility
* But then, there would need to be different game mechanic
* Starting from zero two times in the same game would be dumb

# Seasons and DLC

Fabiano :

* The thought of not requiring leaving the session would even open up for more sessions to come.
* Because it can be very fun to not have all sessions all the time. You can start.
* For example, if there was an Egypt DLC, you could just play it in a new game.
* And Ubisoft might say: If you think your Anno is getting too big, just skip other sessions in a new game.
* In principle, you can extend that anno endlessly.
* The bad thing would be that you cannot interconnect that much.

Geraldine:

* If Fans discuss about this, it's gonna be people who want the entire experience.
* That concept can go wrong or right, but it's not only the factor of being open to newcomers. It's an admission that they want to add more sessions. What was criticized most about 1800 was not the amount, but it was hard to get everything put together if you got so many options. In your world, you had to reach a goal, a DLC was unlocked, you do an expedition to the new map, and then do a small campaign. What often happens is that you arrive to a new session late, and the AI already has everything, and you are arriving at the wrong time. It's not easy to get the sweetspot right.
* If they manage to solve this with autarc sessions, try it out with two at first, and then extend to 3 or 4, this might be a very good thing.

Fabiano :

* My worry is that the game is by ubisoft, and they are very eager to make things optional to open the game for many people.
* If complexity is optional, this can go wrong really quick. The Settlers is a prime example, because they made production chains like food optional. That makes playing worthless.
* If cool, interconnected production chains are made optional, this could go wrong really quick, that's my worry.

Heiko:

* I don't share that worry, they will keep to the Anno Union principle of community development, which worked very well.
* They stated that they won't dumb down 117, but we cannot have the same amount of complexity at release as 1800 has after 5 years.
* A big, unsung strength of Anno is the amount of configuration you can do on game start. That alone will adress many things. Don't want AI, you can turn it off.
* They will have a 4-5 years plan of post-launch, that won't work if everything is dumbed down, because you gotta get more out of game mechanics.

Geraldine:

* We'll get back to that in a minute. Of course, we asked Ubisoft about Seasons. It's something they think about, but not right now, and they don't make those plans right now, that's for later.

Manuel (Anno CD)

* We think Seasons worked well for 1800, it was very fair, it worked for fans and developers
* What and how, it's too early for that.

Geraldine:

* Coming back to the community driven development. We will experience 117 in a testing phase. They will try to slowly get there. See 1800, it got like 20 game updates with free content.
* They will now, with all the knowledge gained from 1800, they will go into that testing phase. They will make most of the decisions based on community feedback, especially in post-launch. This will probably decide how many seasons there will be.
* In my last interview for 1800, we talked about how the last 4 seasons worked, and deduct things for another anno. They put out a season, watched the reaction and only then decided whether to make the next one.

Heiko:

* Don't forget that 1800 was a huge package at release already, and it seems this is also the plan for 117.

# Multiplatform

Heiko:

* Another first for the game: The game will be multi-platform at start.
* That will definitly bring some worries to traditionalists

Fabiano :

* I asked the devs, for me it's important how they see and develop 1800 with console version being around.
* I have my negative experiences with it, I have seen how game series developed when console was in focus and the PC perspective just didn't feel right.
* But I think it's good that they made the console version of 1800 first to see how it works on consoles.
* It showed, the game can work on console. The devs have seen the same details in the statistics, and it isn't played very differently.
* Now they are developing 117 from the start as a dual-platform game. They know that their core community is on PC, they know that things have to be top on that platform. They said that it can't be that the console version drags down the console version.
* But Console will influence questions like how to design the UI?
* I was pretty soothed after I heard their answers, and I have my hopes up for this to turn out well.

Geraldine:

* Just to say it, the only critique with the console version was missing DLC. This would have been much effort, and they probably said that they can't invest the time to do that.
* I think very much that this will not be the case with 117 and all DLC will also launch on console.

Heiko:

* I think they confirmed it by saying that this game is a parallel development for both platform.
* With 1800 it was a testbed after-the-fact.

Geraldine:

* One of the most polarising questions was on changing the chessboard-rasterized tiles, whether to change or keep them.
* Personally, I get the critique, especially for the visuals, but it's such an integral part of brand identity if you'd remove it. An Anno without tiles would not be an anno.
* The reason I say that is because playing tetris is a part of the game, finding layouts.
* Anno is not a city-builder, but a citybuilding puzzle.
* Everything is about tiles. Public buildings satisfy by tile range for example. Removing that, everything will change.
* In the presentation, they talked about the logo and it's symmetry being a nod to the raster. Now for the curious: I asked about whether there will be a reform, and they said that they right now can't say anything.
* So, theory, there will be a raster, but maybe there will be reform

Heiko:

* It's hard to imagine Anno without the raster.
* I laughed because they have picked the perfect setting for a raster, because the romans have planned their cities that way.
* I can imagine, but that's speculation, there might be a split between roman cities and other cities, that there will be different ways of building things and cities will look differently.
* Maybe, in the villages, there will be more organic streets.

Fabiano :

* In celtic settlements, they might use visual design to hide the rasterization a little, so the buildings connect to pathways better.

Geraldine:

* I made a list with theories even:
   1. It's a visual thing only. The mechanic is a raster, but the visuals hide it, like Fabiano  said.
   2. Often wished variant, even done with mods: 45 degree angles. We know from the mods that it is possible.
   3. Also a mod, and it was in the Pharao game: Having buildings be modular and connect to each other. There is a mod for 1800 that does that for factories, if you build three of them, they snap together to be a factory complex.
   4. Nonrectangular buildings would be a variant

# Beauty-Building

Heiko:

* If you were ever in doubt who is the biggest beauty-builder, here you got the answer.
* Of course there will be cosmetic DLCs. That's such a quick buck for Ubisoft.

Geraldine:

* We asked ourselves whether there will be naked roman statues, or if they will need to hide it somehow.

Heiko:

* They didn't have problems with that in AC Odyssey

Fabiano :

* Speaking of statues, they had the purpose of showing people who the emperor governing them is.
* I want statues and temples.
* Sadly, I didn't manage to ask them about religion, because that is very integral.
* Building pantheons and temples was pretty important
* Oh and I want the Colosseum and Circus Maximus.

Geraldine:

* We had limited time and were prioritizing questions during our Interview, and the monument question was low-prio. Of course there will be some.
* We know from 1800 that they get inspired by reallife monuments and just rebrand them a little.

Heiko:

* Regarding monuments, I have the open question of whether they might go back to 2205. No monumental builds, but big builds at predefined places.
* That would fit with hadrians wall or limes very well
* You could build it successively

Fabiano :

* In the scenarios of 1800, there were monuments like the dam on the eco-island, so they did it there too.

# The biggest competitor: Anno 1800.

Geraldine:

* Let's go towards a conclusion.
* We had asked them: How do you handle rebeginning after 1800. That's the gold standard now. Creating a new game is a step backwards. Let's show the interview clip

Manuel (Anno CD)

* There will be areas where we just cannot reach 1800 with 117 at launch, like scope. We must accept that.
* But we tried to analyze 1800, what worked, what didn't. We took that as reference to change and improve things. Not only for players, but also how we handle the game.
* Anno 1800 is a monster, and 117 will be smaller at launch. We just have to approach it with the promise of eventually reaching something grand, and we want to have something very good at launch.

Geraldine:

* We already said it, it's gonna come out in 2025.
* They were in main production for a year now.
* The concept phase was very very old. Fun fact, the idea has been around for like 11 years. There was an image leak 11 years ago from a dev meeting, where you had an Anno 117.

Heiko:

* That doesn't mean anything. They might have like ten potential settings lying around. We also know that after 1701, 1800 was initially supposed to be the successor. But the timeframe was too close for them.
* Mainz works very well with focusgroup tests. They ask people like me what we'd find interesting.
* They have many options, and now there was the ideal time to go to the antique era.

Fabiano :

* And it was a big wish of the community as well.
* For this, they had 6 settings in closer consideration, but eventually went with this.
* Lately we had news on the gamestar, someone wrote about Anno 180 because of a typo. And a reader wrote about being excited about an antique anno for a moment in the comments only to be disappointed - And now it's coming.

Geraldine:

* Asia was a big wish for 1800 as well, and people wanted that as the next session - and when that didn't came, they wanted it to be the next anno.
* I'd pay 5 bucks to find out what the other settings were.
* Martin wrote about potential settings a few months ago which even included 1305

Heiko:

* That was a nice gag when they made fun of all the journalists on the 2070 reveal, you saw an Anno plank with 1305 on the monitor. And then the camera zoomed out and it was a holographic video screen in Anno 2070.

Geraldine:

* 1305 is also in the credits of 1800, just to make us angry.
* We are at a moment where we didn't see any gameplay.
* But after 1800, we have some basic trust into the studio, because we know the community driven strategy works
* We'll do more talks and hopefully get them for interviews again.

Heiko:

* If the game is coming out next year, chances will be that they'll show gameplay on Gamescom.

Geraldine:

* Let's see we didn't forget something

# Combat

Fabiano :

* We left out that fighting and combat topic, because they didn't say anything about it.
* The only hint on a combat system was where we asked what game pillars of Anno are
* They answered: The mix of different elements, in part ""grand strategy"" with all the AI players.
* In the interview, they said that you can either get along diplomatically, or it will come to skirmishes. And that sounded like it's an aspect they will have it.
* Just sea battles would be pretty boring, even more so than in 1800.
* But we'll see some military stuff I guess, as that was so important in ancient rome, who controlled the army had power.

Heiko:

* You cannot go into the age of Asterix without romans fighting each other.

Geraldine:

* People who talked to me at least once: I ain't a fan of fighting in Anno. Sadly 1800 has its weaknesses in that regard, but I don't care, I want my christmas market.
* However, it would have been nice if they improved that.

Fabiano :

* A challenge of games in ancient times is plentiness of goods. You don't have things like Scooters there.
* Interesting production chains would be weapons: Shields, swords, javelins. It would be wasted if we couldn't produce something like that.

Heiko:

* I was suprised when hearing Grand Strategy being announced that prominently.
* The game was grand strategy, but the military was pretty small.
* I hope they will do a similar system like 1404 with global-tactic decisions, where you find with legions, not individual units. Would be fitting for the setting.

# Production chains

Geraldine:

* Because you said production chains: I asked them about a hint for a production chains..

Fabiano : ... And they disconnected.

Geraldine:

* They were talking to us from LA, and everything was fine, but the second I asked that, the screen froze, and I thought I asked the forbidden question.
* Well, they were back after a minute.
* But they only gave a hint, a production chain was hiding in the colors of the presentation.

Fabiano :

* Our assumption: Purpur, that was the most valuable color of ancient times.
* You need to fish for the snails first, that would be super fitting.

Geraldine:

* That fits what you do in 1800 and before, with the coastal buildings, so a snail fishery it will be probably.

Fabiano :

* They told about three goods. First, purpur is our interpretation, but they also namedropped two examples during the interview when talking about resource shortages:
* Stuff like Terracotta and limestone.
* Speculation, but that wasn't by accident, that they thought of those two goods.

# Conclusion and Wishes

Heiko:

* I want a good story campaign that includes all game elements and doesn't stop after tier 3 of 5. #salty

Fabiano :

* Anno virtues: I want interconnection, new resources in different sessions, many resources. I want cool production chains, cool trade. And I am interested in whether they will keep their promise of showing ingame how the Roman empire was administrated.

Geraldine:

* Christmas market ornaments.
* Well, I wish to get many ornaments again.

1ddaak0,papabuno,2024-06-11 17:52:34,Anno 117: Choosing your starting province,12,4,"I'm immensely excited for a Roman Anno game!! In the Ubisoft Forward livestream I noticed something that I haven't seen anyone talk about yet:

""For the first time in Anno, you will be able to choose your starting province. Either the mysterious Celtic wetlands of Albion where no civilised Roman wants to be. Or, the traditional Roman heartlands, Latium, close to the hungry heart of the empire"" (1:10:10 in the livestream)

I think this is very interesting and I am wondering how it will impact game progression. 

What are everyone's thoughts on this?

1ddbn0z,mindkiller317,2024-06-11 19:18:11,Here's why 117 is a PERFECT year for a Roman Anno.,502,97,"Salve amici! My area of expertise is in late republic and Augustan Rome, but I wanted to do a little digging on 117 and see what was shaking then.

I had always hoped they saved Rome for Anno 9, but much to my delight, I discovered that 117 is actually the perfect year for a Roman Anno game.

* Trajan died, and **Hadrian ascended to the imperial throne.** He's a well known emperor, considered one of the better ones. He was a micromanager, very hands on, and visited every Roman province. I think it's safe to say he would have *loved* Anno. I doubt we will play as or meet Hadrian since Anno fictionalizes its historic characters, but we will no doubt feel his presence in the narrative.

* **The Roman Empire reached its geographic peak in 117.** This cannot be a coincidence. The devs must have been checking up on all =9 years when this fact smacked them in the face. The potential list of DLC provinces is [absolutely insane](https://preview.redd.it/gyx9a9236tb81.png?width=1024&auto=webp&s=b31e61fb7c7893b3d888911c372ab40fe407c822). It blows my mind how much they could fit in this game if they want to. Ubisoft, for once, I'll allow all the microtransactions and DLC that you want to shove in there. Egypt, Spain, Mesopotamia, Germany, the Caucuses... it's all there ripe for the DLCing. 

* **Hadrian's Wall.** This is clearly a big influence on why we are starting with Britannia as the first province as it fits the timeline perfectly. This wall was the northern border of the empire, begun in 122. I'll bet a ship full of coffee and rubber that the wall will be a major construction project in the game.

* Construction was happening in Rome as well. **The Pantheon** was started, still standing today as one of the finest ancient buildings in the world. It was a transformative era for the city under Hadrian, and I'm sure we will be building this monument as well.

* A widespread Jewish revolt in places like Egypt, Libya, and Cyprus was crushed by Trajan that year, so this could give us some hints about the military side of the game and the narrative: **putting down revolts.** I don't know what else was going on militarily around this time in terms of locations and technology. I'm sure the Anno fanbase has plenty of Roman military buffs, so please share some info and ideas.

It's such a rich year for an empire building game to be set in. We're in for a real treat.",https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1ddbn0z/heres_why_117_is_a_perfect_year_for_a_roman_anno/,anno

1eucern,tiringandretiring,2024-08-17 15:53:29,Have been playing this game on the Switch for the last week-some thoughts so far:,36,12,"1) The protagonist is pretty well done-has some fun lines, some cute reactions opening chests and idle animations, etc...

2) I thought I would hate the narration, but it's ok. It's not Mimr/Kratos banter level, but it's ok. I also love greek mythology, and I'm enjoying their retelling of it. 

 3) I have to admit I almost quit during one of the early Vaults (Aphrodite's Bewilderment). I found the controls very frustrating, and the whole carrying/moving/tossing crates around just tedious and so imprecise. I also just had trouble with the flying controls-I fell to my death so often. Just a really unpleasant experience, lol.

4) But, after that debacle, the vaults have been much more doable, and I've actually been enjoying some of the puzzles.  (I've completed several, including 3 of the hardest level vaults, a couple arenas and two wraith dens) 

5) One thing that wasn't that clear to me-you really do need to get all the traversal abilities, the slow arrow control ability, and the heavy lifting ability as soon as possible. It's not just they make parts of the game a little easier-parts of the game are just completely frustrating/impossible without them, IMHO. 

  
6) I feel like the controls are a bit sloppy, even for a Ubisoft game. I'm assuming it is the same engine as the recent Assassin's Creed games, which I've played them all, and this one just feels less refined to me-although those didn't rely on precision platform jumping and flying like this one. I'm not sure if the engine is well suited for Mario style precision this game requires.

7) The potions...man, the thorn defense potions are seriously OP, lol. Even if you normally don't use buffs in games (like me), you might want to try these buffs if you are having trouble with fighting. They can completely change an encounter (and I'm sure people must be doing ""no potion"" runs to challenge themselves)

Anyways, I'm on my third god (love Ares!), and hope the game doesn't stick me with a bunch more of Aphrodites Bewilderment vaults to discourage me, lol.

1cg3t91,ka_zz,2024-04-30 00:43:21,[Solved] 99.56% Total Game Progression.,8,0,"s*croll down for TL;DR;  version*

## The glitch 

Many players are reporting problems with reaching 100% in the Ubi Connect stats.

This may happen to you even you reach 100% in quests and Vaults.

  
It is a glitch, doesn't happen often, and support have trouble reproducing it. However once I figure out what is the issue it's easy to fix.

  
The problem is in the game epilog. There are 225 ""checks  points"" withing the game, it is not obvious what they are but you don't need to know that. If you are stack at 99.56% that means you passed 224 out of 225. (224 / 225 = 0.995555...) and as the intuition suggest it is the last one.

Sometimes when you finished the main story. The final quest (The Spider's Web) and the final vault are mark as completed but that check point used for game progressing either fails, or we skip it by accident, or it's bypassed when NG+ mode is being unlocked, that part is not cleared.

To get your 100% you need to trigger that check point again. Locate the save that was created at point of no return, in English it is called ""Typhon Save"", you should be able to locate it easily by looking at the typ of a save (Quick save, Manual save etc.)

[Typhon Save](https://preview.redd.it/4j9ri0nq2gxc1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=e20132824bdaa40508052b0cb83bd7041d4cf7ad)

You can lower difficulty to Story if what to cheese it. After you are done just locate the last save with whatever difficulty you were playing.

When asked if you want to move on to DLCs or NG+ choose go back to title screen instead. You can also shut down the game to trigger ubi connect sync, but I think that is not needed.

The might be a couple min delay before your stats get's updated.

## TL;DR;

  
1. Beat the game once.  
2. Load the Tyhon Save.  
3. Lower Difficulty to Story (optional)  
4. Beat Typhon again  
5. After all cut-sceens select 'back to title\`  
6. Close the game and let Ubisoft Connect Sync  
7. Run game again, load the last save from before you went back to Typhon save (this reverts massing with Difficulty)  
8. Save Manually to mark your currnet state as latest.

1g6zchu,AUSLC,2024-10-19 10:42:42,Possible solution for low quality textures on PC (Nvidia GPU),2,1,"Like some other people on this subreddit I had poor qualty textures on many models in game. I could not find a solution but after about 70 hours in game I managed to get all textures to load in properly. The key seems to be setting AA to enhance application and 4x in the nvidia control panel. I also turned on anisotropic filetring to 16x, AA - transparency to 4x, AA- gama correction to on and texture filtering to high quality. I do believe AA to 4x is the key setting. In particular, setting it to 4x as opposed to 2x makes a dramtic difference to the quality of some armors, like the cloak for Byzantine armor from the Ireland DLC.

I am assuming at some point in the past 4 years Ubisoft accidentally introduced a bug when optimising that made textures on some set ups fail to load in. the NVCP AA is MSAA so I believe my GPU is essentially supersampling the textures, reversing this optimisation bug.

Please note I am playing at 4k, ultra settings, 100% resolution and no FSR.

EDIT: It is also necessary for negative LOD bias to be set to allow.

Melee combat is an absolute no go in every single situation no matter even if you master the parry entirely and upgrade your sword entirely there's still those repugnant brutes that just can't be dealt with. 

Also you can't cut alarm bells for the first time ever which means theres always brutes and then whats essentially (phylakes) directly after that with no way to avoid them and thats being barely spotted just one time

I tried pushing through till I got smoke bombs and the blow pipe which are fun to use but even with that and all the tool upgrades they still don't do shit to the enemies in this game. 

I've never played any game that made me feel so toxic and hateful towards not just the franchise but modern games as a whole. If the game causes player burnout this bad i cant even imagine the toxic hell the developers of this game had to put up with from ubi

It looks bad, but there's a reason lmao.  During one playthrough I stumbled upon the body of a Daughter of Lerion who hadnt despawned real-world days after I killed her, so I decided in a subsequent playthrough (the one in the image) to bring each one to Ravensthorpe after winning so I didn't have to go travel across the map to several locations to confirm their persistence. It turned Eivor's bedroom into a veritable serial killer lair 😂  
  
I don't think they ever despawned!  It makes me wonder who else's body is persistent and how many dead people you could conceivably stack up in Ravensthorpe.

So let's assume, *arguendo*, that sexuality in ancient Scandinavia was the freewheeling smorgasbord that AC Valhalla depicts.  It wasn't, but as Ubisoft is always quick to explain, this is *based* on real stuff.  Historicity is great and all, but not when it interferes with a fun story underlying a top-notch game.

The game and story both seem to want consequence, at least to some degree.  Choices made during a campaign can affect future campaigns and require clean-up work when Eivor makes the wrong call.  At the end of it all, Sigurd does a post-game wrap-up, cataloguing choices Eivor has made through various dialog options.

[\\""And through it all, you've been banging my wife.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/bet2mqhqtlqd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=08f61e569671fef16848ec570c97fc22d737c053)

How is this an option?  The main character is almost shoved into banging his brother's wife.  And if, consistent with the rest of the game, this led to anything resembling, I don't know: a consequence, a reaction, or at least some sort of emotional dilemma, it wouldn't be quite so jarring.  But no, banging your brother's wife on the regular, *on top of the Alliance Map no less*, has less consequence than just killing that pet turkey in New Brunswick.

The beginning and ending stretches were just incredible, some of the best moments I've experienced in a while. The snows and music of Norway, fighting the first Drengr completely underleveled, the Asgard/Isu parallels, the conclusion of Eivor becoming Jarl, Gunnar's wedding, Aelfred's twist and his incredible music that made me reflect on my whole journey.

And oh boy did I reflect on the absolute fucking dogshit that made the journey. The menial sidequests. The forgettable and repetetive alliances. The worthless points of interest. The floaty and pillowy combat. The breakable walls with no oil in sight. The rigid movement. I got so sick of it all I just beelined the story last 20 hours, best decision I've probably made. 

I honestly have no idea what kept me playing, maybe it's the sunken cost fallacy, maybe it's my love for AC but I'm glad I did get to the end, it honestly floored me and made all of it worth it.

Edit:

I disagree with most of you, but I realize I should have been more specific about what kind of repetition bothers me in *Odyssey*, particularly when it comes to quest design. My issue isn't with repeated character models in the open world, no one expects to scrutinize the faces of characters while riding a horse, driving, or biking. It's impractical and, honestly, not what most players focus on. 

What I’m talking about is the noticeable reuse of characters in quests. For example, there's a child who appears across multiple quests, not only in the base game but also in the DLCs. This type of repetition pulls you out of the story and affects immersion, which is why I feel Ubisoft should have handled it better because it’s not about background characters; it’s about specific quest driven interactions that become less engaging when the same character models are reused.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AssassinsCreedOdyssey/comments/1gd97qw/is_it_just_me_or_has_ubisoft_reused_child_models/,AssassinsCreedOdyssey

Call me what you will. I've got to master this game! I love and yet am frustrated with it. Coming from the days of Atari and Pong, I've played lots of games, and I do have favorites, but this one I cannot beat. I know it never truly ends, and that's pretty cool, but the DLCs I absolutely hate. The grinding in any DLC, but especially in Atlantis, is dreadful. I've never made it past Hades. Some bosses and elites don't fight fair, like Hades, and THAT fucking BOAR. You need to engrave a good weapon with the upgrade for elites and bosses! Just go ahead and do a main game playthrough and start a new game plus. Keep going (I was willing because the quests and cutscenes with Sokrates are so much fun and Alkibiates in keeps sending you on progressively creepy yet hilarious quests). The game's story is fun. It's not for everyone, we've seen that. But if either character appeals to you and you get immersed, you will not be let down.
Some suggestions: become a heavy blunt weapon master and use The Mallet of Everlasting Flame! By the time you control it well, two heavy strikes can kill boars, lynx (the most bothersome land predator) and even bear.
But I favor the distant fight with Hades's bow and built up abilities. Rain of Arrows can kill inside fortress walls while you're safe outside. The Ghost Arrows of Artemis can shoot through walls and even the ground. I once waited for 1 adrenaline every time I used it from outside of Herakles's cell. I thought it was and insult when I heard him say ""You fight like an Argonaut!"" Because of course he couldn't ""see"" me. I chuckle at that but the full quote is, ""Respect! You fight like an Argonaut!""
Use your Eagle Vision! I know it's more challenging not to but you'll desynch like you're on a tailing mission. Sit through enough load screens that you become catatonic, you'll reconsider. Besides, you don't want to fight sharks underwater. Once you get Death Arrows (or just normal arrows), stand at the edge of Adrestia and shoot them from the surface.
Always keep your distance, but when you can't, the Mallet of Everlasting Flame can take down any Merc with three or four hits. That's if they catch you on the road and rush you, closing too fast for you to draw an arrow back.
Find Poseidon's Trident! Breathing underwater is necessary for deep treasures and inside wreckage or ruins.
Take every chance you can to upgrade the ship. Go with the hull first, then the ram, then the arrows, and then fire for arrows. Later, you'll be so powerful that a few javelin volleys will sink most any ship. Don't let Barnabas stop you with his incessant warnings. By the time you know what to do, he gets to be a bit boring.
Go ahead and take side quests. You grind on, because some of them are challenging and some are too funny to miss out on.
Use Mastery Level skill points wisely, and put them towards what you need, but that fits your style. The more you dismantle gear you don't need, the less worried you'll be about Drachmae (the Dracma was used by Greece until the year 2002, when they adopted the Euro because their economy was in terrible shape).
I checked. There is a difference between Phobos's skins. Therefore, skins make a difference with everything. Consistency is a mark of great devs. It's really too bad these developers don't get what they should.
Play how you want. Have fun, because there's so much to see and do! You get to attend a symposium with Herodotus and Sokrates, and even the uproariously ridiculous Alkibiates, AND, in the same game, find out your real father is none other than Pythagoras, who's been living at the gate to Atlantis for over a century! Well, until he left long enough to impregnate your mother. But in the same game? The Minotaur, Cyclops, and the (Medusa) gorgon? I can only say one last thing. My son passed in 2018. We used to game all the time, and that's a very good king of memory. Since then, I've buried myself in single player games, in his honor, memory, and because I'll never do multiplayer again.

It crashes my entire computer as well. Sometimes just plain black screen other times it just freezes. One time my entire graphics drivers became invalid. Yes my GPU driver was no longer working!

I want to start by venting some! It's insane how a years old game can be this unstable! Like holy shit I know Ubisoft suck ass but this much ass? I had no idea!

Has everyone playing the recent AC games experienced where your credits purchased in the Ubisoft store for use on Assassin’s Creed titles, are NOT SHARED between titles when playing a new title in the franchise?

What has been your experience with this? When did you discover that you couldn’t use the game’s in game currency across AC titles?

All I’ve seen is this language:
“Please note that Helix Credits are bound to the platform and account you purchased them for, and cannot be shared.”

So, I get not being able to go between platforms (PS, PC, Xbox) but if using the same account on PlayStation for example, you’d expect to see unused credits show up in the new game, right??

(English is not my first language so there will be some mistakes sry)



I recently bought a new PC, including a new graphics card, and when I tried to play Assassin's Creed Origins, the game didn't launch. Although this problem has been solved, it doesn't make sense (having an RTX Nvidia 4070 Super, I had to lower the graphics settings to ""medium"", but whatever, I'll say it in case it's useful to identify the problem.)

After a few hours, I was able to play the game for about thirty minutes (until the entrance of the first town), and then the game froze with the music still playing in the background. No more interaction is possible with the game, so a total freeze. I stopped the game via task control, and restarted it. It happened 2 or 3 times before I could continue to play, and each time it happened to me with a few meters of difference.



Then, the tutorial for assassination arrives, and when displaying the tutorial menu, the game freezes again. I restarted the game, it didn't freeze at the same time, but still froze and I respawned at the assassination of the first soldier (after a few tries).



I have restarted a good dozen times since that (bug occurred on 10/27/2024 for info), I reinstalled the launcher, reinstalled the game on another disk (not external this time), checked the files, checked that there were no residues from another game, I tried on a new game file to check that it was not corrupted or something like that, I lowered the graphics settings to the maximum (no overheating by the way) and I tried with the controller and not keyboard + mouse. Nothing changed.



I've been looking around the forums, I've read about an Nvidia version that would reveal a bug in the game, but from what I understand, Nvidia and Ubisoft are rejecting the responsibility on one another, and I don't even know if that corresponds to my problem.

  
PS : I've also sent a ticket to Ubisoft, but wanted to ask directly to the community that knows the game well.



Anyway, do you have a solution maybe ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AssassinsCreedOrigins/comments/1ge0oso/help_game_freeze_i_cant_play/,AssassinsCreedOrigins

Verify game files to make sure the issues is not there.

Completely uninstall NVIDIA graphics and re-install the latest version as well as an older version.

Lowering graphics from ultra to very high

Limiting FPS to 90

Opening Ubisoft Connect as an administrator

Making sure windows firewall is not blocking anything specific

Deleting everything on Ubisoft Connect and reinstalling the game and launcher again

Confirming the issue is specific to the game and can still play other games on ultra high (such as Destiny 2) without any issue.

Hi guys! Wanted to talk about Egyptian gods in Origins and how they fit into the whole Isu lore. As far know Isis and Osiris existed and are documented (Using the Ankh to revive Osiris, among other things), but these don't have animal heads, so it's not a problem placing them among other Isu like Aletheia, Poseidon, Hermes, etc without much narrative overthinking. I haven't read the comics nor anything related to this topic so I don't know how Ubi are portraying (apart from the animus glitch) other gods such as Sobek, Sekhmet, Anubis, Ra and Horus to fit within the Isu lore as the animal heads don't make much sense to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AssassinsCreedOrigins/comments/1dkwgwe/egyptian_gods_as_isu/,AssassinsCreedOrigins

[Here are the patch notes.](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2751000/view/6215616669618800922)

I've been waiting to post this because I keep hoping that Ubisoft will patch the feature back in, but I don't think it will happen.

I remembered that [Ubisoft removed cloud saves from Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag on PC](https://x.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1645739808126279680) and to this day still hasn't brought them back, despite other AC games supporting that feature.

This time they disabled automatic cloud saves in Prince of Persia in order to prevent an issue some people were having where progress was lost. But the ironic part is [now people are losing progress anyways by not knowing that they have to manually upload their saves](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2751000/discussions/0/4426562436920028247/). Perhaps they are playing on multiple devices, or they uninstalled the game and came back to it later to see their saves gone.

To be fair, they did add a feature that enables you to at least **manually** back up one of your saves to the cloud, but it isn't obvious. If you have to stop playing in a hurry, you may easily forget to upload your save. And many users aren't aware of this ""feature"" in the first place.

Here are some more examples of people being confused about their saves missing after this update. Yes, many of these are Steam Deck examples because A) Deck users are more likely to be playing a game on multiple devices, and B) This style of game is especially well suited to a handheld. But others will notice it over time when they come back in 3, 4, 10 years to 100% the game and see their saves are gone.

[Example 1 (literally posted today)](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2751000/discussions/0/6989114975920757902/)

[Example 2](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2751000/discussions/0/4854406759561032370/)

[Example 3](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2751000/discussions/0/4854406951640524504/)

[Example 4](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2751000/discussions/0/4854406759563145357/)

**I think it's reasonable to assume in 2024 that your saves will just automatically upload to the cloud for a game from an AAA publisher.** It seems that this is an issue that wouldn't be a problem if Ubisoft Connect wasn't required on PC, and if Ubisoft made use of the Steam Cloud feature which already works great.

In addition to things like having to hunt down your phone that you left in another room in order to enter a 2FA code, remember a 2nd password, etc. I feel Ubisoft is introducing unnecessary barriers to people just playing their games, and I wouldn't be surprised if it contributes towards the negative sentiment towards them + slower sales.

**This issue further highlights that Ubisoft Connect should be optional for features like cross-progression, rewards, etc. If they led with the carrot vs the stick, people wouldn't have such a problem with it. Especially when the stick isn't working as intended.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1g1j7xt/ubisoft_fixed_an_automatic_cloud_save_issue_in/,pcgaming

1bl9yuy,Consistent_Car_2530,2024-03-23 04:58:56,PS4 retrospective,9,38,"What can be said about the PS4? After the PS3 which stumbled in the early days due to many reasons; most of all being the highest priced console, lackluster first party support and inferior third party game ports for most of its generation (complicated hardware), strong competition from hugely popular 360 & Wii, popularization of portable gaming (especially in Japan) with PSP, DS, smartphone etc., but ultimately regaining old fame & popularity towards the end of the generation with strong exclusives and cheaper redesigned console, Sony finally released its successor in 2013. Shockingly it was the only relevant home console that outsold competition by quite a few times, even more than PS2 in its time.

That can be mainly attributed due to weak offerings from competing consoles, Xbox One which didn't have a strong headstart like 360, small library of exclusive games, higher price tag yet weaker hardware due to necessary Kinect add on which wasn't utilized for most of the time, controversy in its reveal surrounding used games, always online and focus on mostly streaming services instead of games.

On the other hand there was the Wii U which is one of the most infamous failed consoles in history, especially jarring compared to the hugely popular Wii. On paper everything made sense, let's update old hardware to finally run HD games, combine it with the touchscreen display that DS popularized and success is guaranteed. In reality looking away from TV screen to gamepad display all the time was cumbersome, console arrived too late so hardware couldn't compete with upcoming PS4/Xone released just a year after, it was mostly comparable to PS3/360 that even then overstayed their welcome and could barely keep up with PC ports.
As for portable gaming on the other hand it was released too early so hardware wasn't there yet, only some games were semi-portable meaning you played them without a TV with a gamepad display but you still had to plug the console in outlet. And non-existent third party support after a few launch titles doomed the console.

In some ways it can be said that PS4 saved gaming as we know it, it was the only choice for the middle market for those who didn't want to bother with PCs yet found casual smartphone gaming too simple, without it the AAA industry probably wouldn't exist in the same way as today. But not everything was sunshine and rainbows.

Games themselves became too expensive so they had to appeal to a wider market as possible so games became too homogeneous. Third person open world games became the norm. RPG elements began to permeate in every game yet ironically Western RPGs almost died with commercial failures from Bethesda and Bioware (and mediocre Final Fantasy XV) which discouraged other studios from developing one RPG for 3, 4 or more years that is never going to sell as much as an action game made in half that time. Activision, Ubisoft and EA which were actually the best publishers for PS3/360 era with many of their games in top charts and more often than not better than first party titles became too greedy and started developing live services instead of games with seasonal passes, DLCs, pre order bonuses, copy paste gameplay and maps, etc. 

Even the FPS genre barely survived without exclusives and with Call of Duty multiplayer nowhere as popular as before and linear singleplayer that almost no one wasn't interested in anymore with open world titles like Far Cry or frenetic and fast Doom or story driven games like Wolfenstein… Battlefield and Halo almost died… Franchises like Medal of Honor, Brothers in Arms, Bioshock, Crysis, Rainbow Six completely gone without any replacements.
Linear third person cover shooters also disappeared in favor of generic open world ones.
Rhythm games like Guitar Hero were also hugely popular in PS3/360 era with “too many for its own good” titles yet barely any for PS4.

At least Japanese companies finally found a foothold in the HD era and their games and surprisingly JRPGs rose in popularity just like in the PS2 era. And indie titles became more impressive and varied with many genres besides mostly 2D sidescrollers like before. And there were quite a few HD remasters to add to the game variety.

Overall in some ways the PS4 era leaves something to be desired but the undeniable truth is that never before there were that many quality games and they never were more ambitious or looked better.

1fh6z37,rikkyboby,2024-09-15 15:25:40,Looking for open world rpg,93,147,"Hi, I love the style specifically of Ubisoft games. The ones that are like third person combat, where you have an open world map and small objectives all over and collectables. You complete zones and missions and there’s a boss in each zone increasing gear and skills along the way. Everything you do works towards 100% and and the replay-ability is pretty high. 

I have played and own Saints Row 3-4, Fenix rising, Pokémon scarlet(possibly with the gym leaders), far cry, and infamous. 
Open to all suggestions as I really like these games and can play them for hours and hours trying to achieve 100%. Thank you

(Edited) Thank you all for suggestions- I have decided upon hogwarts legacy, Witcher 3, and breath of the wild. I do have Skyrim and ToTk and they are a fun addition but not what I’m looking to sink 200 hours into at this moment, I may try ToTk after I complete BoTW. Thank you everyone for input, everything is great options, just the three I’ve listed seem like the best fit for what I’m looking for. Thank you!

I’ll start. Immortals Fenyx Rising. It just looked dumb and cheap to me, probably because the cover art reminded me of those low-effort mobile app games you see ads for everywhere. Then, when I found out it was Ubisoft I was turned off because I associated them with Rayman and Mario+Rabbids, two games I tried but couldn’t get into at all. Hey, now I know they make plenty more but I was and still am a pretty casual gamer, so don’t hate me! 

Someone here recommended Immortals and I’m glad I took a chance and downloaded the demo. Fun combat, intuitive controls, decent graphics, pretty big area to explore even in the demo. Now it’s on my wish list.

1g6y1bx,AL2009man,2024-10-19 09:29:31,"How do you define Steam's ""Full Controller Support"" tag?",0,3,"There have been some threads regarding ""Controller Support."", but this time: I have a question regarding the definition of ""Full Controller Support"" tag on Steam.

Last week, while doing some side-project work on PCGamingWiki: [I came across a forum post at PCGamingWiki](https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/topic/4983-field-for-manual-switching-of-controller-button-prompts-in-input/page/2/#comment-19551) that claimed that Steam Input API shouldn't be considered ""Full Controller Support"" as it may mislead users into thinking the game has Controller Support when it might not be the case.

This is in context to certain games on Steam that may opt to rely on Steam Input API as their form of ""Controller Support"", without any option to fallback to the game's own built-in Controller Support (see: No Man's Sky \[steam edition\], Tales of Arise, Spin Rhythm XD, Aperture Desk Job)

They believe, and I'll quote:

>**Full Controller Support** designation should be reserved exclusively for games that inherently support controllers without the need for third-party software or extensive configuration.

>The Steam Input API counts as third-party software, since the Controller Support is coming from Steam itself and does not function if you disable the Steam hook (overlay).

>PCGamingWiki has Game Pages, not Steam Pages, so claiming a game that relies on the Steam Input API as having **Full Controller Support** is beyond misleading.

but here's the problem: \`***Full Controller Support***\` is meant to represent the ""Big Picture Mode""/Steam Deck experience, **where the entire game can be downloaded, launched into the game, and all menu UIs can be navigated without requiring a Keyboard/Mouse**. This applies to the Configuration tool (Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, most Nixxes-lead ports) or third-party launchers (Ubisoft Connected, EA Play)

If portions of the menu cannot be navigated with a game controller: it should be labeled as ""**Partial Controller Support**"".

This is actually consistent with how Steam defines ""Full Controller Support"" in most game's storepage, alongside a special icon on each Controller device type.

[from Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster](https://preview.redd.it/9gjdwo4s9mvd1.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=e72315c9fbbb5d1810ace8f440d6564d47d17f2a)

All of this is already explained on [Steam's Big Picture mode support page](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3725-76D3-3F31-FB63#controller):

https://preview.redd.it/eyr7gq5z8mvd1.png?width=1993&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd20d3b62b47dcc979ee47ad5f11e4639fda4e65

Personally: I consider Steam Input to be **it's own Controller Type** in a similar vein as PlayStation, Nintendo, and Xbox Controller support. In addition: ""Full Controller Support"", in the context of those who are either playing on Steam Deck or have a Home Theater PC setup, is fine as it currently is...

but that got me questioning. how does one define what is ""Full Controller Support"" vs. ""Controller Support"", and how do people can determine if a game has ""Full Controller Support""? Some games mislabel them, after all.

So: I'm going to present a question to you, the reader, with two questions:

1. How do you believe how ""Full/Partial Controller Support"" should be interpreted?
2. Do you believe Steam Input usage (either Steam Input API or Steam Virtual Gamepad/SteamInput Hook) be an absolute factor on how a game should be labeled as ""Full Controller Support""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1g6y1bx/how_do_you_define_steams_full_controller_support/,Steam

Preferring 3rd party as PS studios are all so good so they’re too obvious. I like talking about gaming and between sharing and reading others, I feel we can bring attention to either unknown devs or well known devs and their games for anyone that doesn’t know. I won’t use this as a rec necessarily tho, I just want to share and read what others share and hopefully we can discuss about our posts. I’ll start :)

RGG Studios- I beat both judgement games, 0, Gaiden and played 1, 7, and ishin with plans to play/ beat Pirate Yakuza. The melodramatic stories are really good and imo rival some of the best drama shows, the side stories and mini games are genius for relaxing from the drama, the beat em up combat is so fun like why isn’t their more street brawling AAA games. Also I like just walking through a realistic feeling city district grabbing food and doing activities. 10/10 studio

Ubisoft- Doesnt everyone enjoy fast food lol? Now I’m glad others knocked them into some sense with their optimization, but I actually do like their open worlds, specifically AC and Watchdogs ofc but also outlaws as well. My favorite AC is actually Valhalla. I just enjoy how they build their worlds and the world activities and side quests work for me. The stories are just okay and I don’t like the bloat, but in terms of video games as getaways from reality, that’s still their bread and butter, let’s just pray they put that same effort into optimization with outlaws underperforming

Remedy- only because control, but also watching any review or video essay of them is as entertaining as watching one for Bethesda. The difference is control clicked more. Quantum break was dope asl too but I need 60 fps to finish. Alan wake 2 looks soo good so im actually going to beat the first one this weekend so AW2 can be another reason to love remedy. Also they helped with Returnal and that’s a top ps5 game imo. Can’t wait for them to make films alongside the games.

Honorable mentions

Techland- the long term support is amazing along with their games
2k/Take Two- ofc GTA and NBA2k, mafia too, I don’t like their live service focus tho
Annapurna- many indie gems, highlighting cat game too lol

TLDR:I like RGG, Ubisoft, Remedy because of story, worlds, gameplay respectively

Note: No FromSoftware Games discounted, no Stellar Blade. Not a lot of horror games but that should change soon. Halloween PSN sale should launch Oct. 23.

**PSN Deal of the Week:** [**Lies of P (-40$, $41.99)**](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/eff78812-7d8a-4871-935d-71626db857fe/1)

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

* **NBA 2K25 (-30%, $48.99)** – Literally the only basketball game in town. If you like basketball, the NBA, you pretty much only have this as your lone choice. Not a bad entry, but be prepared for gargantuan patches.
* **Madden NFL 25 (-35%, $45.49)** – Same as with the NBA 2K series, this is the only NFL game on consoles.
* **EA Sports MVP Bundle: Madden NFL 25 + College Football 25 (-25%, $112.49)** – Don’t play football games, but based on reviews, College Football is the superior title. If you’re planning on picking both up, this is the first time it’s on sale.
* **Destiny 2: The Final Shape (-40%, $29.99)** – Doesn’t go on sale often. The latest expansion for Destiny 2.
* **GTA 5 (-50%, $19.99)** – PS4 version is $5 less. This is the lowest it’ll go, so if you’re one of the handful that still doesn’t own this, here’s your chance to line Rockstar’s coffers.
* **Hogwarts Legacy (-70%, $20.99)** – PS4 version is a few bucks less, but this is the version to get. At that price, this should be an impulse buy unless you hate wizards, witches or casting spells. Prepare to make a name for yourself as the youngest wizard with the highest killcount in history.
* **Star Wars Jedi Survivor (-60%, $27.99)** – PS4 version surprisingly costs more. This is the version to get. Souls but with a Jedi flavor. Better than the first one in almost every way, and Cal can run properly here. Third game in development, so this is a good time to get into the franchise.
* **It Takes Two (-75%, $9.99)** – Goes on sale almost every other week. Definitely worth it, but just bear in mind you need a co-op partner to play this,
* **Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered (-50%, $24.99)** – Rarely goes on sale, and this isn’t a bad price at all. If you haven’t played this franchise yet, now might be a good start.
* **Cyberpunk 2077 (-40%, $29.99)** – Rocky launch, but now in a stable state. This is what CDPR envisioned for the game. Definitely worth a buy now.
* **Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC (-15%, $25.49)** – Jampacked with content. If you’re done with the main story, then pick this up.
* **Red Dead Redemption 2(-67%, $19.79)** – Even if you’re not a fan of Westerns, this is still a must-play. Amazing story, gameplay and loads of Easter eggs. Actually prefer this over GTA5.
* **Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart (-58%, $29.39)** – Amazing platformer, loads of weapons to use. Has that rift mechanic that’s only possible on PS5. Give this a shot.
* **Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League (-80%, $13.99)** – The lowest I’ve seen this on PSN. Might be heading to PS Plus soon? It’s worth a try at that price, but depends on how much you like these type of games. Just be mindful that support should be ceasing soon.
* *Mortal Kombat 11 (-50%, $24.99)* – Possibly the lowest I’ve seen it on PSN so far. Your dose of violence, and latest Khaos Reigns content drop was just released and brings Animalities.
* **Avatar Frontiers of Pandora (-50%, $34.99)** – Might be the lowest it’s been on PSN without a bundle. Ubisoft’s formula but with an Avatar coating. Better than expected.
* **Still Wakes the Deep (-33%, $23.44)** – Fairly new. Have this but haven’t started yet. Surprised to see it here this fast.
* **Cuphead (-30%, $13.99)** – DLC is also on sale. Gorgeous visuals, tight controls but hard as hell.
* **F1 24 (-50%, $34.99)** – Latest F1 game from Codemasters. If you’re a fan, then this is a good buy.
* **The Last of Us Part 1 Digital Deluxe (-38%, $49.59)** – Just in case you haven’t played this, still a bit high.
* **WWE 2K24 (-50%, $49.99)** – Free this month for PS+, solid wrestling game and still getting DLCs.
* **Skull and Bones (-60%, $27.99)** – Unsure how well this turned out, but apparently there’s enough players to support its seasonal content.
* **Witcher 3 (-75%, $9.99)** – Super low price, and this is one of my all-time fave games. Fantastic side quests, meaty experience all around. Once you get past the floaty controls/combat, and once it clicks, it’s one hell of an experience. Expansion is also on sale and worth the price.
* **Battlefield 2042 (-$85%, $10.49)** – Worth it at that price. Game is in a much better state now than before.
* **AC Valhalla (-75%, $14.99)** – Assassin’s Creed Vikings! Insane amount of content, though overstays its welcome a bit.
* **Borderlands 3 (-90%, $5.99)** – Looter shooter but not live service. Insane action, and a steal at that price.
* **Earth Defense Force 6 (-20%, $47.99)** – If you dig these types of games, might be worth a pickup.
* **The Outlast Trials (-33%, $33.49)** – Multiplayer-focused horror game. Still getting lots of support.
* **GTA The Trilogy (-50%, $29.99)** – Unsure how performance is nowadays. Three games in one in case you want more GTA gaming before GTA6 drops.
* **Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy (-60%, $15.99)** – Crash platforming. Harder than it looks.
* **Mafia Trilogy (-75%, $14.99)** – Three Mafia games in one. Definitely not a bad deal, and there’s a new one on the way.
* **Star Wars Battlefront 2 (-70%, $5.99)** – Definitely worth the price. No content support incoming, but servers still up and someone said here previously that there’s no shortage of players. Fun to smash people around playing as your favorite Star Wars character.
* **LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga (-75%, $14.99)** – Star Wars adventure with Lego humor. Fun to play with kids or your partner.
* **Payday 3 (-60%, $15.99)** – Lowest I’ve seen this on PSN. Not sure if worth it now, but still getting loads of support.
* **Horizon Burning Shores (-50%, $9.99)** – First time I’ve seen this on sale. In case you want more for the game, then this DLC should scratch that itch.
* **Powerwash Simulator (-30%, $17.49)** – Doesn’t go on sale often. Surprisingly fun and getting regular support.
* **Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order (-75%, $9.99)** – If you’re planning on playing the trilogy, then this is your starting point. Lots of backtracking and Cal runs like he has crap in his pants that will never be OK.
* **Dead by Daylight Gold Edition (-40%,$41.99)** – Heavily supported, and DLCs are also on sale. Asymmetrical horror game for those who want something different.
* **Metro Saga Bundle (-85%, $8.99)** – Three games from the Metro franchise at a discounted rate.
* **Far Cry 6 (-75%, $14.99)** – Solid first-person campaign, and stars Giancarlo Esposito as the baddie.
* **Detroit Become Human (-50%, $9.99)** – More of an interactive movie than a game, but still solid. If you haven’t played Quantic’s games, it’s like Supermassive’s titles.
* **Midnight Suns (-75%, $17.49)** – Strategy with Marvel characters. Surprisingly fun even without MCU likenesses, and has solid length and depth.
* **Pacific Drive (-40%, $17.99)** – First-person driving survival game that’s still getting a lot of support.
* **Divinity Original Sin 2 (-65%, $20.99)** – Larian’s breakout hit. If you want your RPGs deep and long.
* **Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition (-20%, $15.99) –** First time this is on sale. If you ever wanted to play the cult classic, then this is the newest way of doing so. You might finish it in time for the sequel which should be coming any day now…
* **Persona 3 Reload Digital Deluxe Edition (-40%, $47.99) –** If you’re looking to play Persona 3, then this is it. Just got it last DLC drop this September as well.
* **System Shock (-40%, $23.99)** – Remake of a classic. SHODAN!
* **For Honor (-85%, $4.49)** – Multiplayer action game but more melee focused. Still getting loads of support after all these years.
* **Flintlock Siege of Dawn (-25%, $29.99)** – AA action game that didn’t sell well. Might be worth a look? Surely will go down in price more in a few months though.
* **Sifu (-60%, $15.99)** – Beat-’em-up but with more modern mechanics. Neat aging system for life, and harder than expected. Fun when you know what you’re doing.
* **Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 Turbocharged (-75%, $12.49)** -Still getting support. If you like your racing games more arcade-y than sim.
* **Hi-Fi Rush (-40%, $17.99)** – Tango’s last game before leaving Microsoft. JP style action-adventure. GOTY contender as well.
* **Mass Effect Legendary Edition (-85%, $8.99)** – Will never not recommend this. Probably my fave RPG trilogy of all-time. You can get your money’s worth with just the first game, but to have your decisions carry over until the last one? Yean, BioWare at their peak!
* **LA Noire (-50%, $19.99)** – Still priced high for an old game. Amazing visuals and makes you feel like a detective.
* **Back 4 Blood (-90%, $5.99)** – Support has ended but still fun if you can round up friends for co-op.
* **Need for Speed Unbound (-85%, $10.49)** – Still getting support somewhat. Arcade racing and has a less serious take on the franchise. Controls feel a bit floaty for me.
* **Banishers Ghosts of New Eden (-30%, $41.99)** – Criminally underrated game. Not AAA, but certain aspects of it do feel AAA. Combat is ists weakest link but it has a lot of content, good story and loads of secrets.
* **Tomb Raider I-III Remastered (-50%, $14.99)** – The old Tomb Raider games but with added sheen. Prepare for pixelated Lara and lots of mindless jumping while shooting.
* **Gotham Knights (-80%, $13.99)** – Underperformed but still fun. At that price, might be worth jumping into it just to test out the combos you can pull off since each character has their own moveset.
* **Lords of the Fallen (-50%, $34.99)** – The reboot. Sequel is in development and the studio pushed out a ton of new features and whatnot.
* **Crash Bandicoot Bundle: N. Sane Trilogy + CTR Nitro-Fueled (-65%, $26.24) –** Crash overload! Platforming and kart racing in a bundle.
* **Titanfall 2 (-75%, $4.99)** – One of the best FPS’ ever made. Play the campaign and jump into the multiplayer to get melted by sweats.
* **Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes (-35%, $32.49)** – Old-school RPG that surprisingly sold and reviewed well. Still getting support and this is the first time it’s on sale on PSN if I’m not mistaken.
* **Shadow of the Tomb Raider (-80%, $3.99)** – Didn’t finish it, but it’s a solid third-person action game. At that price? Yeah, definitely worth a shot.
* **Alone in the Dark (-30%, $41.99)** – Nota successful remake, but not a bad one either. It’s OK. Combat is nothing special and graphics won’t blow anyone away. Ambience is fine, and worth a look for horror fans.
* **A Plague Tale Bundle (-60%, $31.99)** – Don’t play if you get scared of rats, but this is a solid two games and story is well done.

* **Evil West (-60%, $23.99)** – Vampire action game. AA fare but not bad at all. Expect jank and some unpolished visuals but could do worse than this.
* **Cult of the Lamb Cultist Edition (-50%, $14.99)** – Still getting supported. Fun and surprisingly deep. Who knew it was so much fun to have your own cult.
* **Nioh Collection (-58%, $29.39) –** Team Nnja’s Souls game. Hard as nails though, but lots of fans swear how good these games are.
* **Tomb Raider Definitive (-80%, $3.99)** – The first game in the new Tomb Raider trilogy. Solid action games.
* **Rise of the Tomb Raider (-80%, $5.99)** – You can literally get all three games for less than $15.

* **Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade (-42%, $3.79)** – If you haven’t played this yet, go get started. Wil make you understand why FF7 is one of the most revered games of all-time.
* **Mega Man X Legacy Collection (-60%, $7.99)** – Includes Mega Man X1-X4. Solid titles from the 32-bit era.
* **LOTR Gollum (-85%, $8.99)** – Lowest I’ve ever seen it on PSN. Promised patches never came. Still not worth it. Buy it if you want to torture your friends.
* **Zombie Army 4 (-90%, $4.99)** – From Rebellion. Content support has ended, but this is a surprisingly fun shooter.
* **Returnal Digital Deluxe (-50%, $39.99)** – Housemarque’s first AAA title. Fun, but might not be everyone’s cup of tea.

* **Star Wars Squadrons (-80%, $7.99)** – Support has ended but the most recent game where we can dogfight with Star Wars ships.
* **Anthem (-85%, $2.99)** – Lacks content, but at that price? Might be worth to play through the campaign. Fantastic feeling of flight.
* **Prey (-80%, $5.99)** – Arkane’s finest work according to some.
* **Quantum Error (-50%, $14.99)** – Might get a deeper discount for Halloween. Janky survival horror.
* **Dredge Complete Edition (-20%, $31.59)** – Horror fishing game. Yes, you read that right. Still getting loads of support.
* **Dishonored Death of the Outsider Bundle (-80%, $11.99)** – Arkane’s finest work? Maybe the most popular.
* **Fort Solis (-35%, $22.74) –** More walking simulator than horror. If it worked for Kojima…",https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fzwbkm/playstation_store_fall_savings_promotion_launches/,PS5
1fw64n3,excaliburps,2024-10-05 02:25:42,"PSN Store Weekend Offer Sale for Oct. 4 Launched; Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Is the Deal of the Week
",567,228,"Full list of games: [https://mp1st.com/news/psn-store-weekend-offer-sale-for-oct-4-launched-marvels-spider-man-2-is-the-deal-of-the-week](https://mp1st.com/news/psn-store-weekend-offer-sale-for-oct-4-launched-marvels-spider-man-2-is-the-deal-of-the-week)

Not a lot of games in this sale, and you can check the full list to know what's available.

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is at from $79.99 to 54.39 for a limited time.

**Recommendations:**

* **GTA 5 - (67%, $19.79)** - For maybe the 2-3 people that still doesn't own this, now's your chance, as it doesn't get lower than this. Perhaps if GTA 6 is nearing launch maybe it will? But do you want to wait that long?
* **WWE 2K24 (-50%, $59.99)** - This game is free on PS Plus for October. If you aren't a member of PS Plus, then yeah, this is a solid wrestling game which has DLCs on the way.
* **Hogwarts Legacy Digital Deluxe (-70%, $23.99)** - Fun game regardless if you're a Harry Potter fan or not. No co-op or multiplayer of any kind but it lets you live the dream of becoming a mass murdering machine like Voldemort.
* **The Crew Motorfest (-60%, $27.99)** - Still getting support to this day. If you want a more arcade-y racing game.
* **AC Mirage (-50%, $24.99**) - Last year's Assassin's Creed game. Might not have made as big of a thud than Valhalla, but sitting at a generally favorable score at [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/assassins-creed-mirage/).
* **Red Dead Redemption 2 (-70%, $29.99)** - Some might not believe or like it, but this is even better than GTA 5. Fantastic story, engrossing side missions and loads of secrets. You can kill of racist mobs, get anal raped, encounter a vampire and more!
* **Madden 25 (-35%, $64.99)** - Your yearly NFL sim. Can't say if it's good or not since I'm not a football fan but if you're thinking of getting this one, then here you go.
* **Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League (-80%, $19.99)** - Season 3 just launched, but can't really say if this is worth it, since chances are, this will be on PS+ soon?!
* **Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (-55%, $40.49)** - Follow up to the Fallen Order, and better in almost every way. Cal doesn't run around like he has poop in his pants, backtracking issue has been more or less resolved. There's a third one on the way, so if you played the first one, then go pick this one up.
* **Borderlands 3 Next Level Bundle (-90%, $6.99)** - Includes a crapload of DLC and whatnot. Loads of Borderlands stuff are on sale, which fans might wnat to check out. This is well worth the purchase for those looking for some co-op loot action, and there's a free PS5 upgrade available as well.
* **A Way Out (-80%, $5.99)** - Usually on sale alongside It Takes Two, so no rush in getting it. Remember: this is a mandatory co-op game, so if you don't have anyone to play this with, don't bother.
* **Avatar Frontiers of Pandora (-50%, $39.99)** - Ubisoft open word in Avatar! All kidding aside, better than expected. The Gold Edition which includes the DLCs are also on sale.
* **Hi-Fi Rush Deluxe (-40%, $23.99)** - Tango's last game for Microsoft. GOTY contender and generally a different beast than what we usually get. Worth a pick up, but YouTube it first since the aesthetics, etc. might not be a fit for what you're looking for.
* **Midnight Suns (-75%, $19.99)** - Strategy Marvel game. Fun, good length and challenging. Not MCU but proves Marvel franchise can work in almost any genre as long as done right.
* **LEGO Star Wars Skywalker Saga Deluxe Edition (-75%, $17.49)** - Lighthearted Star Wars game you can play with friends or your kids. Familiar LEGO gameplay so expect loads of humor.
* **Mafia 3 Definitive Edition (--75%, $7.49)** - Period GTA but with a better story. There's a new one out next year, so if you want to get on-board this might be the time. Mafia 2 is also on sale for the same price.
* **AC Valhalla (-60%, $15.99)** - Viking Creed! Good action game, but be prepared to sink a lot of time into this.
* **Red Dead Redemption + RDR2 Bundle (-45%, $54.99)** - Not sure about RDR1 performance, but from a gameplay standpoint, should still hold up somewhat.
* **Gotham Knights (-80%, $17.99)** - Support has ended but the game is technically complete. Bat Family are the stars here and you can pull off some insane combos. Might be a bit repetitive, but not a bad game.
* **Back 4 Blood (-90%, $8.99)** - Zombie co-op FPS! Fun with friends. Support has ended, but servers are still up.
* **Alien Isolation The Collection (-85%, $5.99)** - Horror done with the Aliens franchise. Don't expect Resident Evil action, but loads of tense moments. Pick it up if you dig horror games.
* **XCOM 2 Collection (-90%, $9.99)** - Strategy game featuring guns, aliens and did I say strategy?! Not an easy game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fw64n3/psn_store_weekend_offer_sale_for_oct_4_launched/,PS5

1cg26l9,XulManjy,2024-04-29 23:37:22,2024 Ubisoft Forward will their biggest one yet and probably biggest event this summer ,0,22,"1) You have Star Wars Outlaws. There will no doubt be a deeper dive into this gameplay elements and story. What makes this game stand out is that its Star Wars and draws in a demographic that perhaps normally would buy AC games and/or pay attention to summer game events. It is also releasing about 2 months after the event.

2) AC Red. The main breadwinner for Ubisoft is seeing their first mainline game since 2020 and this time also featuring an updated engine. It will also not be held back by old gen consoles. There is said to be more stealth elements and it takes place in Japan, a setting that has been highly asked for by the AC community. This is also coming later this fall.

3) Finally you have the Splinter Cell remake. Most likely a 2025 game, it is still one of the most anticipated games and will no doubt draw many viewers.

I cannot think of a Ubisoft Forward event that has had so much heavy hitters.

Also aside from the Nintendo summer show which will likely reveale the Switch 2, I cant think of any other summer show that will be as highly anticipated. You have PlayStation but they do not have any major exclusives coming this year so everything shown will be 2025 games. Same with Xbox.",https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/1cg26l9/2024_ubisoft_forward_will_their_biggest_one_yet/,XboxSeriesX
1c767hk,EmergencyTechnical49,2024-04-18 23:29:53,"Shadow of the Tomb Raider is pretty great, actually",109,48,"I remember playing it on release and not being overly impressed. I loved the first one of the reboot trilogy, Rise was fine, but by the time Shadow came out I think I was pretty tired of that formula. Plus I didn't really like the open world and RPG elements, boring filler side quests and large maps full of useless collectibles felt like a step towards The One Ubisoft Style Game that pretty much everyone started to make back then.

I've decided to give it another go on Series X now since it's on Game Pass (I've sold my old physical copy long ago) and with the current gen update and to my huge surprise I'm really loving it.

I feel like time was really kind to this game. Turns out those open world elements now seem really tame in comparison to more modern game design, the game amazingly is very tight in comparison to for example recent Assassin's Creeds. And there are many other great things here. I love that it is not really a shooter in contrast to the previous two. Combat encounters are rare and short. Mostly it's an exploration / puzzle game with lots of clever riddles and fantastic enviroments (do yourself a favor and play on hard, especially for puzzles and exploration, makes for a much more satisfying experience). Tombs are great, it really pays off to go out of your way to find them. There is a lot of hand crafted setpieces and platforming sections with not much in the way of open world bloat actually.

And it looks fantastic to boot! Can't really believe it's a 6 year old game. Again I'm very surprised, but I've spent like 20 hours already this week on this game and I can't get enough. Try it out if you haven't recently!",https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/1c767hk/shadow_of_the_tomb_raider_is_pretty_great_actually/,XboxSeriesX

1c1z1oc,Soft-Illustrator1300,2024-04-12 11:28:19,Halo Infinite should NOT have been Open-World ,325,201,"So a little back story, the very first Halo I played was Reach. Maybe over 10 years ago. Then I played 4 and 5. Eventually I'd get a Series X and go through all the games again on Heroic with the Master Chief collection. Needless to say, I really like the franchise. Then came along the next installment in Halo. 

I finished Halo Infinite two days ago, I know super late to the party. I can't help but to notice how much it feels like a Ubisoft game in its open world. With Chief freeing prisoners, capturing FOBs, collecting upgrade points, etc. I really disliked doing that and I feel like that (the open world) hurt the development of the game. I noticed that the game really did not benefit in any way from having this big open map. There were no big battles, no scarab-like bosses, all the environments looked the same; the map was just there to waste your time. It had a lot of underdeveloped gameplay elements that could have used more time in the oven. 

However, I did enjoy the story for what it was. The last few missions felt like classic Halo to me. I liked the gadgets that were given to Chief, he felt like Batman with his utility belt. I sincerely hope that the next game will have a clearer and more concise vision, for the sake of the franchise. 

If you guys haven't already, go play Infinite's multiplayer, you will not be disappointed.

1bzvsjt,Isunova,2024-04-10 00:01:31,Anybody else just been on a binge of Xbox 360 games instead of modern games?,333,291,"I was about halfway through Alan Wake 2 back in November when life got in the way, and then I started traveling for a few months. Before I knew it, it was April and I forgot everything about the game. I couldn’t be bothered to start it over, so I instead turned to Jedi Survivor. Well, I got bored of that game very quickly. Maybe I just grew out of Star Wars, or maybe I’m just getting bored of gaming in general. So, I figured I’d try some old Xbox 360 games instead. 

Man, I’m hooked. Over the last few weeks that’s basically all I’ve been playing. The Xbox store frequently has really good deals and I picked up Ghost Recon Future Soldier, GRAW 2, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Fable 2, Spec Ops, and I’m replaying the entire Gears of War series from back in the day. 

I’ve also managed to get a handful of Xbox 360 physical copies from garage sales for like $2-3 each and I’m excited to go through them. Batman Arkham Origins is something I’m looking forward to. 

Something about older games is just refreshing. There’s no egregious MTX, no live service crap, and even the older Ubisoft games are free from their now-typical *Ubisoft bloat*. 

It’s great! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/1bzvsjt/anybody_else_just_been_on_a_binge_of_xbox_360/,XboxSeriesX
