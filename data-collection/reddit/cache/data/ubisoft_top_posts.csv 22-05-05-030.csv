China's Tencent is considering buying Ubisoft: both sides are already in talks,"The Guillemot family and Tencent are in talks about a possible buyout of Ubisoft with the aim of turning the French publisher into a private company

A Japanese gamer’s perspective on Assassin’s Creed Shadows,"Yasuke being a legit samurai has never really been proven. Yeah, he pops up in anime now 'cause it looks cool, but growing up, we never learned about him like that.

If the game's gonna be about a real historical figure, it would've made way more sense to go with someone famous, like Miyamoto Musashi, instead of trying to make Yasuke fit the role—especially since we barely know anything about him.

Making Yasuke, who probably wasn’t even a samurai for real, the face of samurai culture kinda feels like it's taking away from Japan's actual history.

That’s why people are saying the game’s guilty of cultural appropriation. It’s rubbed some Japanese and international fans the wrong way. Honestly, if Ubisoft wanted to include Yasuke, they could’ve just had him alongside a well-known Japanese samurai instead of making him the main guy.


What do other Japanese gamers think about this? 

EDIT.1:

Someone made a very interesting point below:

“Yasuke is our first historical protagonist” -ac shadows most recent “showcase” at 2:58

https://youtu.be/IFnLUfEgjYs?si=qhIsSQjhcSm059Ki


EDIT.2:  A common reply I keep seeing is: (BRUH, its just a game, chill)

Asian hate is real and having grown up in the U.S. (teenage years), I personally experienced many challenges related to it. Over the years, I’ve become more capable of defending myself.

However, when I see a French company create a non-Japanese protagonist in a game who is depicted as significantly taller and stronger than the Japanese characters, it feels like they’re promoting a problematic narrative. It comes off as culturally insensitive and tone-deaf.

Normally, I don’t pay much attention to discussions around DEI in gaming, but in this case, the decision feels particularly misguided and could have been handled with more care.",510,1436,OutlawGaming01,1727428529.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fqjl48/a_japanese_gamers_perspective_on_assassins_creed/
"After years of playing Ubisoft games, I gave up on Ubisoft.","I have many Ubisoft games in my catalogue starting from AC black flag. I've played unity, syndicate, origins, Odyssey and Valhalla. Origins being my favorite in the recent Ancient civilization games.

Also played all the watch dogs games. But I can't keep playing Ubisoft games anymore.

Even with heavy discount, they feel like such a chore with the insane grinding. Valhalla broke me, so much grinding and so boring. At one point I stopped having fun and I gave up on the game, WD legion too felt so stale and not fun to play, I finished it but I'll never play it again. WD 2 was so fun.

Now it just feels like Ubisoft is pumping out games just to reach a certain financial goal. They stopped innovating the gameplay and now every single IP feels like same game with a different coat of paint.

Every game has the same stealth mechanic. Every game is monetized our of the ass. Even for AC which is now primarily a RPG series. The fun of RPG is not even present properly, in an RPG I want to feel immersed with various different branches, endings, ways to play which incentives multiple play throughs but after finishing an AC game I feel drained and don't want to play it again. It doesn't give me any reason for me to play again.

Where as CDPR even cyberpunk, I would play again, with different endings, different builds, different relationships. At the very least because the gameplay loop is engaging, I don't have to grind for hours. Same for the witcher, even though they are 2 different IPs and both being RPGs, they are different experiences. The DLC expands and innovates on the base game too.

Sucker Punch has very diverse IPs from Sly cooper which is a platformer stealth to infamous which is a pure open world power fantasy to the Ghost series.

In conclusion, I'm done with Ubisoft now until I see a actual effort to innovate in their games.

P.S. Imo since Origins came out, the AAA games quality bar has reached so high to where Ubisoft simply can't compete anymore. We have bangers every year like elden ring, God of War, Baldur's Gate, RDR 2, Alan Wake and all these games take time to cook, meanwhile Ubisoft out here pumping out new AC games on a pretty much yearly basis with same old formula like a making new iPhones with minimal new upgrades borrowed from other games but doesn't improve on it and I don't think Ubisoft understands why the games I mentioned and the features they borrow from other games were actually so popular and hits with the gamers.",362,237,rudra285,1727637660.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fscd1h/after_years_of_playing_ubisoft_games_i_gave_up_on/
"From Loyal Fan to Loyal Hater, The Gamers Perspective ","I grew up playing Ubisoft games when I got my first Xbox 360. Assassins Creed,Division, Splinter Cell, Far Cry, Rainbow, and Ghost Recon. Splinter Cell has been off the radar since 2014 (Blacklist came 2013). Siege is almost 10 years old. Division only has 2 games and honestly we have the most stable online community in the games in my opinion. Then Heartlands got canceled. And now we're waiting on 3. Still. Far Cry and Assassins Creed fall ill to the same things. ""We"" didn't want level systems and ""looter shooters"". And the story got stale and gameplay repetitive.  Far Cry plots starting at 3: Pirates vs Natives and MC, Dictatorship vs rebels, Cult vs rebels, Dictatorship vs rebels. Ghost Recon Breakpoint came in 2019. It's a great game except it feels repetitive but still fun. I don't know, it feels like Assassins Creed isn't even Assassins Creed anymore. Ghost Recon and Div are barely holding on it seems like. Please listen to your fan base. Whats left of it I guess. Ubisoft is a cornerstone to my gaming childhood. I don't want people to fail or people to lose jobs. But I'm also not gonna support and defend a company that's slowly destroying what I loved. But that's my personal opinion on this.

Second strike at Ubisoft is approaching,"As of today, October 14, 2024, Ubisoft workers in France are preparing for a significant strike. This action stems from their frustration over Ubisoft’s new return-to-office policy, which mandates employees to be in the office at least three days a week. The French video game workers' union, Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV), is calling on Ubisoft's French employees to join the strike from October 15 to October 17, 2024.

The strike reflects growing discontent among employees, particularly following Ubisoft’s announcement of a hybrid work model that workers feel imposes unnecessary hardship. This tension comes in the midst of other challenges Ubisoft faces, including poor game performance and management decisions that have already upset employees and parts of the player base.

This protest could be a turning point for Ubisoft as it tries to navigate internal dissatisfaction while tackling broader industry pressures.

Ubisoft Is Reportedly Planning To Release 10 Assassin's Creed Games In Five Years,"When the news broke out that Assassin's Creed: Shadows was being delayed, it was met with mixed reactions. Personally, I see it as a good thing, as it gives the development team more time to iron out the bugs that are too often found in Ubisoft releases; it seems that Vaas Montenegro sat down with the executives and told them the definition of insanity... Or so I thought. 

Now it appears that Ubisoft is planning on speed running Assassin's Creed fatigue; instead of taking 5 years to develop one game, they're gonna be releasing 10 AC games in 5 years. 

Despite Assassin's Creed probably being my favorite videogame franchise ever since the first game, and having played every mainline AC game up until Odyssey, and having Valhalla in my library, I decided to take a break, as I had spent over 200+ hours playing Odyssey, and despite thoroughly enjoying the totality of the game and its various DLC's, it was exhausting enough that I haven't even gotten off the island of Kephallonia in New Game+. Ironically/coincidentally, I'm currently playing The Division; another Ubisoft title. 

As much as I love the franchise, I don't see how over-milking the AC franchise is a good idea. Each of the Assassin's Creed games have faltered in several facets that could have been improved had they stayed in development for a little while longer, but Ubisoft seems perfectly content with ""good enough""... Now their future as a videogame publisher is uncertain, with talks of a buyout by another multimedia conglomerate.  

Could this be the final nail on the coffin for Ubisoft, or could this actually be what it takes to regain their foothold as an industry giant and reclaim their status as a beloved videogame publisher? I think at this point, nothing Ubisoft does will sway some gamers who are dead set in their disdain for the company, but what do y'all think about Ubisoft's plans to release 10 Assassin's Creed games in the span of 5 years?

Petition: Require videogame publishers to keep games they have sold in a working state,"""People seem to think that people who support this do not understand development or are asking too much. That isn't the case. They are not asking for a game to remain forever online, but rather be made to work after end of service. This would be the easiest to accomplish for single player games (or non-shared world multiplayer games) where the requirement to talk to the server just needs to be removed, and a P2P system could be implemented for the multiplayer elements. For multiplayer games that use a shared world the ability for home ran servers would need to be implemented or at the very least allow players to play by themselves (not ideal, but with this modders would eventually get it to a better state).

If this is enacted, then going forward companies would be able to keep in mind that their games would still need to function after EoS. So, future games would be able to plan a EoS solution. This may also influence development and push some games that don't need a shared world server to just use a P2P solution.""",99,54,PoohTrailSnailCooch,1713295947.0,https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/659071/

"Oh look, XDefiant has zero Caucasian male operators, what a surprise","What a shocker it is that's no white male operators exist in the game. Of course you have every other box that can be checked.

 Asian male? Check. 
Black female? Check.
 Overbearing and annoying Hispanic announcer? Check.
Etc....

It's funny too because there's no doubt whatsoever that the people who will be playing this game more than other demographics will certainly be white men. Why do video game companies do this? Media in general has really been getting Caucasian men the middle finger. Every other group gets more than their fair share of representation but God forbid white men are also included despite making up a bigger portion of the population then any other group of men. It just doesn't make sense if for no other reason than we all know white men are going to be playing this the most so why go out of the way to exclude them? 

It's intentional, don't act like it's not. If it doesn't bother you that's fine it doesn't actually really bother me too much but I'm just annoyed that they go out of their way to exclude any group of people... let alone their biggest player base demographic.

Ubisoft gonna Ubisoft,"I posted a few weeks ago about how Ubisoft stock performance over the last few years had plummeted. I stated it was on account of management incompetence and how investors were losing confidence just as fast as gamers. 

Some chimed in about how pissing off gamers doesn’t affect the stock price… and while this is true from a direct sense if we don’t buy Ubisoft crap then they don’t meet their targets and investors divest. 

Ubisoft management exudes a degree of incompetence that offends common sense and oppresses the skilled workforce they possess across their various studios. 

Well- they missed targets and abandoned all gains they’d enjoyed over the last couple months. Further evidence that the current leadership team straight up to the CEO is incompetent.

Ubisoft make me sad,"The obligatory thing to say is that I am not a hater, and I own so many Ubisoft games from their major franchise (AC, Ghost Recon, Far Cry, watchdogs, Prince of Persia, The Crew, The Division...)

In the last few years, you have noticed a drop in the gameplay quality of their games. I have a tolerance for long games if they are well-made. I truly enjoyed AC: odyssey and considered it as one of my favorite Ubisoft games (AC: odyssey should have been the start of another separate franchise that focuses more on mythology-based RPG and not an assassin game), i liked Ghost Recon Wildlands and Breakpoint (after the patches). I enjoyed Far Cry 6 and the division series.

Ubisoft art direction and environmental artists are truly some of the best in the industry and capable of releasing amazing-looking games that run well year after year. The cities they create feel very authentic.

Ubisoft also has good gameplay systems, from how the weapons feel and perform, to how the combat flows, to the additional tools they give you to take several scenarios. to usually decent progression system that let you feel more powerful at times goes on

The stories they tell aren't bad, but aren't great either, almost every Ubisoft game follows the same formula, a starting locked-off area that teaches you game mechanics, then three (or more) independent separate areas with separate stories and characters that you can take in any order, and then a final confrontation.

If I have to summarize what makes games turn away from Ubisoft games are constant small frustrations that eventually add up to makes the game feels like a chore to play. Let’s give you some examples.

you can take a look at Far Cry 6 with repeated quest design, and removal of leveling up perks instead of sticking them to clothing pieces each scattered on a different part of the map behind puzzles or enemy camps. Or the not-present main villain, or the fact best gear is hidden behind a paywall.

Almost every Ubisoft game's best weapons and abilities are hidden behind a paywall. Their games are built around frustrating/edging you enough to shell out extra in-game monetization for a game that you already paid for. I am here wondering how much extra money are they making in these MTX console/PC games ? 

Every Ubisoft game must have a merchant that doesn’t take the regular currency, but only takes a premium currency that either has to grind for an unreasonably long time with random weekly reward.

Or selling a complete edition or ultimate edition of the game that doesn’t contain all the content, and you expected to fork extra money on that.

Not to mention the online requirements for single-player games, live services for most Ubi games and finally removing content from your library that you paid for.

All these frustrations add up to gamers automatically feeling like they are about to get screwed because Ubisoft has done so repeatedly in the past.

Some Ubisoft games feel off is that in most cases gameplay systems don't work well together.

In LoZ:Botw almost every upgrade is behind a temple puzzle, but these puzzles are diverse enough with a separate theme that allows challenge your problem-solving skills, different combat skills, timing skills, or creativity and the game gives you all the tools to do that early on.  AC: Valhalla obviously tries to copy the idea of a puzzle behind weapon and upgrade but you end up with a badly designed puzzle that is either not properly introduced, or just looking around to find an opening from an angle to shoot a lock so you can enter a door to shoot another lock to get to a lame rewards (ingots). And the best/coolest rewards (weapons/armors) are hidden behind a paywall. What makes matters worse is that you will spend more time than you like just to find the angle from where you want to shoot because of the game's dense geometry and the art style. Or the never-ending skill tree that is filled with +1% damage while (random action)…. It just feels disrespectful of your time. Even Immortal: fenyx rising suffers from a similar puzzle design but to a slightly lesser degree. These games just feel constantly frustrating you so go and buy ingots from the store using real world money

Or stealth section in star wars outlaws where you don’t have any stealth tools and broken line of sight system.

Or shallow characters and repetitive missions in every Ubisoft game that the writers of the game think they are amazing and cool.

And this makes me sad. Most Ubisoft games aren’t bad, they are a company that targets a 7/10 or 8/10 game that hasn’t released anything a real GOTY in the last decade. It feels like maybe if they spend more time polishing the gameplay systems, better writing,  and better quest design they can end up with solid games every time because you can see the potential. Ubisoft feels like the smart kid in highschool class, who is set to do the bare minimum to get a passing grading that you know can ace the exam if they make the effort, but after a long time doing these, you started wondering if that can even recover because of their bad habits. That is why their games always go on sale soon after launch because no one wants to pay the full price for a game they have played before with a different skin on top, especially when you know another one in releasing in few month that will end up a similar experience. The best way to enjoy a Ubisoft game is to take a long break between their franchise and that what I think instinctively we are doing as gamers.

Ubisoft Shares Slump After Investor Urges Assassin’s Creed Maker to Go Private,"Shares of [Ubisoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FR/UBI?mod=ANLink) Entertainment plunged Monday after a minority investor called for the maker of the Assassin’s Creed videogame franchise to go private and install a new management team.

AJ Investments, a hedge fund based in Slovakia that holds less than 1% in Ubisoft, said in a letter to management that it was unsatisfied with the current performance and strategic direction of the company.

Ubisoft has been facing a number of setbacks in recent months. It no longer expects to release “Rainbow Six Mobile” and “The Division Resurgence” in the fiscal year ending in March 2025, saying in July that developers needed extra time to ensure the games meet players’ expectations.

The delays came after the group ceased development of “The Division Heartland,” a decision it made to redeploy resources to bigger releases such as “XDefiant.” Its share price has tumbled more than 50% over the last 12 months. Shares in Paris were down more than 9% on Monday after AJ Investments published its letter to Ubisoft management.

Juraj Krupa, founder and chief executive of AJ Investments, said he wanted the letter to be a wake-up call for other investors. The hedge fund said Ubisoft should go private and urged the founding Guillemot family not to block a sale process. It also called for the installment of a new chief executive willing to weigh the sale of some studios and lay off staff to cut costs.

Ubisoft didn’t respond to a request for comment on the letter.

Since Ubisoft doesn’t offer you to do it yourself, you HAVE to contact them and ask them to do it for you. How can such a simple task be stretched to over A MONTH. Ubisoft, your support is pathetic. I wouldn’t even call it support since you aren’t helping, at all. I can’t call since you don’t have a hotline in my country, all I can do is submit cases and just wait. For weeks. And months.

Absolutely disgusting pricing model for Star Wars Outlaws.,"This is now the second Ubisoft title in a row doing this exact same pricing model, they did the exact same thing with Avatar Frontiers of Pandora. Deliberately cranking the price up of each edition of the game exponentially to force people into their dog water subscription service. Not only that but the game isn't even available on Steam, because Ubisoft the multi-billion dollar organisation doesn't want to pay any fees to be on the Steam store   


I was so excited for Avatar until I saw it wasn't on Steam, but still I though maybe ill try it regardless. Then I got to the store page and saw the prices and thought nope I'll never be playing that game.   
It's going to be the exact same for this game too I wont ever touch it. I don't understand how it's possible for a company to be so out of touch $130 dollars for a video game.   


This is why people pirate games. You're games keep getting worse and the prices keep going up. When will you realise that. The to make things worse you don't put your games on the most popular store front on the PC platform to avoid fees. The worst part is people will defend this aggressive price gouging, because people swear blind allegiances to faceless corporations who don't even care of their existence and defend them to the ends of the earth it so weird.   


I was so excited for this but I can whole heartedly say I will not be buying this game or any Ubisoft title in the foreseeable future your company is sickening.   


• Sort your pricing model out   
• Stop pushing (forcing via method above) people into buying your subscription service  
• Stop locking all your games behind Ubisoft Connect as if its some cool hip place to play games. It's not, nobody want's their games on Ubisoft Connect. ",41,117,brettapuss,1712754572.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1c0l71b/absolutely_disgusting_pricing_model_for_star_wars/

"Can't submit a refund request, can't submit a support ticket, literally trapped with a purchase. how is Ubisoft a AAA game company?","Yesterday I bought AC origins thru the Connect PC app. I decided I want to get the gold version since it's on sale and I want the DLC, and since I'm under 2hrs of playtime and I'm giving them more money I naively figured a refund would be no problem. But the game is not in my online account at ALL, it only shows up on the connect app, where I see no option to submit a refund request. 

So I go to their support page, and I get an infinite loading animation when I click ""contact us"" (multiple devices, gigabit ethernet, not my browser or connection). Am I the only one who gets this infinite loading thing when trying to reach out to them...?

I don't mean for this to devolve into a rant but how can a AAA game studio operate like this? Where is the after-sales service and general QA for the Connect app...?

"Anyone who thinks ""removing CREW"" from players' lobby is okay, needs to read this =>","I saw many people are advocating that -

- ""its just the industry"" ,  

- ""it was gonna happen someday anyway"" , 

- ""read the t&c""


What you are failing to understand is -> this problem had a solution right in front of their eyes.

""THE CREW"" is online-only game but this game still had races you could play with Ai, what they could have done is -> they should have rolled out an ""offline patch"" to just let owners play the game forever.

Ubisoft probably pulled the game from store because of expired vehicle license but there was no reason to take it away from users especially when they sold games to play even 1 month or even 1 day before server shutdown. Selling a product with 1 day of validity, now that's robbery.

Also, getting away with t&c and not taking effort to allow players to play their games offline will make them confident to remove more games ahead just because they can force you into buying their new games (that's the real motive behind all this fiasco and everyone knows it).

Hell, I can't even play motorfest anytime their servers take a hiccup or have some issues and it will also be removed after few years.

CREW is not the type of franchise depending on player capacity like csgo, valorant, PUBG -> this franchise has single-player factor too and that's need to stay alive.

I have not changed my country or anything else on my account recently.  I logged in to my account via the Ubisoft website and looked at my account details and it does not appear that anything has changed.  There are no unrecognized devices either.

  
I looked at the Terms of Use and it looks like the last time they updated was in 2020.  The privacy policy was updated in 2023.  I thought perhaps they had new terms and the verbiage of the pop-up was just incorrect but that doesn't seem to be the case.

"Just spent 4 days with Ubisoft support trying to access games that were purchased in the uplay days, but that were successfully merged to a new Ubisoft connect account over a year ago, only to be stonewalled because I suggested that at this point it might be a legal issue.","Sorry for the long title, and this is going to be a venting type post because I’m beyond frustrated. 

So I contacted Ubisoft 4 days ago because when I tried to launch my game library through GFN(GeForce Now) I got a Ubisoft connect DRM authentication error. It took them 56 hours to initially respond, then they bounced through 25 different agents in 9 hours, MADE ME MAKE A NEW EMAIL ACCOUNT, A NEW UBISOFT CONNECT ACOUNT, AUTHENTICATED ONLY ONE OF 6 GAMES I REQUESTED AFTER ASKING FOR THE EXACT SAME PROOF OF PURCHASE PHOTO 9 TIMES(which wasn’t even for the original game I asked for), SEPARATED MY GAME LIBRARY BETWEEN TWO ACCOUNTS, THEN SUPPORT DELETED THE BRAND NEW ACOUNT THEY FORCED ME TO MAKE. 

After all of that they still  failed to resolve issue, and then  they stonewalled me because I suggested at this point I’d probably just end up making a complaint with the FTC(an excellent resource if you have transactional issues with businesses), that I’d possibly speak with someone about getting refunds for my entire catalog through the respective markets, and speak to someone in the Ubisoft legal department, because I’ve spent a considerable amount on my Ubisoft Catalog, and they’ve wasted a lot of my time. Now none of my games work, including newer purchases for the ghost series which were made directly through the Ubisoft connect account I merged with when uplay shut down.

And even more confusingly, all of my games are shown as owned under my main account, including keys, and I played them all only a few months ago the last time I was subscribed to GFN.

When did Ubisoft fall off a cliff? Or was it a gradual decline?,"I’ve been a fan of Ubisoft for years, but it’s clear something went very wrong along the way. I’m curious, when exactly did Ubisoft fall off for you? Was it gradual or did they jump the shark at one particular moment?

For me, Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag was their last true high point. The naval combat was fantastic, and it felt like they had so much potential. But look at what they’ve turned out recently. Star Wars Outlaws is embarrassingly mediocre for a franchise with limitless possibilities, and Skull and Bones is just a shadow of what Black Flag achieved years ago. It’s like they completely lost sight of what made their games special.

Maybe it was with Assassin’s Creed Unity and its buggy launch, or was the writing was on the wall with the Watch Dogs series not quite delivering on its promises?

The way I see it, the rot has fully set in at Ubisoft, and honestly, I don’t see them recovering anytime soon. Unless some Elon Musk-type figure steps in, fires the execs and all these managers obsessed with squeezing every last penny out of us with microtransactions, and brings in developers who actually love making games, not just monetising them, it’s hard to see a way out. The culture need to be completely overhauled.

When exactly did their priorities shifted entirely to cranking out cookie-cutter open-world games and pushing live-service models, instead of focusing on creativity and gameplay innovation?

Beyond the Skin Deep: a short essay on cultural colonialism and Asian male exclusion,"The excitement surrounding a new Assassin's Creed title can quickly turn to disappointment when it reinforces harmful tropes. Assassin's Creed Shadows presents a problematic case of cultural appropriation and neo-colonial fantasy.

I’ve been a fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise; however, I couldn't help but feel silenced and suppressed when I saw the trailer. I’m sure many share this frustration.That being said, I’ve seen little argument on the internet that represents the asian community. 

The core issue lies in prioritising a superficial diversity as a metric of cultural authenticity. However, it’s not difficult to see that the insertion is wrong on many levels. 

Firstly, demoting and excluding Asian male characters in a setting steeped in Asian culture is a missed opportunity. Rich historical periods abound in Asia, offering a chance to explore diverse Asian cultures through the lens of an Asian protagonist. Sengoku period boasts a vibrant tapestry of history, brimming with potential for an Asian protagonist's journey. 

Tales of countless Japanese samurai have been passed down through the ages. Shunting them aside in favour of a character from a different ethnicity undermines the very cultural immersion the game strives for. Subsequently, this so-called cultural product has been reduced to a mere puppet show.

Western media, including video games, has a poor track record of portraying Asian men as strong, masculine and heroic figures. They're often demoted to comedic sidekicks or one-dimensional villains.  Assassin's Creed's decision to seemingly bypass an Asian male samurai protagonist in a Japanese setting is an intentional mistake, and some might see it as a cynical ploy for ""diversity points"", under the guise of cultural exchange.

Having to insert an African man as a figure of diversity, while losing touch with the context of Asian cultural backgrounds is a form of ignorant racism by itself. It suggests that there’s not enough racial diversity on the continent. Especially when it comes to **Celebrating diversity within Asia, few seem to care** enough to populate fictional worlds with characters from various Asian ethnicities.

Naoe’s character does serve the purpose of Asian representation. No one talks about Naoe because she has been accepted as a character the moment she was revealed. Similar to how Asian women are easily accepted as the norm and “part of the group,” while Asian men are marginalised and viewed as an outsider to the group. It is not real inclusion/representation until Asian men are positively accepted in mainstream western media. 

Secondly, depicting a black character as the central figure enacting over-glorified violence in a Japanese setting is insensitive and potentially reinforces a cultural **neo-colonial** narrative demoting and excluding Asian men. Whether it's historically accurate is besides the point, although it remains questionable, forcing a character of colour into a role that perpetuates negative stereotypes is disrespectful, to both Asians and Africans. 

There is enough cultural background for a game to be set in Africa,so I can't help but question whether it's really about diversity and minority representation. Forcing a black character in Japanese culture shows **the lack of confidence the studio has** in selling African cultural heritage in pop art products. Just to entertain the thought, a game set in Ethiopia would have existed if they wanted it to, since the historical and cultural landscape is just as rich and vibrant.

Assassins creed producer's racist comment ""First of all, we wanted ""our samurai"", that is, someone who could be our eyes, who is not Japanese...""undoubtedly implies that there's a difference between ""our samurai"" and a ""real"" samurai. This arrogant and pretentious attitude confirms a desire for a character who fulfils a stereotypical role rather than someone with genuine cultural background. Besides, it reinforces the idea of ""otherness."" The statement diminishes the legitimacy of Japanese people to portray their own culture. Finally, the desire for ""the Western Perspective"" implies a lack of trust or understanding of Japanese culture. A good story can be told from within a culture.

It all boils down to the hidden proactive race war mentality. Following this logic, it’s morally challenging for western media to respect and praise the threatening enemy race highly, especially when the said race has a big chance of replacing and removing their own race/society/civilization from the ruling throne in future. (Especially the male population who may become combat soldiers that engage in the anticipated physical conflict in future.)

Assassin's Creed Shadows has the potential to be an immersive experience, but it should strive for cultural sensitivity. By featuring authentic Asian heroes and delving deeper into the chosen historical period, the game can avoid accusations of appropriation and create a narrative that's both respectful and engaging for a global audience.

What The Crew meant to me.,"The Crew was an x-box 360 game that me and my brother had. He is autistic and would shut down if I tried to play with him. But if we played video games I could play without him shutting down. So I would spend all the time I could on our x-box's just playing and bantering. It didn't matter the game, Minecraft, The Crew, Lego star wars, Test-drive EVE of destruction. With The Crew being shut down it feels like a chunk of my childhood is just gone. Plus as me and my brother grew up he started introverting harder, so I miss him even though he's right there. It feels like he was last online 6 years ago.

Also the audio comes and goes and my character has delayed voice lines that come up in the most random places ever. The cinematics take like 1 min to be triggered and sometimes they repeat. the list goes on.....

\-I have all the pc requirements 

\-updated drives and networks

\-no other app runs while I play

\-I switch graphics and settings to see a difference and I don't see any change....

pls help :(",26,211,smol_tedy,1702008949.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/18deehh/avatar_frontiers_of_pandora_not_working_as/
Should Ubisoft go private?,"It’s hard to deny that the company is in a bit of trouble right now, stock prices that are only falling, accepting defeat on epic games and ubisoft connect, pulling from Tokyo game show, investors pushing for mass layoffs and removal of its CEO, flop after flop with their only win this year being a 71 on metacritic (prince of Persia).

Should Ubisoft go private, it would mean the only people that they would need to worry about is themselves, without having as an aggressive profit driven path to lead them to a possibly brighter future?

What are your guys thoughts on this idea?

Assassin's Creed needs to slow down and innovate,"A lot of people has criticized the latest installment for historical inaccuracies or whatever, but honestly, the main issues that there have been 13 main assassin's creed games.

THIRTEEN!

That's insane, and most of them are so similar, they might as well be just one game with many DLC campaigns.

The first one was novel and interesting - travelling back in time through your genetic memory, doing parkour on top of buildings, sneaking around. They made you actually have fun and feel like an assassin.

As cool as the idea is however, it has been milked so much they need to change the formula.

If instead of trying to release a reskin every year or so, it would be way batter if they take their time and make something more novel and work on it for a longer period of time. If they want their ""Elden Ring moment"" sort of speak, they should put the same amount of time behind a title.

I mean to a new player the sense of novelty might still be there, but for people who have been fans of the franchise for a long time, just changing the time period gets sooo stale.

A company as large and as resourceful as Ubi can surely afford innovative game designers who can come up with something novel that can wow us, right?

I mean if they release something that gives you the same sense of coolness and novelty as the earlier titles, I am sure people would gladly pay the AAA game price and praise the game.

At the top of my head, with the improvements of technology and hardware performance, they could add cooler stuff like fully destructible and/or flammable environments, dynamic settlements that change over time, NPCs and groups of NPCs that you build interpersonal relationships with, even building long-term enemies, advanced damage models where you target parts of their bodies and inflict realistic wounds and injuries, etc. The possibilities are endless.

Former member of Ubisoft Support here. Support questions welcome! AMA,"Hey there folks,

Yes, you read correctly. I used to be a member of Ubisoft Support for almost 2 years.

Since Ubisoft Support has hit a pretty big low over the last year, I thought it'd be useful to create this post.

Many of you may have seen me being pretty active on this subreddit, and some of you have messaged me on my DMs to ask me questions. A lot of the posts I have seen, seem to ask the same exact questions everyday. So I thought it would be good for me to create this post, where I can answer some of them. Due to my time in support, I do have a lot of expertise that I think would be useful to share. I have seen other users who have also stated they used to work for them that have also shared their own knowledge to help you folks out.

Here are a few ground rules:

1. Keep in mind, THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL UBISOFT SUPPORT THREAD. I have no way of recovering your account, changing your email, or directly resolving your issue. I will simply be acting as a sort of advisor, that can save you some time while you wait for a response on your support ticket. I am also NOT REPRESENTING UBISOFT in any sort of fashion.
2. Let's try to keep a good tone with no foul language. I will not be responding to questions that ask ""Why is Ubisoft so shit? hurr durr"". Those types of people will be blocked. Regular questions, especially those related to support issues, will be welcome.
3. I am making this post as a hobby and to help out. I won't be monitoring it 24/7 so if I sometimes provide you with a delayed response, that's because life was calling. It may still be faster than Support's response though.
4. Since Ubisoft Support's guidelines are subject to change, and it's been a while since my time there, some of the things I tell you may not have 100% accuracy. Especially, when it comes to account recovery. But as far as I have seen other posts, around 95% of the rules are still the same.
5. If some questions do repeat, you may see me copying the same answers for duplicates. I don't always have the time to manually write a detailed and personalized answer to everyone, so this keeps it simple for me, while also giving you as much info as possible. It's nothing personal.

On the 3rd note, I have come across other users who also have worked for Ubisoft Support and have the same type of expertise, maybe even more than me. So if they see this and want to join in and answer some questions, they are free to do so.

You could also message me on chat, but I don't really look at my DMs often, so I may respond in an even less timely manner if I'm busy.

Without further a do, feel free to ask anything on your mind. If this post can be pinned for others to see, it would be great.",17,156,Proud-Host-3932,1709760721.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1b8bwbd/former_member_of_ubisoft_support_here_support/

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is an overlooked gem!,"Despite being a fan of the Avatar movies and the Far Cry games, I never really paid much attention to this game before and after its release. Ubisoft's own marketing for it seemed rather subdued too, probably because they were too busy hyping up AC Mirage for most of 2023, and then moved on to Outlaws after that.

But I decided to give the 5-hour trial a go on PS5 and I'm glad I did. It might be a bit disingenuous to describe it as a reskinned Far Cry Primal, but FCP is one of my favorites in the FC series, and it's a good hook on which to hang an Avatar-themed game. 

The opening few hours of the game (essentially the tutorial phase) are a bit uneven, so my advice is to play at least as far as the point where you meet the clan at the big tree (which is when the trial ends anyway), which is around the 2-3 hour mark. After you do the hunting quest for them you're pretty much done with the tutorial phase and the game really opens up to leave you to your own devices.

The level design of the first area on Pandora is a bit awkward. It tries to funnel you towards very specific places but doesn't do a good job explaining exactly where those areas are, so there will be a fair bit of running into natural boundaries and/or labyrinthine platform jumping. Making sure you're in Guided mode is pretty much essential for those first few hours. Yeah, I normally dislike Guided in the AC games and prefer Exploration, but trust me, you'll want to be in Guided until you reach the big ass tree, at which point turn Exploration mode back on and go have yourself some fun.

Thankfully, that's the most awkward the game has been. After that, it's Far Cry Primal shenanigans all the way.",18,6,retroblique,1722120802.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1edsyow/avatar_frontiers_of_pandora_is_an_overlooked_gem/

Ubisoft possibly the worst company in the world for customer support,"I am getting to the end of my tether with Ubisoft support I don't think I've experienced worse customer service in my life.

I bought Motorfest back in Novemeber through Epic Store and went to install it for which I needed sign in to Ubisoft. I go ahead and sign in to be told there's an error. Fast forward to just before Christmas with a lot of back and forth, investigating and waiting it turns out my Ubisoft account was once connected to another Epic account (my old one from several years ago I no longer have access to and don't use) which I found odd because I don't ever recall buying a Ubisoft game before through Epic and they tell me I need to re-connect the Ubisoft account to that old Epic account.

Anyway last week after a break for Christmas and New Year I re-open my case and explain the situation about old the Epic account etc and they respond (unusually) within a couple hours however they have misunderstood my respone and think I have 2 Ubisoft accounts so send me a code to to move the support ticket to another Ubisoft account.

Obviously, I couldn't use the old card, so during the payment process, I selected the option to add a new one, filled out the necessary information, accepted, and completed the purchase. Unfortunately, after that, Ubisoft somehow decided to use the old card saved on the account, which no longer works, instead of the new one I provided. This led to my subscription being suspended, and my immediate attempt to change the payment method to the new one made no difference, as it isn’t processed right away.

"Could Ubisoft go bankrupt (if at worst case scenario, AC Shadows flops)? And what is next for Assassin's Creed if they have to sell their IP to stay afloat?","Lately, there's been a lot of chatter about Ubisoft's financial struggles, and I can't help but feel worried about the future of one of my all-time favorite franchises: Assassin's Creed. I've been a fan since the very first game, and over the years, I've loved exploring the historical settings, mastering the art of parkour, and diving into the complex lore. From Altaïr to Ezio, and from Connor to Eivor, the journey has been nothing short of amazing. Assassin's Creed has been more than just a game series to me; it’s an immersive experience that I've grown deeply attached to.

So, you can imagine how disheartening it is to think that Ubisoft could potentially go bankrupt. If it comes down to that, the possibility of Assassin's Creed being sold off is both a scary and intriguing thought. On one hand, it could mean the end of the series as we know it, but on the other hand, it might also present an opportunity for the franchise to evolve under new leadership.

If it ever comes to that, the big question is: Which game studio would be best suited to take the reins of the Assassin's Creed franchise? I personally think Panache Studio should take charge of AC.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. Which game studio do you think could handle Assassin's Creed the best? And, as a fellow fan, how would you feel about someone else taking over the series?",17,177,PseudoMinded,1726225253.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1ffrwkk/could_ubisoft_go_bankrupt_if_at_worst_case/

My thoughts on the current Ubisoft controversy,"Video games that are single player should be kept in a working state even once it’s taken off the store. Ubisoft recently have removed the crew from peoples library’s. Even people who brought the game physics are unable to play. I understand that if I buy a game digitally that it can be taken off my library at any time but this should not be the case with physically purchased games. Otherwise what’s the point in physical copies of games?

If studios insist that games are a service and not a product then it should be clearly labeled on the box, like how the age rating of the game is. Gaming is a hobby that a lot of children are into. It’s ethically wrong to expect a child to expect to understand that they do not actually own the game which they have been lead to believe is a product they would own forever. I’m proposing that either developers are obligated to keep the game in a working state, or that like with age ratings, it’s clearly stated on the box that you are paying for a temporary license and do not own the game you have purchased.",15,18,,1713971484.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1cc0og6/my_thoughts_on_the_current_ubisoft_controversy/
"Please, for the love of god, separate older titles you no longer support from the launcher.

I’m already logged in, I have my login saved so I don’t have to keep re-logging back in, *there is literally no reason for you to keep pushing this crap onto players, especially when it’s a game you haven’t supported in years.*

Ubisoft really need to do something here, for older games especially it’s not very pro-consumer. I don’t want to have to open up and login to another launcher for a game that is no longer supported. I just want to play the damn game.

The game runs amazingly on the deck, but it’s a shame to see older titles be plagued with dumb crap like this. The Deck has made handheld gaming feel, honestly, amazing! But 3rd party launchers for games you’ve purchased *on steam* adds a roadblock to that otherwise seamless experience. Please, consider seperating your older, unsupported titles from the launcher, or at least stop this logging in every time you launch an old title thing, it’s so abhorrently infuriating.

"Error Code 0-0x00000001 in R6 and ""Updating Security Measures"" is completely broken and there is no fix to be found"," 

Just like the title says I'm not sure why there hasn't been a solid solution/fix to having this error code come up when you launch R6.. I've been trying to fix this for OVER TWO DAYS NOW and I don't see and end to this never ending battle. When you lookup this error code on the internet all you find is a bunch of THREADS GOING BACK TO 2021 asking how to fix this problem with no fix in sight

Some people seemingly get this fixed within minutes with no explanation while others like me are sitting in purgatory hell again waiting.. I enjoy playing Rainbow 6 but I don't enjoy Ubisoft or their monkey brain Battleye software. I've scoured every thread on the internet looking for a fix for this and STILL no answers are to be found

It also doesn't help that when ""updating security measures"" fails instead of being able to retry it back to back you have to wait a certain number of seconds before it will even let you retry to ""update"" it again.. At first its 10 seconds and then 20, 70, 120, 350, 750, 950 and then it resets.. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO COMPOUND HOW LONG I WAIT IN-BETWEEN RETRYING AN UPDATE!?!?!? It wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to manually click the retry button every time!! But now trying to fix this for basically the third day now Ive waited over 5 hours in the in-game menu letting this timer spin around multiple times just so I can retry this supposed update when this is all just rooted to Error Code 0-0x00000001... This is the kind of stuff that makes me dislike Ubisoft as a company, I enjoy their games but I cant stand their un-userfriendly practices and are unwilling to fix these silly issues that have been an issue for YEARS and have been a result in countless posts.

Ubisoft thinks sending their copy-paste troubleshooting guide works but I would like some actual answers when Ubisoft themselves cant even tell us a fix! All they have to say about the subject is this:

""Error Code 0-0x00001001 in Rainbow Six: Siege

Ubisoft Launcher doesn't work. Can't launch any game. Their servers are down for 3 days straight now in South Asia.,"For almost 3 days now, I can't launch any Ubisoft game. Their launcher keeps saying unable to connect with server - ALL their games are server dependent. So, NONE of their games work in ASIA servers. There have no support system - No response to emails, no chat system. When I try msg them on X, a bunch of bot accounts ask me to surrender sensitive information to a random ""tech support"" accounts on IG. This seems like a multi-targeted attack on them or they themselves are perpetrating right now. 

When I tried to login - I'm getting some weird scam message in OTP verification that says - Frankly Cash App OTP or some other random text. Something is deeply off putting with their services here. I tried to uninstall their launcher and reinstall it - but their launcher doesn't download from their own website. 

At this point, I don't have a choice but to refund all their games I own on steam and thank god I only bought em on steam, coz otherwise I know I'll never get a refund back.

Not even a year after, they announced AC: Shadows few days ago, and it's going to be released later this year. In the meantime they somehow launched Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Skull and Bones. I know Ubisoft is billion dollar publisher with multiple studios. To be fair, Bethesda also has multiple studios and backed by Microsoft. Rockstar also has huge amount devs. Most of other well-known publishers are billion dollar corporations.

What does Ubisoft has different compared to other companies in that level and how are they keeping consistency with multiple franchises",16,82,avjayarathne,1716124561.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1cvo1vb/how_ubisoft_makes_aaa_games_consecutively_while/
I just might be done with Ubi ,"I’ve defended Ubi throughout the years, holding in to hope that they would keep some consistency up. 

Ghost recon wildlands lost support despite being one of a kind shooter with a loyal pvp fanbase… I moved on..

The siege activism started and I was a bit upset but the game retained some fun so I kept at it. 

GR breakpoint released a buggy mess and I stayed until the blatant cheaters on pvp drove me away. 

Division 2 my favorite shooter for years was the one constant I had until they added the proficiency BS and I hate it.. I already had over 2000 hours and all the godroll items I could ever possibly have, but what was the new content? Just spend hours upon hours farming xp and resources to get proficiency and individually level up each item with hundreds of resources, fun!! Story is still amazing but that killed it for me.. I go back to unlock new content but I don’t play after… you killed it with the meaningless/boring grind.

Far Cry 6 was the last of us 2 of far cry, what a crappy story… might have the best combat in the series but the story is garbage tier, never had I skipped cutscenes in a far cry like I did in 6 I truly got annoyed at the characters… specially the cringe inducing rappers.

The all the cancelled games, taking away our purchases, delaying, it’s just too much… 

I preordered Avatar cause it was made by the creators of Division 2 again one of my favs… what’s disappointment.. worst game of the year imo.. janky, unfun, Grindy, the combat is the worst part. 

Defiant beta was bad, the first one had so many cheaters, guys sliding at super speed across entire sections of the map… it was a meh game with potential but I wasn’t hoping for anything, expectations low.

I was already being careful since idk if they will revoke my games out of nowhere, but now heartland got canceled and that might be it for me… the last IP that meant something to me cause everything else was killed. And you take the division spinoff away from me? 

No Ghost Recon, Siege’s future is unknown with the money hungry ness and the activism, no splinter cell, no rayman/rabbids, AC has become boring, far cry is also activism central but had good combat, avatar doubled down on the worst of fc6 and got rid of good combat, division became heartless in gameplay and now the spinoff is canceled.. xdefiabt might be ok but it’s Ubi so I don’t even know.. 


Who’s running this? I might just stop doing anything Ubi at this point. This coming from a guy who religiously played Ubi games and spent lots of money in my favs… you’ve really insulted your fanbase over and over.. 

COD has been meh for a while with some shady stuff but they don’t come close to how disappointed and disrespectful UBI has been to its consumers and that’s saying a lot, pls do better.. cause you have potential… what about others, how do you feel about Ubi

Why can Ubisoft Support not admit that their game is broken?,"Assassins Creed Black Flag has been broken for quite some time now. The game only launches when Ubisoft Connect is offline, which has been made needlessly difficult ever since the redesign. And on Geforce Now (which is one of my most used ways to play games atm) offline mode is impossible to activate, leaving me with almost no option to play the game without inconvenience.

I've been trying to tell Support for a few days now in an ongoing case, but they just keep suggesting steps they've already suggested before, requesting files and data I've already given them or completely missing what the actual issue is. It's as if they can't even be bothered to read any previous messages.

I understand that the game is already over a decade old (God, I feel old), but it's still being sold, so imo they have a responsibility to keep the game working. But they keep insisting that the problem is with my system and completely ignore the fact that the issue persists on streaming services that are completely unrelated to my system. It's infuriating.

How to Recover Your Ubisoft Account When Support Isn't Helping: Filing a BBB Complaint,"Hey everyone,

I recently had a stressful experience where my Ubisoft account was hacked, and the email was changed to a Russian one. Despite contacting Ubisoft support multiple times and providing proof of my account they have denied to give my account back

Thankfully, the issue has now been resolved, and I wanted to share a specific step that helped me get my account back: filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB).

Here's how filing a BBB complaint helped me recover my Ubisoft account and the steps you can take if you find yourself in a similar situation:

# Steps to File a BBB Complaint

1. **Gather Evidence**:
   * Document all interactions with Ubisoft support, including support ticket numbers, emails, and screenshots of the issue.
   * Collect evidence of your account ownership, such as purchase receipts or linked accounts.
2. **Visit the BBB Website**:
   * Go to the BBB website at [www.bbb.org](https://www.bbb.org).
3. **File a Complaint**:
   * Navigate to the ""File a Complaint"" section.
   * Provide detailed information about your issue, including how your account was hacked, the lack of response from Ubisoft support, and any evidence you've gathered.
4. **Be Clear and Concise**:
   * Clearly explain the problem and what resolution you are seeking. In my case, I requested that Ubisoft revert the email change and restore my access to the account.
5. **Submit the Complaint**:
   * Once you have filled out all the necessary information, submit your complaint.
6. **Follow Up**:
   * After filing the complaint, you will receive updates from the BBB about the status of your complaint. Ubisoft responded to my BBB complaint within a few days, and my issue was resolved shortly after.

# Why This Works

Filing a complaint with the BBB can prompt a faster response from Ubisoft, as companies take BBB complaints seriously. It adds a level of urgency and accountability, encouraging the company to address your issue promptly.

I hope this helps anyone facing similar issues with their Ubisoft account. If you have any questions about the process, feel free to ask!

Good luck, and stay safe online!. ",13,19,BabaYaga3694,1718386113.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1dfwc5a/how_to_recover_your_ubisoft_account_when_support/

Avatar bug on “Into the Fog” mission,"I'm at the part of this mission to ""Get into the office of Tap Con-1"" however when hack the computer in the office, nothing happens, quest doesn't start or anything. If i walk away from the office and scan with navi sense it still shows me needing to be in the office. I've restarted my game several times, each time i go into the office and hack the computer nothing. According to the quest details I am supposed to be at the source of the voice recording i been hearing while exploring the facility. Any idea's? I think this is a potential game breaking bug preventing me from any further progress.

I found a video with timestamp exactly where I am in mission. however when i hack PC nothing at all happens, looks like a recording is supposed to play. [](https://youtu.be/iz273crthye?si=bhh0s-ttbyio9riq&t=1493)

I don't know what to do at this point other then don't play until it's patched but if anyone can tell me how to fix this, please let me know.

  
EDIT: Solved but mission should be updated to prevent bug/confusion.

Community found a solution for me. I kept going into the vent that opens up in the big room then using that to get into the office. I don't know why but I just assumed that door would not be hackable and opens when you scan the computer, turns out it was the opposite, i was supposed to hack the door and then use that event to exit the room instead, hacking the door triggers the quest properly  
  
I recommend passing this to the bug fix team and change it so that vent in big room doesn't open up until you hack the computer first, this would solve the problem by forcing the player to hack the door instead and not mislead the player into thinking they should use the vent to enter the office.",13,12,Conscious-Dark-658,1702840858.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/18kov95/avatar_bug_on_into_the_fog_mission/
Avatar Frontiers of Pandora - Homecoming quest glitch.,"So basically I started the Homecoming quest, it will have you find members of the Kame’tire clan who have gone rogue.

It will have you do 3 other quest which will lead you to find these members. 
- Reyzu
- Keylu
- Taka’ri

I have completed these quests and now it will say; ‘Search for the wayward members of the Kame’tire - Uwol was last seen talking to Hastu in The Hollows’

It has been days since, and I still cant find Uwol or interact with anyone inside the Hollows, except for Zamhil who gave me the quest. 
Someone has told me it takes one day irl to trigger but it still hasn’t triggered for me.

Anyone who has any ideas please help, I’ve done everything, pass time, fast travel and fly back on my Ikran, waited 24hrs.

*(FIXED FOR ME; So basically I fast traveled to Tower Bravo and it gave me a quest (Uwol’s Shadow), jumped around a bit and I suddenly got a bow and it said I completed the quest. After that it said that I had to meet Hastu in the Hollows, and I could interact with Uwol and Hastu! This completed the Homecoming quest! Maybe if you haven’t got the Tower Bravo powered up, maybe try that? It worked for me!)*

(NOTE: I’m playing on Playstation 5, and I’ve finished the main quests.)

Former member of Ubisoft Support here. Support questions welcome! AMA (Part 3?),"Hey there folks,

Yes, you read correctly. I used to be a member of Ubisoft Support for almost 2 years.

Since Ubisoft Support has hit a pretty big low over the last year, I thought it'd be useful to create this post.

A lot of the posts I have seen, seem to ask the same exact questions everyday. So I thought it would be good for me to create this post, where I can answer some of them. Due to my time in support, I do have a lot of expertise that I think would be useful to share. I have seen other users who have also stated they used to work for them that have also shared their own knowledge to help you folks out.

Here are a few ground rules:

1. Keep in mind, THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL UBISOFT SUPPORT THREAD. I have no way of recovering your account, changing your email, or directly resolving your issue. I will simply be acting as a sort of advisor, that can save you some time while you wait for a response on your support ticket. I am also NOT REPRESENTING UBISOFT in any sort of fashion.
2. Let's try to keep a good tone with no foul language. I will not be responding to questions that ask ""Why is Ubisoft so shit? hurr durr"". Those types of people will be blocked. Regular questions, especially those related to support issues, will be welcome.
3. I am making this post as a hobby and to help out. I won't be monitoring it 24/7 so if I sometimes provide you with a delayed response, that's because life was calling. It may still be faster than Support's response though.
4. Since Ubisoft Support's guidelines are subject to change, and it's been a while since my time there, some of the things I tell you may not have 100% accuracy. Especially, when it comes to account recovery. But as far as I have seen other posts, around 95% of the rules are still the same.
5. If some questions do repeat, you may see me copying the same answers for duplicates. I don't always have the time to manually write a detailed and personalized answer to everyone, so this keeps it simple for me, while also giving you as much info as possible. It's nothing personal.
6. In order to not get into trouble, there will be some things that I will not be able to talk about. So if you ask and I tell you that I cannot answer, that is the general reason. Even though it's been a while since I was there, it's better to be safe than sorry.

On the 3rd note, I have come across other users who also have worked for Ubisoft Support and have the same type of expertise, maybe even more than me. So if they see this and want to join in and answer some questions, they are free to do so.

You could also message me on chat, but I don't really look at my DMs often, so I may respond in an even less timely manner if I'm busy.

Without further a do, feel free to ask anything on your mind. If this post can be pinned for others to see, it would be great.

  
PLEASE READ: I decided to re-post this thread to bump it up. 2 months ago I posted it using a previous account that I have lost and got quite a few questions. Then I tried to make a part 2 with less success. However after a bit of time has passed, I found that some people actually still asked questions on the original thread so I decided to do it again, just for fun.

Recently started playing ALL the assassins creed games and this is what I’ve felt so far,"

So, I’m only talking about my experience but the last time I played an assassins creed game was when unity came out. I tried syndicate but didn’t like the combat and never got around to try origins or anything.

A year and a half ago I saw an offer to buy all the assassins creed games for like $80 bucks AC1 all the way to Valhalla with dlcs and everything so I bought it but never came around to play them. 

2 months ago I didn’t know what to play but tbh I have ALOT of games I haven’t played cause of time so I started all the ac games 
I’m currently in sequence 6 of assassins creed brotherhood and WOW
Last time I played the Ezio games it was on ps3 when I was 13-14 years olds and now I’m 27. It gives me a whole new perspective in a lot of the aspects the game had. Like the fact that you invest money in the city and start to earn income based on those investments. When I was 13 that was just a waste of my money, I wanted to buy all the armor and colors before wasting money in “investments” 
Now I understand a bit better the story that Minerva taught. 
I’m invested in the whole subject 16 story line and I’m playing everything on my time. I feel like when I was younger I rushed the games just to get to the end because I saw that as the best part. Now I understand that the best part is the journey. I’m excited to have the time to play again now

Ubisoft's support system for its users is absolute garbage / non-existent,"I have never experienced anything worse in terms of receiving support for a product, service, or account that I have or own. And it is not just a single user's experience, as I understand there are a lot of people in the similar positions. 

The only way to get any form of help or assistance from Ubisoft is to submit a case to them. I have had a ticket open since the start of October to change my email address as I no longer had access to the email address (the domain owners have switched to a subscription based model and have deactivated old accounts that were not logged into for a period of time).  I used this email 12 years ago when I created my Ubisoft account. No answer whatsoever to date on the ticket. 

Fast forward to yesterday, somebody has logged into my account from Russia, so now my account is compromised. 

I now need to change my password, but in order to do that I need access to the email account associated with my Ubisoft account, but as previously stated I don't have access to it. I also can't change my email address because Ubisoft hasn't gotten back to me for over a month. 

After contacting the domain owners of my old email address, they were able to reinstate my account (with a clean inbox since my old mail was not migrated) and give me access for 3 days, after which I either have to pay the subscription or deactivate my account again. 

Great so now I can change my password right? Wishful thinking, because the email with the link to change my password just does not arrive. Neither does the email to change the email associated with the Ubisoft account, and neither does the link to enable 2FA on the account. No emails are coming through from Ubisoft, at all. It is a small, country specific email domain, and I have read that the system has issues with those. So now I'm left to wait, and pray that Ubisoft answers my ticket that has been open for over a month. 

I try with the admins of the Ubisoft Discord channel, where I have been monitoring the discussions for just two days, only to discover that multiple users are reporting very similar, if not the same, experiences that I am having. A user reported that their account has also been compromised and have been waiting for the password change email for over a week, one user has been waiting for the same for over a month. Multiple users reported that their ticket to change their email addresses (as they don't have access to the email anymore) have been open and unanswered for over 3 months! 

How is it acceptable (or legal maybe?) for a company this size to have no mechanism whatsoever to support users with simple things like changing of passwords and changing of emails, ESPECIALLY in cases where the users' accounts have been compromised. People have hundreds of dollars’ worth of games/stuff on these accounts. This is just unacceptable in my opinion.

I forgot that Outlaws was a Ubisoft game,"Just finished Outlaws.

I’m one of those people who’s sorta anti-Ubisoft. With certain games, you can see their blatant laziness and capitalistic greed, they half ass a lot of stuff, you get what I mean.

Star Wars: Outlaws is deadass the funnest I’ve had with a Ubisoft game. It was fun enough to make me forget I was even playing a Ubisoft game.

Of course, it has its flaws and it’s jank, it’s not an absolutely groundbreaking game at all. But holy shit, it feels like a blast lmao. 

While I do wish there were more places to explore and a bit of a longer story, I’m pretty satisfied with the game as a whole.

They managed to nail the whole Star Wars vibe pretty well, with the markets and environments and such. 

Like I said, I’m usually anti-Ubisoft, but I feel like they actually did a pretty damn good job this time.

The key difference in Watch Dogs 2 that's making me love it!,"I'm finally playing Watch Dogs 2, i'm so pleasantly surprised and i wanted to talk about something i noticed while playing this that i think is very key to my enjoyment, even though i'm fairly early in the game. 

The open world design of this game has a fundamental difference from most Ubisoft games ( been a long time since i played WD1 so can't remember if that one did this as well) and it is that the overall goal of the character is to get more followers to support his crew and not necessarily take control back of a city that is being entirelly controlled by bad guys So by doing this, they avoid their traditional super reptitive ""outpost capture"" gameplay loop and other ""checklist"" type activities.

San Francisco mostly just feels like it exists despite the player and be actually San Francisco at any given day, and not one controlled by an evil army. The world activities just feel more organic and not something that is there just to give me something to do and it all feels so much more enjoyable because of this.

Now, for some reason they went back to the ""take the city back"" style of design for WD:Legion and to me that's going backwards",11,0,Hunk4thSurvivor,1723160822.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1enl2iy/the_key_difference_in_watch_dogs_2_thats_making/

Ubisoft Support is the most infurating experience i have ever made.,"My problem requires a bit of an explanation, not even much, all it takes is a human being that listenes to it to see that this is not a basic problem AI can solve. Yet it is impossible to get through to someone who isnt a Bot at Ubisoft Support. And i have made so many tickets, Ubisoft support doesnt even take the time to answer anymore, they literally just close the ticket without answering my question. I have tried since November 2023 and now i am ready to give up, therby losing over 500€ worth of games and ingamecontent, which i have accumulated on my account since 2014.

I am an idiot and some of it is for sure my own fault. But im still flabbergasted that Ubisoft-Support is incapable of resolving the problem. It should be possible, i know that for a fact.

In 2021 i did an Upsi and when i started Rainbow Six Siege over Steam, i clicked on the prompt that asked me if i want to link this game with my Ubisoft-account. I didnt check if i was logged in with the correct Ubisoft-account at that moment and then it linked my R6S copy to the wrong Ubisoft-account where i collected all my Assassins creed and Far cry games (Back in the days i for some reason thought it made sense to make a clean new ubisoft-account for Rainbow Six). Since i usually played R6S on another Ubisoft-account on which i already purchased all kinds of Operators and skins, i was shocked when i noticed that all my ingame-purchases were gone. I couldńt start this copy of rainbow six on the correct account anymore. So i wrote Ubisoft-support. They helped me by making ANOTHER ubisoft account with a completely new Emailadress which i created soley for this ubisoft account, and then adding all my games and ingame content on this one. Was okay for me, now i had all my games on the same Ubisoft account and i could play rainbow six again. 

Fast forward to Novmeber 2023: something happened, maybe my info got leaked somewhere, but every single emailadress i own was suddenly locked by microsoft because someone tried to enter them all and used the wrong password too many times. I was able to safe my main-Emailadress with the reactivation-form from microsoft and many hours of talking to microsoft-support. But i wasnt able to safe the emailadress i used ONLY for this Ubisoft-account (the reactivation-form wants you to state exact parts of the last 5 received AND sent mails from this account, which is kinda hard when you never wrote any emails from this emailadresse and you only have 2 mails in your inbox, which are 2step-verification-mails, which for some reason dont count for the form). I tried to safe the emailadresse for 3 full months, talking to support daily, them knowing me by name and feeling sorry already. But in the end we had to give up and decided that its time to ask Ubisoft-support if they can help me to change the mailadresse on the account. 

I made 4 different tickets from November 2023 to now (April 2024). Every single time i ended in the same infuriating AI-Loop that just isnt any help at all. They keep advising me to contact my email-providers support to get access to the emailadress again. But the only reason i am writing with Ubisoft support is, because i have talked to my email-providers support extensively. One time a real supporter suddenly pitched in and said „hey, i see you lost your email-access, lets try something else. Can you provide me with purchase confirmations for the numerous games you have bought over steam and linked to your ubisoft-account?“. I weas so happy when i read that, i used the exact instructions to send purchase confirmations and thought finally, my problem gets resolved im not loosing all my games. But the fucking support just ignored the confirmations i sent them and went RIGHT BACK TO „Hi, we can see that you lost your email-access. You should try talking to your email-providers customer support. We  sadly cannot help you with this issue.“ ?!?!

They asked me fpr purchase-confirmations, which i provided, and THEN they decided to still not help me and not give any explanations to why they dont want to help me anymore. Whenever i tell them that i am not satisfied and that i need a problemsolution, they literally just copy paste the text they sent me before and close the ticket. They even started to close the ticket on me WITHOUT answering anymore.

Since i have tried everything with Microsoft and now with ubisoft, this would mean that i have to give up and just let my 15 games and many ingame-purchases with a worth of at least 500€, go.

Does Ubisoft not respond to the Support cases you make?,"SOLVED

Hi, I've been trying to get in contact with Ubisoft support for the last few weeks. I don't know if i'm just impatient, but they don't seem to be responding at all. 

The problem i'm having is that i enabled the 2-step factor to my account back in 2018, but as a kid, i did not save either the verification code or the recorvery codes anywhere. I've tried to look through my email but cannot find the recovery codes anywhere. I just need to connect the 2-step factor to my phone number but can't login and do it, because i don't have the codes for the 2-step login. It's so i can play ranked in rainbow six siege.

Is there any form of live support chat with Ubisoft or does that not exist?

If you can help me in anyway, thank you :).

Rainbow six siege is the worst game in exsistance ,I don’t understand how one can make such a horrible game. And proceed to make it worse with each update. To make a game so bad that beginning players are out with champions their first matches is horrendous or putting the worst plays on one team and the best on the other. How does a multi million dollar company make such shit decisions and somehow make the actual product worse than they originally planned. Then changing the ranking system that’s so flawed that there’s people who get to champion who should be no where near. And champions who can’t get past silver because of their teammates being all coppers. How does this make any sense for a fair game. It doesn’t. Then not to mention the worst map reworks I’ve ever witnessed in my life. Making maps look nothing like they used to at all and making it so confusing and just downright stupid where they take away and add so many things that would make no sense. “This is a realistic and tactical game where you use stealth and team work.” When now the motto is “swing or be swung” with rushing being the meta. Then changing mechanics of the game where it’s not even realistic and now caters to the worst players. Like not being able to cook grenades??? How is that realistic at all anymore it makes them unusable. All of these things and plenty of other things make this game just complete shit and not fun at all anymore. This game is complete bullshit and it will never be an actual good game. ,9,15,At11ok,1709536556.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1b64tag/rainbow_six_siege_is_the_worst_game_in_exsistance/

RB6 Vegas 3 please! (We need this in our lives!),"**Upvote this if you would like to see a new RB6 Vegas 3 game by Ubisoft!**

The mix of 1st-person and 3rd-person cover-shooting was so good! Everything about Vegas 2 was tactical and intense! I used to play on a populated YOLO *(you only live once, no respawn)* server with different objectives, which basically made it like Siege but was, in my opinion, 50x better!

**Please Ubisoft give use RB6 Vegas 3!**

Xbox Controller Issues with Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora,"Hi. I just got the new Avatar game and have been trying to play with controller which should be supported. I looked through the mapping setting and saw nothing odd. When I give inputs on the controller the pc will switch back and forth from pc controls to the controller and adding/doubling/ changing inputs from the controller. This is the only game I am currently having this issue with. For example, when I press down on the left stick I start sprinting as I should but it also opens the onscreen keyboard. In the menus the cursor snaps all over the screen after or during inputs, and when using A button or B button to select or deselect things I can see it flash between keyboard and controller controls at the bottom.

Am I getting punked by Ubisoft customer support?,"Background: I recently had a string of hack attempts happen across many platforms, so I started to go through my accounts to secure them.  I logged in to my Ubisoft account via Xbox associated account linking and found my account associated email has been changed to one I have never seen, own, or recognize. (Can provide email address if allowed within rules)

Now to the stupid loop I am caught in. I sent a support ticket in \~5 day ago hoping I could regain control of my account.  Took them 5 days to get around to helping. when they finally reached out the original agent requested proof of ownership via. purchase history. Cool I can do this just follow the instructions and submit the proof. wait about 1 hour for someone to cycle around again. Good News!! ownership has been verified. now all I need to do is send them the email I need it to be changed back to.  Done. Should only be a couple of minutes then I can secure my account with 2FA. 30 min go by... nothing. Refresh the case webpage cause some genius decided live updating a customer support case chat room is too difficult. New message appeared. because I do not have access to the currently associated email (hackers' email) they cannot verify that I own the account and now "" Due to security reasons"" can't change the email. Now we commence a currently 2 hour round and round loop of me explaining that the email currently associated was fraudulently changed by an illegal 3rd party so I don't have access to it, and them saying ""because you can't verify this email, we cannot make changes to the account."" 

  
OH yeah can't forget this gem of a line"" From here, we can only advise that you attempt to regain access to the email address that the account is registered to. If you are able to do this, we will be more than happy to try to assist you further with recovering the account""

Ubisoft should use Motion Capture more ,"I’ve been playing Star Wars outlaws and it’s been a fun ride, however one of my main criticisms are the non-mocap facial animations. 

A few years back before they went BIG with every single game, all their stories were fully mocapped like Watch dogs 1 & 2 - AC Unity-Syndicate- Origins.

All these games had great stories and cutscenes for that, they felt high quality and high budget. Since they’re making bigger open worlds, I get they can’t mocap everything so why not do the following.

Use motion capture in all story/main mission cutscenes as they’re the most important in the game and use in-game cutscenes for side quests and so on (as well as improve the quality of the ingame engine cutscenes)

It’s probably my biggest gripe with “new” Ubisoft. ",9,3,Timo-D03,1725351329.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1f7um3n/ubisoft_should_use_motion_capture_more/

Does Ubisoft customer support exist?,"Posting here because apparently Ubisoft's Discord, Facebook, Twitter etc all just end up routing you back to their same ""help"" page to open a ticket. A ticket which creates a case. A case that never gets reviewed. 

I hadn't used my Ubisoft Windows app in a while. But recently thought about buying the new Prince of Persia game. My app required an update, which inadvertently required me to log back in again. And the disaster begins..

After logging in with my correct password, my 2FA required a code to be sent to me via email that I need to enter. Well, after 2 weeks of trying every single day and trying different web browsers, no email ever comes with a code. Yes, I checked all spam and junk folders. Now my only assumption is that my account may have been compromised during my time of inactivity and my email changed on my account and the code is being sent elsewhere that I have no access to. 

First thing I did was look for a phone # to call Ubisoft. Of course one does not exist. They want you to open this ""case ticket"". So obviously I did. It's been 10 days with zero updates or responses to my case. This seems wild to me considering a company like Steam can resolve a compromised account in less than 24 hours. 

After searching for further assistance options, I see there is a Discord channel for support. Out of desperation, I join and make a comment like ""How does one receive a response to case that's been open for xx days regarding a possible compromised account?"". Apparently this resulted in an instant ban from the channel and now I can't type any message about anything anywhere on their Discord. Nice. Also couldn't help but notice their channel was riddled with other comments from people also complaining their can't access their accounts, they've been waiting weeks now for a response etc etc. I assume they all got banned too. 

Lastly, I see there is an Ubisoft Facebook page. I try hitting their"" contact us"" button which comically loops you back to their homepage to open a ticket. What happens it you try to open another ticket? You get a message that says ""additional tickets will only delay your response further.""

This whole process is enough to drive someone to abandoning their existing Ubisoft library forever. How does a company not actually offer any form of ""customer support""?

Ubisoft Connect crashes on startup 95% of the time. Please help.,"I recently received a code for Star Wars Outlaws as a gift and I saw that I needed Ubisoft Connect to install it. No problem I thought, I'll just download it.

The launcher hower simply refuses to work on my machine. Once installed, it took probably 20 attempts to boot it up before I got to the login screen. Afterwards, it kept crashing again and again and again.

Most of the time I would get no error message, a few times I would get "" Initialisation Error 2"" other times it would just mention a non descript ""unrecoverable error"" and dump a crash report somewhere on my PC that I don't know how to read.

I powered my way through it and was able to eventually redeem the code and install the game. I was even able to boot it up and play it. But then Ubi Connect crashed again, and now I am unable to play the game whatsoever, as Ubisoft Connect crashes before the game can boot.

I have tried reinstalling Ubisoft Connect. I tried updating all my drivers, I restarted my PC, I deleted the ""Ubisoft Game Launcher"" folder from AppData as the official Ubisoft support site recommended. I tried reinstalling it on a different drive. Nothing worked.

Has anybody else experienced this? Is there any solution? I am willing to try anything at this point, I just want to play the game.

"Ubisoft, in 2024 and beyond, please, NO MORE Online Only SP Games.","as title says. going forward, please don't do anymore SP games that require internet to play. This comes from someone with 24/7 fiber.

it's the principle of the thing. just because many gamers have 24/7 internet, doesn't mean it should used be utilised as extra DRM.

online only games have limited replay value. online drm is anti consumer.

it's fine for MMO type games but it sucks for games with full SP campaigns. we should be able to play these games when and where we want to without being greeted by ""CONNECTION TO SERVER FAILED, THIS GAME REQUIRES INTERNET TO PLAY"".

To this day this happens a lot with your games, such as r6 extraction and ghost recon breakpoint.

it's also annoying when maintenance stops you from playing sp content.

so please just keep that bs in online focused games and not games with SP content.

also think of the players that still suffer from spotty internet who mistakenly buy a game that has no offline play. sucks for them the most.

This practice needs to stop. If you are concerned with piracy, just stick to what's usually used but don't restort to extra online drm as all it does it piss gamers off and results in less sales.

it should be a no brainer that online drm hurts sales if it's a game with sp content. do you not see the complaints? oh right, you closed your forums and then your brand new discussion boards.

now all you have is discord for consumers to complain on.

you aren't doing yourselves any favours.

"Avatar game is buggy and broken, fix it","Having this issue on Avatar Frontiers Of Pandora for PC. 

The game is extremely buggy and laggy. my specs on my PC  are definitely not the issue and I've tried lowering all graphic settings and video settings to low and there is no improvement.
The game acts like I am moving too fast and can't keep up with loading textures and audio and forces the game to get confused of where I am on the first mission and missing checkpoints and completely glitching out the game.
For example, First mission, Escape TAP, I did this apparently too fast and when I enter the forest (pandora), the game seems to think I am not in pandora and will not load in the next objective which is to find the guy that helped you escape and gives you a Bow. So the only way to fix this is to retrace your steps, go back into the facility and walk slowly until the game catches up. But currently now I have to wait 5 minutes to load low quality textures.

"WARNING: Ubisoft takes your money, but if you need support, they will ghost you!","*Update 12 Nov: I got sick of waiting, so yesterday I filed a right-to-access request under our equivalent to the GDPR.

They have now pivoted from telling me how to download my data, to actually providing the support I was looking for from the get-go. Thank you privacy legislation, I guess.*

&#x200B;

Wow, what a week.

I have been fighting with Ubisoft to regain access to my Anno 1800 games after Ubisoft Connect forgot my details, and I could not log back into the account. All I get is various errors. So, I went to the Ubisoft support site to get help.

To my disappointment, they [shut down their live-chat support over a month ago](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/article/ubisoft-support-changes-to-live-support/000105563) in favour of using Discord, Twitter and Facebook. They provide an [account recovery form](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/contact?platform=29&game=50003&category=100&hideFields=all&af=1), which I filled in last weekend.

Usually, when you create a support ticket, you get an automated email telling you the ticket was created and someone will get back to you ASAP, but to my surprise, no email.....

Later that day, I questioned whether I had created a support ticket, so I tried again. This time, I took a screenshot of my ticket ID. A few days pass, and I get no response, so I go to the Discord server and ask in their support forum how long it would typically take to hear back. One of the Ubisoft employees told me that they could not give me that information and that I was off-topic. They then closed my request.

[The only response I have had from support thus far. tldr; not our problem, go away!](https://preview.redd.it/q2vjwtgsrkzb1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd6920656877d094320c839cfe6025ad31d421f)

I start talking to others on their Discord server and realise this is a far larger problem. Of the 19 active support topics in their Anno help section seven posted by other people are about similar issues, and all of them seem to be having issues getting support:

*Discord links: you have to be on their server to read these:*

1. [Ubisoft connect linked to the wrong account](https://discord.com/channels/863058244934696961/1172593837475102810)
2. [Ubisoft Connect linked wrong account](https://discord.com/channels/863058244934696961/1172537455434534913)
3. [no anno access anymore](https://discord.com/channels/863058244934696961/1172247932725104802)
4. [Game support doesn't work](https://discord.com/channels/863058244934696961/1171446358796943510)
5. [Anno Game shows Expired](https://discord.com/channels/863058244934696961/1172418687303688252)

7. [Anno 1800](https://discord.com/channels/863058244934696961/1171150217953955860)

Talking to one of the users, I realise that while tickets created under account recovery seem to get shredded - if we create tickets under billing (*aka the I am trying to give you money, but a bug on your site won't let my* category), I get the automatic email and the ticket shows up on my account page.

It really seems like Ubisoft has fired the customer support reps who help existing customers as part of their mass layoffs while keeping those who can continue to take in money.

Six days on, still no support, no access to a refund through Steam because I had played this game for more than two hours before the issue occurred, and all they do is send me back to [Ubisoft who ghost me and dozens if not hundreds of others](https://nz.trustpilot.com/review/www.ubisoft.com?stars=1) .

To take our money, give us a broken game we cannot use, and ghost us when trying to get any level of customer support is tantamount to theft.

I have filed a complaint against Ubisoft, with the New Zealand Commerce Commission, as I am fairly sure Ubisoft is [violating the Consumer Guarantees Act](https://www.consumerprotection.govt.nz/help-product-service/streaming-and-downloads/#:~:text=Digital%20products%20are%20covered%20by%20the%20Consumer%20Guarantees%20Act%20(CGA).%20Like%20all%20products%2C%20digital%20products%20must%20meet%20guarantees%20set%20out%20in%20the%20CGA%3A), which gives all New Zealanders the right to a refund, repair or replacement if a product they purchase is not fit for the purpose of which it was sold.

&#x200B;

**Call to action:**

If you, your friends or family have had any similar experience with Ubisoft, please post about it below. Give as much detail as you can; I hope we can gain enough attention to publicly embarrass Ubisoft into action.

&#x200B;

p.s. It's nice to see that the company that cannot find time to support paying customers can find time to downvote their customer's criticism!

Worst Support Ever? (YES),"A friend of mine has an old e-mail associated to his ubisoft connect account, and since he moved on pc recently and wanted to play ranked on rainbow six siege with me and some of my friends we thought that it would have been a great idea.

The problem is that in order to play ranked you need to enable 2FA verification and when we tried to get the code via e-mail we couldn't. So I thought: ""*Well let's change the e-mail to a new one*""... The problem is that in order to change your e-mail you need a verification code... **That we can't get**...

So I said: ""*Well let's contact the Ubisoft Support Team via a ticket, what could possibly go wrong*""... The first ticket was opened the **11th of September**... **and we still didn't get a single reply!**

"So, are we going to rename this sub to ""Assassins Creed & Far Cry"" Yet?","**Since, it's apparently the only Ubisoft games you guys play.**

The amount of complaints I see about how Ubisoft have no creativity and release the same game over and over is INSANE. So, Let's just look at some recent and upcoming Ubisoft games, their user/critic scores (from metacritic) etc. and see if Ubisoft is the problem or, your taste in games is;

* Xdefiant - An FPS game akin to Call of Duty
* Skull and Bones - Open World, PvX, Naval-Combat game
* Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown - Metroidvania, action platformer - 86 Critic Score
* Assassin's Creed Nexus VR - VR game - 78 Critic Score, 92 User Score
* Assassin's Creed Mirage - Open World Action RPG - 76 Critic Score, 72 User Score
* The Crew Motorfest - Open World, online, Driving/racing game - 76 Critic Score, 77 User Score
* Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope - Turn Based action game - 86 Critic Score, 75 User Score
* Rider's Republic - Open World, Online, Extreme Sports game - 77 Critic Score, 69 User Score
* Immortals Fenyx Rising - Open World Action RPG more akin to BotW - 81 Critic Score, 77 User Score

So, that's a list of notable releases from the last **3 YEARS.** In 3 years we have had some action RPGs, A turn based game, a driving game, an extreme sports game, a VR game, a Metroidvania, an FPS, a Naval combat game **AND MORE** as that list doesn't include every Ubisoft release from the last 3 years. With those games averaging a 78.62 review score across metacritic for user and critic reviews. 

The point I'm getting at is; Ubisoft spans 20+ studios and has something like 20,000 employees. The blanket statement's people use when referring to them is insane and just untrue. They make some fucking stinkers, they also make some bangers. 

You guys who go around saying that every ubisoft game is a mid open World ARPG are doing NOTHING but expose your own terrible taste in games OR, that you're incapable of forming your own opinion. 

I don't particularly like Ubisoft as a whole, they have terrible customer support, terrible shoehorning of MTX into everything and some terrible execs at the top. But, PLEASE, can we get rid of this sitty, small minded and factually incorrect sentiment that they release the same games over and over. THA'S ON YOU. Branch out, try their other games or stop acting like you have a clue what you're talking about in a subject you very clearly lack experience in. It's honestly impressive how many people here, on the UBISOFT sub, know so little about their catalogue of games. 

I swear some of you bought Odyssey and Valhalla, saw they were similar and went ""Yep, the people on Reddit were right, Ubisoft reskin the same game and sell it everytime"" and have been echoing that opinion ever since. 

I just had to say this, and hopefully with it being a post, some people can see it and maybe stop looking like idiots in comments. ",8,24,--clapped--,1705247914.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/196j0j8/so_are_we_going_to_rename_this_sub_to_assassins/

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora The Unsung Hunter Quest bugged due to game crashing during investigation.,"I have run across a bug in ""The Unsung Hunter""  sidequest which has broken it for me and so that I am stuck and cannot progress it.

I am not talking about the red warning this gets if you don't complete it right away which goes away after completing the  “To Friends Departed”  quest.

I was at the camp where you meet aleymun and had started an investigation then my game crashed, upon logging back in she is gone from the camp and I cannot interact with the investigation items at the camp.  My quest log is telling me to talk to Aleymun at the camp but she is not there and I cant interact with any investigation items.  The quest marker is showing at hometree but she is not there either.

Anyone have anything similar to this happen to them and if so have they managed to find a work around?

***EDIT: The quest has reset itself not sure how or why but I was able to talk to them at home tree again and restart the investigation....not sure what reset it. I did start a new game and delete the new game just before logging in to play, I also did some other quests last night but it was still bugged when I logged out of game.***",8,16,BinaryPirate,1702433921.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/18h5yrq/avatar_frontiers_of_pandora_the_unsung_hunter/

Things that are not being talked enough about ubisoft's anti-consumer practices ? ,"I am a bit concerned about how this whole ubisoft fallout is going to play out. Not because I don’t think they deserve it which they absolutely do, but because the online discourse seems to be heavily focused on a few specific mistakes that they’ve been making. And while the things that are being talked about are things that need to be talked about, I am barely seeing any mention of issues like single player games requiring internet to play, the requirement to have a dedicated launcher that gets in the way of playing a game that I own in every possible way, the aggressive and borderline illegal pushing of stuff that requires gamers to spend more money to do even basic things on games that they’ve bought and already fully paid for, their employees asking gamers to be comfortable not owning games to name just a few.

I feel like ubisoft is finally waking up and starting to think about making amends but when no one talks about these deep rooted issues, I feel like the company is going to get the wrong (or insufficient) feedback/message and continue to fail. If I am being honest, I want them to succeed because they make some of my most favourite games but the way they’re doing it is clearly not working.

So I wanted to highlight a few things that \*personally\* irk me. I am sure there are more and some of the issues may not resonate with some and that’s fine. So in no particular order, these are the things that bother \*me\* (and I’m sure several other gamers).

Why does ubisoft lump every gamer into one category and treat us all like shit ? I get it Ubi, you’re a business and you need to make money and when you see people illegally acquiring your products, it might be disheartening so if you want to take measures to prevent or reduce that, by all means go ahead and do it, but can you please not make is so annoying that you end up discouraging people who actually want to buy and play the games ?

When I buy a single player game, I just want it to be installed on my machine and clicking on it should take me straight to the game. Why should I wait for the clunky and ugly launcher to show up an ugly black empty store page and have to stare at it till whatever checks need to be performed and then wait so long till I can actually get to the game’s menu. And especially when there’s an update to either the game or the launcher, I now have to wait even more and click yes to a bunch of UAC prompts and once everything is done, it forgets my login and I have to login every single time. I just want to play my single player game on my gaming handheld device but no .. I have to fumble with entering a long 20 character mix of numbers symbols and hieroglyphs on a tiny virtual keyboard to even get to the next stage. I could install password managers (which I obviously don’t want to on a gaming handheld) to make it easier but I still need to copy and paste the password.

Why can’t I just play the game offline? If a check needs to be performed, do it on some schedule and clearly show when the last check was done and how much longer I have before the next check locks me out. Give options for me to extend the verification by performing an adhoc check so that I can briefly connect to the internet during my travels and “top-up” my access. There are ways to implement validation checks while still maintaining good user experience for legitimate users but it saddens me that the company’s knee-jerk reaction is to implement aggressive checks at the cost of UX for the honestly majority of users. The verification checks themselves .. why do they have to be tied to ubisoft launcher at all ? Why not have a separate lightweight headless process that performs the checks in the background when the game is loading before the menu is shown ? Surely a company as large as ubisoft can figure out a way, right ?

Why is there no update on issues that plague existing games ? Does there have to be million games released in quick succession before the previous ones are even done ? I bought avatar frontiers of pandora and while the reception has generally been lukewarm, I absolutely had a blast playing and sunk around 100 hours in it. \*had\* being the keyword here because the game has suddenly stopped working and asks me to purchase the skybreaker DLC to even play the base game that I’ve already paid for. How is this even legal ? I wanted to give ubisoft the benefit of doubt and thought that this is probably a recently introduced bug that will quickly be patched but no .. looks like this issue is widespread and has been open for months and ubisoft knows about it but still there is no information about when or if it will ever be resolved.

Which brings me to the whole “forced updates” and lack of options to delay or deny updates. Games are software and software will have bugs no matter how well it’s implemented or tested but the audacity of ubisoft to think that they’re infallible, that their servers will never go down and that they will never have bugs when the reality is exactly the opposite is a clear indicator of some evil force within the company that’s acting against well meaning stakeholders. Because there’s no way that actual developers who slog day and night to create these games don’t know about these limitations and the gamers also know these because they face these routinely. So it looks like ubisoft’s management is absolutely out of touch and is in the middle of this whole mess because it’s pretty clear that the management made decisions to rush out unfinished products. Even worse is the complete silence and the way the company just shrugs it off as business as usual. No wonder people don’t trust ubisoft. Something drastically needs to change in order to win back the lost trust.

Why do I HAVE to login to a ubisoft account to play assassins creed on a playstation 5 ? It slowly crept in. First it was not required at all. Then an option to login was added but was not mandatory. Then with Valhalla, it suddenly became mandatory to login to a ubisoft account in order to play a game that I bought on playstation ? Why ? It got so annoying that eventually I caved and logged in, only to have a severely degraded experience. The game which was buttery smooth before on PS5 started to have micro stutters every now and then. Not to mention all the useless avenge quests bugging out and constantly bombarding the screen with crap like “XYZ has been slain. Avenge their death” or something along those lines. More filler padding on an already padded game just doing the same thing over and over again. It got to a point that I couldn’t do a single action in the game without the same “avenge” notification popping up with an annoyingly loud sound (I am talking like a notification every second type frequent). I dropped the game right there and never looked back. Why do I not have an option to say “no” to the forced login ? why can’t I just peacefully play the game (which I paid a premium for) in peace ?

Engage with the users more actively please ? Don’t treat users as cash cows to milk till death, eh ? Why not have an honest conversation like a reddit AMA or some channel that the company is comfortable with and take criticism constructively instead of gaslighting everyone ? Sure, there are always going to be people who take it too far with their criticism but the solution is not to assume everyone is like that and turn a blind eye. In fact, there’s so much backlash because there are so many problems and while some people may not know how to voice them properly, it’s absolutely important to listen to the ones that are willing to have a discussion and willing to provide feedback ? Why not be transparent when issues are reported by acknowledging them and giving routine status updates instead of leaving users hanging ? Isn’t that basic courtesy to show to people who have trusted the company enough to spend their time and money in ?

Do better Ubisoft.

Really disappointed with the black Shinobi in AC Shadows,"When I play a game in Japan, I want to play as a Japanese male, not an African.

The same as when I play a game in Africa, I want to play as an African male.

I really like the Japanese female, but the problem is with the black male.

I'm not going to buy the game and many people won't. The trailer at this time has about 150k likes and 110k dislikes.

Apart from that the game will be very bad. You may get excited with the cinematic trailer. But the game probably will have unbalanced gameplay unless you buy double XP and double coins. Full of microtransactions, where some of them will be pay to win (like how the most strong armor in Valhalla is a microtransaction one). It will be very lengthy where even if you finish it, you won't have any energy or motivation to 100% complete it. And also the game won't have anything to do with the cinematic trailer (as the previous entries).

Ubisoft is done. I'm also gonna sell my copies of Valhalla and Mirage, even at a low price, to make sure that at least someone won't give them one more sale and to make sure I won't continue with the series an any more.

You can downvote me, delete my comment or even call me out. But this won't change the fact that Ubisoft is done and that in the coming months many articles like Ubisoft is firing employees (because it doesn't have the money to keep them) or Ubisoft is ready to bankrupt and cancels games are going to come.

Edit 1: Sorry, I mixed Shinobi with Samurai on the title.

I just purchased Assassin’s creed rogue and it also has this issue. I am assuming it’s the engine of the game or something because they both have the same gameplay and I own every assassins creed game on PC and all the other games start with no issue. Everytime i try to start the game it’s starts for a split second and then stops running as shown in the video. I’ve tried to verify game files and that didn’t fix it, ran the game as administrator, turned off in game overlay, and nothing has worked. If anyone knows what i need to do please let me know.

Ubisoft support team getting better???!!,"So, essentially, I have heard a lot of negative responses from the community and mostly gave up on my account. Some background information, my account got hacked safe to say 1-2 years ago and I had not noticed since its been a long time since I have played a Ubisoft game and wanted to see the old games I used to play, then I noticed that my account had been hacked and everything was changed, but when I try to open with my Epic Games it would open directly to my old account which had disconnected all my other accounts and as well as changed my password, then I sent a response to Ubisoft to wait for their response.  


(Skip to Present Day)  
  
I recently got a response (5 months later) regarding a case I sent, and I just gave them verification. It is safe to say the entire interaction took 30 minutes to 1 hour before I got my account back. Not to sure if this case is a bit easier than the others, because I could still access the account that was hacked. Seeing from how negative the community is with Ubisoft I think this is a good sign of change within Ubisoft? or maybe am just lucky?

Complaint about the support service,"The English support (on https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/help/cases) works terribly. Better to say - it doesn't work. They:

1) copy-paste a previous reply which is not relevant to the questions;

2) give empty replies when you ask questions or ask for something (screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/pi7v691.png);

3) ignore questions, requests, even if you write ""it is very important"";

4) give contradictory answers and don't want to explain these contradictions;

5) change the status to ""updated"" or close without a reply;

6) continue to do all this after asking to stop.

That is because there is no rating the quality of support (which others have), and they do what they want.

If you get a normal agent, you can't continue to talk with him because they are switched every time.

"Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora ""autosave"" isn't saving at all","So I recently went to Kansas for a funeral. I brought along my Xbox to continue to play this game. Now before I left I had done all the Kinglor Forest, discovered all the labs, all the Na'vi encampments and progressed to the Upper Plains. So imagine my surprise when I load up my Xbox on 12/14/2023 (Thursday) to discover that ALL my content after The Wandering Clan was not saved at all. But wait, its supposed to have an autosave right? NOPE!!! It doesn't even function correctly.

Now I was rather annoyed, but figured, screw it I'll redo the content. Upgraded my equipment, explored the entirety of the Kinglor Forest, discovered more rare parts, did some more quests, completed the entire southern half of the Upper Plains, blew up more of those balloon machines. In general, I was having a blast, which helped me cope with losing my grandmother. Course I didn't fully turn off my Xbox until yesterday morning when I left to return to Michigan, as I have the power option set to Sleep setting.

Now fast forward to this morning: I fired up my Xbox again a few minutes ago (now I have 102.3GB free on my Xbox out of 1TB, so plenty of space to save the game) and guess what ALL MY CONTENT IS GONE AGAIN!!! The game hasn't even autosaved since 12/12/2023 at 9:30 PM. So now I am back to where I was when I went to freaking Kansas. I have now lost any desire to continue to play this game because this is unacceptable. I would love to know which moronic developer thought that removing a manual save was a good choice. Not about to invest anymore time into this game until a fix is made. I mean I love this game sure, its visually appealing, the quests are good the combat isn't terrible, but why should I invest time into a game that is simply not even going to save it?

&#x200B;

Quests I have to redo before returning to Upper Plains: A meal and a memory. Teachable Moment. Severed Bonds (repeatable): Deadly Hunt (this was a challenge) and the Wandering Clan. Like I have now done these twice. Ubisoft seriously needs to get their heads out of their backsides and use the brains they have. I have never lost content like this before like this on any game. Not even on Fallout 4 with their infamous save corruption on release. Also I have completed all the side quests I had available and exploration quests and still the game will not save",6,17,Kainbas88,1702831992.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/18kljdp/avatar_frontiers_of_pandora_autosave_isnt_saving/

When I looked on the Ubisoft support they said you can get recovery codes or turn off 2FA in account settings. The problem is I can't log in without 2FA so I'm stuck in an infinite loop of trying to get codes to access any of my accounts.

That fourth episode of Captain Lazerhawk really caught me off guard in so many ways.,"I mean the first three episodes had a lot going on and then some, but I certainly wasn’t expecting that fourth episode to drop some major unexpectecies just right outta nowhere like that!  Not only did they just jump scared us with full on pixelated live action actors throughout the episode… but they also made the chick voicing the warden HOT too?! Like, unexpectedly hotter then she ever needed to be compared to her animated form?

I mean that in itself was more of a jumpscare in itself but that whole thing was something I NEVER expected to see in a show full of various Ubisoft characters spread throughout it. ESPECIALLY when she’s related to freakin SAM FISHER of all people!! 🤯 I mean it took me a bit to really put two and two together since the last time I heard the name, Sarah was white but dang! That was certainly quite a bomb to drop suddenly.

And talk about going above and beyond with the whole 1980s esthetic too! The pixelated filters placed on the actors straight up looked like what one would’ve seen in games made in the mid to late eighties, especially those made for PCs during that era! Though there, I think it's more common with games during the '90s since that was when digitized live action actors and FMVGs were all the rage during that decade on PC.

It was a bit unnerving and uncanny seeing these live action actors with this digitized effect overlayed on them, especially on the warden, but at the same time, it was pretty impressive how they got that look down.",6,0,JustCallMeTsukasa-96,1699841750.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/17u0enz/that_fourth_episode_of_captain_lazerhawk_really/

"Can I get help from anyone, Literally anyone","So essentially I had a ubisoft account, switched to PC and lost access to it from PS, don't have access to the email on it since the account is like 5-6 years old and don't remember fhe password. Understandably I can't get access to the account at all and ubisoft has been uncooperative thus far. My phone number is linked to the account but since that's supposedly somehow ""not valid evidence"" that I'm the owner of the account they refuse to give me access.

Now I'm fine with that, except because my phone number is linked to that account I can't link it to my new one. This means I am very restricted Multiplayer wise in UBISOFT games because you have to activate 2-Factor Auth and have a phone number to play in most of their games, specifically ranked on siege in my case. 

Does anyone know how I can get in contact with anyone from the support team or perhaps a way to unlink my phone number from that account. So far I've made multiple tickets which have been met with an automated response to there help guides which have literally no helpful information to fix the problem and do not offer the option to Speak to a support agent. I currently have a ticked open/ongoing case with them but they have yet to respond.

Ghost Recon: Breakpoint,"So I've been playing raids lately, and I must say, they sure dropped the ball on realism with this. Not only do they require you to play it with a full 4 man human squad (unlike every other aspect of the game), but all the boss levels are uncreative bullet sponges that force you to approach them the exact same way, gone is any element of stealth or creativity.

Not only that, if you raise an alarm and they call for backup, the game spawns in 5 wolves close to your position, who know exactly where you are and even tho it says they can't see you, they'll run after you until they catch you, then spot you, then kill you.

If you happen to drop a landmine as soon as they spawn and run away, they'll all blow up, and then soon after, another 5 wolves will spawn in and do the same. If you happen to escape where they can't follow you, such as off the cliff... then an attack heli will spawn and close on your direct location.

I love the realism of this game, but Raid was a real lost opportunity. They could've done a lot better than resorting to an arcade shoot em up. The gimmicks for ""difficulty"" sake is such a disappointment, absolutely kills immersion, and the aspects that make this game stand out among the rest.

I wish they made a realism variant for raids that didn't rely on these cheap tricks for difficulty and made the bosses an open world opponent that could be tackled in more than one way.

What would make such a mode stand out even more is taking notes from Splinter Cell: Blacklist, by making missions that can be accomplished either by guns blazing (assault), stealth kills (panther) or non-lethal sneaking pass enemy lines (ghost), and rewarding players accordingly.

Other than that, I'm really liking this game. I have logged around 220 hours so far, but I can't help but feel raids could've been so much more than what it is.

Any thoughts? What would you change or add to the game if you could? Would love to hear others' thoughts. 

P.s. what's with needing to shoot a helmet off a heavy (machine gunner) when you headshot them with a bloody 50cal sniper rifle, ain't no one surviving a bullet of that caliber to the cranium, I don't care how bulky the helmet is, it could be made of tungsten and you still dead!",5,0,Blackmist3k,1728729217.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1g1xaq0/ghost_recon_breakpoint/

Steam keys should be option in Collector's Editions,"So, Ubisoft is changing their way after 5 years and I think that it's okay but since their last day1 realese on Steam something else changed also - there is no more box version of their games on PC. So, if the only way to get something physical is by buying Collector's Edition, then there is no doubt about me that I should be able to choose my PC platform. You get universal code which you activate on special site, and then you can choose your preferable platform. Right now it should be of course Ubisoft Connect, Steam and Epic Games Store. It is so simple and Ubisoft offers this kind of treatment previously for some add-ons, also others publishers offers something familiar sometimes. It would be absolutely great move and everyone, who buys PC version, would be able to get their preferable edition and platform. Furthermore, it's actually so bad that you must buy so expensive edition, and you really don't have a choice and in some situation you'll pay twice if you really want to play on your favorite platform. Also in my opinion it is so much easier to run native Steam games on Steam Deck or Linux in general so it's a no-brainer that the only right way is the choice in this matter.

Ubisoft Connect Assassins Creed IV Black Flag: Is the game launching ok for you with the current launcher?,"tldr; Is anyone else able to launch Black Flag using the Ubi Connect Launcher as intended?

I bought Black Flag a few years ago on Ubisoft Connect store and it worked fine. I tried to revisit it this week on Geforce Now, but it wouldn't launch.

Out of curiosity, I decided to try firing the game back up on my own PC, but the game crashes at ""synchronizing achievements"". I also discovered that you can no longer opt out of the Ubi Connect Beta, and the Beta doesn't have an option to enable ""offline mode"", which some people on YouTube have mentioned is the solution for getting the game to run.

After some tinkering, I figured out how to put the Ubisoft Connect Beta into offline mode. The game now launches, but none of the online stuff works. I tried reaching out to Ubi support to see what's going on, and I'm about 20 messages deep jumping through their hoops of providing system logs and driver updates and pretty much everything under the sun, with no admission that their launcher might be the problem. It's super frustrating, to the point that I'd never recommend another Ubi game to anyone, because if it doesn't work, you are SoL.

I’ve played the Jedi games and obviously loved both of them. In fact, I still have plenty of extra stuff to do in Survivor.

"What's going on in Ubisoft exactly, specifically their business and gamedev model?","So recently have been doing a sort of deep dive into Bethesda's games, trying to figure out what went wrong, what went right, and trying to understand more about what's currently happening between Bethesda and its customers. Now that I have sort of reached a conclusion with Bethesda, I want to know more about Ubisoft. 

From what I've observed, Ubisoft has sort of reached a point of stagnation where their recent installments, especially in their Assassin's Creed games, has been nothing but cookie cutter products, following the origins formula. Meanwhile, Far Cry 6 has been nothing but a mediocre success to the point where nobody is talking about it anymore. Their latest watchdogs game, Legion, is crudely designed and a huge downgrade from the second installment of the franchise. The latest things I've heard about their games now is how they're trying so hard to adhere to cultural accuracy while making the game as fantastical as possible, not to mention how this ""tryhardedness"" left a bad taste in the community's mouth.

This got me thinking, what went wrong? From my understanding, people started not liking the franchise after black flag. Meanwhile the old AC games gets a lot of constant praise until today. People also seem to like origins but not the later installments following this formula. Ubisoft also gains their infamy by seemingly not trying to innovate more with their games. I get that they're a business that has to make money and that a tried and true formula is the safest bet compared to the riskier option of experimenting with their games, but perhaps there is something more than that behind the scenes. Is it maybe because of their change of vision? Maybe investors that wants too quick of returns? Or maybe are they leaking money everywhere that they couldn't deviate from the formula too much because it would be detrimental to their finances? Could anyone perhaps elaborate more on their situation and why they came to be?",5,7,mega_lova_nia,1719551735.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1dqbx1f/whats_going_on_in_ubisoft_exactly_specifically/

Reconsider Watchdogs,"

I have been a long fan of Ubisoft games, from the old-school Assassin Creed games to the classic Prince of Persia. I have been very impressed by how the team has pushed forward into one of the most world-renowned video game companies in the gaming business. To that, I have run across articles stating Ubisoft's intention to table quite a few games in order to focus on a large abundance of Assassin Creed games. Now, don't get me wrong, I can comprehend the need to put some things on hold to focus on others. It is a respectful way of approaching tasks so you can get the level of polish necessary to increase the level of success. I just believe that Ubisoft is tabling, indefinitely, Watch Dogs at a time when I think the gaming community could use this intellectual property.

I have played all three Watch Dogs and truly fell in love with the series starting with Watch Dogs 2. The approach to WD2 was not only an attractive packaging but it also captivated a lot of fun to the gaming loop. With every minute I played WD2, I found myself torn between making money from doing side missions so I could dress up my main character and forwarding the story which had me laughing from one adventure to another. It was, in my opinion, a very long game, but it was nothing like the Assassin Creed games of late. Honestly, that is another reason why the game was so approachable. The world that was created for WD2 just seemed to be a very decent blend that resulted in such a satisfying conclusion that had me waiting for Watch Dogs 3. Of course, everything can't always be good and I acknowledge that there aren't any games that I have come across that I'd consider perfect, so my constructive criticism is warranted.

One of the biggest issues with WD2 is the single playable character. To me, Ubisoft crafted such fun and loveable characters that it was a shame that we didn't get a chance to take them out in the field. The story was focused on DedSec's adventure and expansion of their popularity, which makes sense. I just think we could have had a chance to expand the gamer's attachment to these characters so that they hold more of an impact on the story as we scurry to the conclusion. In my opinion, it may seem minor, but in regards to the story, I can't help but hold interest in the members who were already established. Especially after finalizing the DLC. That would have been the perfect moment to allow us to play as our favorite DedSec members.

My other gripe wasn't anything apparent to me until I was highly engrossed in Watch Dogs 3. That gripe was the limited animation that Marcus had at his disposal. Marcus was such a capable fighter with his unbreakable ball and rope, but from the tutorial of the game to the final mission, your takedowns, and attacks seemed far too limited. It isn't all doom and gloom because the parkour animations are outstanding and even though they greatly fixed in Watch Dogs 3, they didn't carry over the parkour animation to WD3.

Nothing could extinguish my excitement for the next chapter in the newly established DedSec community and for everything I was excited about, it didn't disappoint. The intro to Watch Dogs 3 was exceptional. The agent that we had at our disposal introduced us to the controls but also introduced us to the animation takedowns that would fuel every minute of my time in this game. This inspired me to play through the game not just once, or twice but three times and still play to this day. I feel that Ubisoft has crafted a world and scenario that was grounded in realism with a sprinkle of sci-fi technology that made players feel capable but not unstoppable.

I could probably write another page about the animations alone but I want to just
commend the dedication in allowing the animators to fully approach all the game's animation with such fluidity and artistic flare. The game does something rare that other games don't and that is rewarding players who test outside their comfort zone and discover all the other characters who have unique capabilities or skills. The silence of the nail gun, the defibrillator, the sledgehammer, and even a hypnosis pendant all make each character feel unique and a joy to use. Hand-to-hand combat had a fun yet challenging rock-paper-scissors aspect to it and the gunplay in the game wasn't perfect but fit the character's skill level for most people since they weren't all mercenaries who had experience with weapons.

The story does take hold of your emotions once you start to unravel how DedSec is being weaponized to further the agenda of multiple bad actors. More so, the betrayal that is revealed truly motivated every one of my following mission success so that we can get back at this person whom we trusted. Again, ending the story left me in the same place as WD2 did; anticipating the next approach to the DedSec situation.

Just like WD2, WD3 isn't immune to constructive criticism. I love the game but the running animation was a bit awkward in my opinion. Especially in comparison to Marcus and his parkour capabilities. It just seemed like something that could have been duplicated from WD2 or executed better. It was nothing game-breaking but it felt like a step backwards from WD2.

I also think the limitation of weapons being used dependent on the recruited person was
warranted and a bit annoying. Let me explain what I mean. The secret agent, who had a silenced pistol, probably would have training in multiple weapons. I am ex-military and we may have had an assigned weapon, but we still touched a lot of the other weapons the military uses. In my opinion, I would have allowed them to use other weapons that others had at their disposal. Maybe making the Hitman or Agents rarer to find or more difficult to recruit. I also think you could have had a leveling system for each person you recruited, unlocking weapons and skills as they gained experience. This would have
been a challenging task for your team but the reward would have outweighed that work. Every takedown, headshot, and escaped alert would fuel those levels and unlock other things for this player. Even allowing some sort of customization to each character you have recruited increases the hurt the player felt when this person was killed in action.

Honestly, those are the main things that I felt could have truly been enhanced. Maybe adding a few more gadgets for our use would have been acceptable as well, but that can be something I look forward to in the next Watch Dogs. Speaking of such, I have a lot of ideas on the direction you could go with this next game if you ever get around to making it. 

The first thing I don't want you to do is jump deeper into sci-fi. As I stated above, the blend Ubisoft has come up with in WD3 was perfect. Cloaking, armored enemies, and drones that attack and pursue our characters are great obstacles for a game like this. We can always push this a tad bit further by adding a limited exo-suit enemy and attacking mechanical animals that can also cause each mission a bit of a headache. Obviously, this will have to be offset by more animation and tactical weapons and tools to neutralize these threats. I have faith that Ubisoft will be able to add these and other additions that don't usher the world, that has been built, into a ""Star Wars"" type realm.

I would love for Ubisoft to bring back the recruitment that was added in WD3. Just expand the occupations that the random generator is allowed to toy with and add the aforementioned leveling system so that they can start as a street mime who can only use an electric gun and get to be a capable DedSec member who can learn an artistic takedown or have tech that can EMP the entire block. Do add the ability to fully make your character the way you want, even if that means adding a character customization generator so that you can have one person, probably your first DedSec member, whom you can truly build up and design. Perhaps give that character a longer leveling up pathway who can truly be an omega agent but still require an occupation to start the character creation. If he is imprisoned, that's where your recruited members come into play. Require that he be rescued and dependent on the severity of the crime, meaning the number of stars that were accumulated before the arrest, will dictate how difficult the mission is to recover our agent. 

Vehicles in the game were serviceable but maybe add other unique modes of transportation. Skateboards seem silly but could be fun. Especially if you add that into the takedowns. Rollerblades, bikes, jet skis, and even unlockable hoverboards would be extremely interesting and add enough technology that doesn't remove the grounded feel that has been established. Weapons would fall into this as well. I would love to see an agent who is a sushi chef have the ability to do knife takedowns and knife throws for silent distant takedowns. Maybe just limit his overall weapon capability initially until he levels up enough to expand what he is capable of using.

Ubisoft was great at linking each WD to one another and I wouldn't stop doing that with the fourth edition either. Maybe have missions that mention other members of DedSec and even allow them to accompany you on specific missions. I know that could be asking a lot but it would truly set the game apart from other Ubisoft games. Even if you are just allowing them to join our character in main missions initially, it would still be amazing to have Marcus testing our skills or Aiden being our mentor. The real showstopper of linking IPs to WD was the Assassin's Creed crossover. Not only was it written very well, but it also used the London setting of past Assassin Creed to justify the existence of the location which placed the events of Assassin Creed Syndicate in the same world as WD. I think this could be pushed further with another crossover with WD and Assassin Creed and try crossing over Division, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, or even Raving Rabbids (Rabbids would be ideal for clothing designs and movie posters).

The level design for WD games is phenomenal and if you can keep that consistsstent, it will continue to be great. Not sure what location would be ideal, but I'd contemplate creating another city like was done with London, or creating a chain of islands that could allow us to have different experiences in different locations. Regardless of locale, consider expanding the headquarters for DedSec and adding some minor customizations like items you pick up or mission-specific rewards. Maybe a place where you can see all the legendary masks hanging from the wall. More interior locations would be welcome and have the player's character be able to interact with the outside environment from the interior environment. Adds a level of emergence and gives you a little more capability against the Al as they ascend on our masked player who is attempting to avoid arrest.

Co-op in the main storyline would be much appreciated but never required. Most of the time, co-op through the main story tends to make the game a lot easier to get through because you can rely on another person to revive you or guide you through the game. To counter this, up the difficult level by one when another person is added. I can imagine it will be surprising to think you can just run around hacking and killing without any strategy just because you have a friend join your game. WD is a game about planning and stealth, with the ability to go tactical when things go chaotic. Let's embrace that factor and emphasize the need to continue using your technological tools and strategic thinking.

Weapon customization should be added as well. I love changing the designs of my weapons but adding a few sights, or under barrel attachments would further flush out the gameplay. Adding a leveling function to the all the games weapons would also be outstanding. Customizing the knives, brass knuckles, and whatever else is decided on to be used would be very attractive to gamers. Reaching into the creativity to even create other tools that can be used, and customized. I would have loved to have
had a parachute with the DedSec logo on it. I spent a lot of time utilizing the construction drone that our character could ride, that I started thinking of ways to approach missions in unusual ways. Adding the approach from above would further the approach to missions. Floating in from above, dropping on top of a lookout with that takedown animation from above would be a perfect way to start some of those missions.

Honestly, I was motivated to do this because of the article I read saying that there is another Ghost Recon being created. I welcome another Ghost Recon game, especially since it was one of the first games I played way back in the day. However, I wanted to point out the potential that exist with an IP that was easily shelved. We look at the sales and the critics and tend to feel that it is a waste to take another risk on an IP that hasn't found its footing quite yet in the gaming world. Monster Hunter was the exact same way but Capcom kept pressing forward and their hard work was finally rewarded by increasing sales by roughly 17 million. Ubisoft is one of the most talented gaming companies in my lifetime, and WD is an IP I desperately want to see succeed. I just think that shelving WD indefinitely could set it back especially at a time where I believe the world could us a game that attempts to bring justice to the games society by shining a light on the corruption that we are seeing in our real life.

I truly do hope this message finds each person willing to read it well and that it gives Ubisoft a chance to think and see that fans, not just me, are passionate about this IP. 

Take care, stay blessed, and good luck with the future.

"Reminder: the Creative Director for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Jonathan Dumont, was directly named as a sexual abuser by female Ubisoft employees in 2020. Instead of being punished, he was instead rewarded by being made Director.  ","I have a feeling that this whole debacle about the black Samurai, Yasuke, is just a way for Ubisoft to deflect attention away from the fact that the Creative Director for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Jonathan Dumont, was directly named as an emotional and sexual abuser by female Ubisoft employees in 2020. 

Dumont has been accused of “verbally abusing and making sexual advances toward his colleagues, particularly women and new starters.”

A report from Game Developer into alleged abuse Ubisoft found that Dumont was, according to multiple sources, ""abusive and controlling"" and ""one of the biggest offenders"" at the company. The workers who spoke to Game Developer claim that Dumont would throw objects, punch walls, and be verbally abusive, using slurs that would reduce his targets to tears. He was even said to tell women how they should dress.

""[He] pushes people to the edge of their mental health regularly, and tries to justify his behavior by saying 'this is how you get things done.'"", said a source speaking to the publication. ""[He makes] various misogynistic and homophobic comments, and when he's called out on them will come out with defenses like 'my mother left my father when she realized she was a lesbian, so I know what I am talking about.'""

“Dumont has been responsible for many developers leaving Ubisoft altogether, due to his alleged outbursts “creating a climate of fear.”

""Dumont has been the reason [for] multiple of my colleagues leaving,” the A Better Ubisoft member tells us. “Be it because of sexual advances, belittlement, fear of him, or having seen his behaviour when in a bad mood. His outbursts have created a climate of fear known for years in the studio and failed to be acted on for a long time.”

The source also shares that while Dumont has made an effort to “improve himself”, his alleged past actions “are still very fresh in the mind of many”. As a result, “some in the Quebec studio have asked not to work on Red because of his position on the project.""

This seemingly contradicts Ubisoft's recent claims at a briefing in Paris this Thursday. ""Yes, we stumbled. And we have acknowledged that,"" said Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. ""We learned a lot along the way, and have made meaningful progress with concrete action plans.""

In a statement to TheGamer, Ubisoft provided another response from Guillemot, stating that anyone who was accused of abuse but remains at the company has been ""appropriately disciplined.""

How do you get a human response from ubisoft support ?,"There was a data breach recently that exposed some of my accounts, one of which is my ubisoft account. Someone managed to login quick enough before I could change my password, and they changed my email address (through 2-step authentication mind you), and locked me out of my account. My ubisoft account is linked to my Steam account, so I can bypass the login when playing certain games, but I just have no other way of accessing it or restoring my info. I tried reaching out to support multiple times, and every time all I get is default/bot replies after a month or two of waiting. I've always heard of ubisoft support being bad, but this is straight up disheartening (hell even EA support has been able to restore my account with a similar situation).

Why do people feel the need to complain rather than critique?,"So I just saw that Ubi posted a photo saying there are only 2 days to go for Ubsoft forward.
And the comments were riddled with common complaints rather than constructive criticism or even waiting. And if you only have things to complain about. Why comment at all? I understand people want the company to do better. But complaining saying you won’t play their games anymore isn’t going to do that. All it will do is change the Algorithm to show more of Ubi on their pages. Yea we all want AC shadows to be good. And little of us have actual hope for it. But at least waiting till we see gameplay before complaining I’m sure would really help the company and the workers to do better. Another comment was a positive one about Ghost Recon. Only for someone to reply to the comment scolding the person who’s excited about them maybe revealing the next Ghost game.. I know this post is somewhat pointless but I feel constructive criticism is always better than negative complaining. For everyone’s morale and the betterment of companies.

My ranked 3.0 system that I am programming.,"Here’s an updated look at my work-in-progress ranked 3.0 skill-based matchmaking system! 
This is my Computer Science Senior Project.  I am essentially trying to improve ranked 1.0. 
Here are some of the features of my system: 

1. Anti-boosting countermeasures. 
My algorithm allows for everyone to play together without boosting being possible.  A champ for example will never be able to play in lobbies averaging below plat 1 as an example unless both teams are boosting with the top players being near champ.  This does mean that boosters will most likely lose their games, but I have plans to manipulate MMR gains and losses for the boosting accounts to lower the non-boosting accounts at the normal rate while making accounts much lower lose less, and gain more.  This way, everyone can play with their friends while agreeing to face the consequences of playing against harder teams. 

2. Rank loss prevention. 
There is no hidden MMR or RP.  There is just MMR.  However, I have found that rank loss prevention can work in ranked 1.0 with a lot of manipulation of the ranks.  The entire point of rank loss prevention is to prevent players from quitting once they achieve their desired rank.  Rank loss prevention gives a grace period to maintain one’s rank.  This in turn does cause rank inflation, but rank loss prevention is set to only be present for the first 50 games played.  After that cut-off, it is the ranked 1.0 you know and love. You will see during the simulation that people start at 2,100 MMR instead of 2,500 MMR because of rank loss prevention’s rank inflation.  I might make it work for the first 75 or 100 games, but I am still experimenting with other parts of the algorithm. 

3. Win streak and losing streak bonuses. 
If you win 3 games in a row, you will begin to gain a bonus amount of MMR for each win.  The bonus amount you gain will increase for
each win.  This will allow people in the wrong ranks to reach their proper rank more quickly.  It will incentivize players to win more
games.  However, it will unfortunately make hackers reach higher ranks more quickly thus making the top-ranked players experience more hackers.  However, the positive is that most of the players, who are not in the top ranks, should see fewer hackers unless they are purposely losing games.  This can make hackers play in such ways that they are more likely to be detected by stat bans unless they are extra careful
in not winning too much.  This will also make people going on losing streaks lose MMR more quickly if they lose 3 or more matches in a row.

4. Minimum MMR gain is 25 MMR (not including rank loss prevention)
This is a large source of frustration for people ranked 2.0, but especially ranked 1.0. Right before ranked 2.0, Ubisoft actually implemented this, and my 
system will incorporate this as well.

5. No more losing more than you gain
This is one of the biggest player frustrations with ranked systems.  Gaining 6 MMR and losing 20 MMR is frustrating for players and it often leads to people creating Smurf accounts.  The algorithms used, such as Microsoft’s 
TrueSkill Matchmaking System take your total win rate into account for the calculations.  I believe that ranked 2.0 never resets this value as well as never resetting the rate at which hidden MMR is given or taken away.  This is what causes people to get stuck 
in their rank for multiple seasons.  

My experience with ranked 2.0:
For my siege account, I theorized that if I purposefully lost a ton of matches in my first season in ranked 2.0, my second season would allow me to be in easy lobbies to rank up to the top ranks.  The result was reaching Emerald 1 without struggle.  (I was still gaining 3x what I was losing with the lobbies remaining easy but taking Calculus 3 prevented me from reaching the ranks I could have.)  
The next season, I found that because of my high win rate, I hardly lost any hidden MMR and continued to gain a lot of hidden MMR based on the lobbies that I was playing with.  This is because hidden MMR has an algorithm like Microsoft’s TrueSkill Matchmaking System. Before I knew it, my account was playing with accounts that were not only champs but in the top 500 ranked accounts. I even saw the #6 champ account on PC. And my win rate was a 0.57 w/l that season.  I ended that season with Emerald 3 while
still gaining 55 RP and losing 11 RP solo queuing.
For the next two seasons, I have been trying to get my account back to the lobbies where I belong, which are probably gold or plat instead of top-ranked champs.  My win rate has been 0.59 for the past 172 games, and I am still facing teams of full champs regularly.  The lowest team I have faced this season was all emerald and diamond ranks.  No system should ever take this long to derank someone.  My system (without losing streaks) would have never allowed me to reach this high, and assuming ranks never reset, I would have lost −1100 MMR provided losing streaks were disabled. With losing streaks, I would have lost around −1424 MMR with my system placing me into plat 3.  If ranks reset between seasons with my system, I would have been deep into Copper V with my ranked 2.0 stats for the past 3 seasons.
Final thoughts: I want ranks to mean something again.  Right now, ranks mean very little.  I understand the idea of ranked 2.0, but the
problem is that it just does not work as it should.  As a computer science student, I believe that I can build a better system, and I believe that while it is still an early work in progress, it could be implemented as is and still be better than ranked 2.0.

If anyone has any ideas for what to add to an improved
ranked 1.0 system, I would appreciate the ideas!",3,0,RyanRetroGamer7,1714077747.0,https://v.redd.it/kczd7hf2towc1

I have an idea...,"I just had a thought, what if Ubisoft made a Rainbow Six: Vegas 3?  
inspired by and/or based on Vegas 2 and other Rainbow series games and books.

I'd be very interested if they made it an open world like Wildlands, but not as huge, but with the buildings of Vegas completely accessible (maybe not every hotels floors/rooms, but like, having specific rooms setup as safe rooms/save points and then after picking up missions it could unlock a room/suite/penthouse up to the user to continue a mission.  and have every casino, road, store, house, business mapped into the game.  maybe not a 1:1 replication of the rural surrounding area, but at least the main inner city 1:1 and with it being free roam online you could have it be live updated with casinos IRL whether they're destroyed, rebuilt, remodeled, this could even be a monetizable thing for casinos too.  They could pay to have certain things advertised in their casino etc. and that would help Ubisoft further with ongoing support for the title as a ""living city"" idea.  Think APB:Reloaded but set in Vegas City.

I understand that a 24/7 incident on the city would be... something hugely unlike TC to have written about, but the concept of being a Rainbow operator living in the City, and then called upon for various missions... I mean honestly, if CSI and CSI: Vegas has taught us anything, it's that the damn city is always dealing with cartels, murderers, and pretty much anything else under the proverbial veil of evil. 

So this is my idea, I've been a HUGE fan of Rainbow Six Vegas and Vegas 2, I would LOVE to see a reboot, revisit, continuation, but specifically, Vegas and open world.

I understand this may be dangerously close to GTA material, but let's be honest, even car manufacturers have their own versions of the same damn thing.  But what I am thinking of wouldn't be as big as GTA V, or Wildlands, just the city and a very basic rural surrounding area.  Enough to give you the feel of the city, from books, or even CSI without having to actually go to the city and.. y'know.

Yes yes, i know I've written a lot, and yes I'm a dreamer but please go easy on me, I can't imagine how epic Terrorist Hunt would be in whole city blocks of Vegas.

Downloading/Selecting Drive issue,"Is anyone else having this issue with Ubisoft Connect when downloading games? I currently have multiple drives and originally had them set up with the app, so I could install games in other locations. (e.g. South Park on C: drive, Far Cry 6 on E: drive, Assassin's Creed on D: drive, etc.) However, as it currently stands, I can no longer select other locations for my games to install. It will only install to specific folders on my ""C:"" drive and nowhere else, it only shows my desktop and User file folders. Any idea how to fix this?

AFOP and Mirage show Ubisoft's righting the ship on open world design,"It's not a huge sample size but I wanted to point out some heartening things about Ubisoft's recent design decisions compared to earlier that showed they're responding to fans

&#x200B;

A: Mirage.

&#x200B;

Complaints about previous game:Too big, too much random stuff to do, to the point where story's hard to follow, too much empty space, not enough environments to really feel assassiny in (urban, roof to roof climbs), more action focused with stealth being really freaking hard. Doesn't feel like 'assassin's game' (which is fair, it was a viking simulator, and that's fine ubi's had great success with themed open worlds).

&#x200B;

What Mirage did:

&#x200B;

Compact world where the key city feels like reasonably like a city (maybe could've been 20% bigger but no more) So much roof to roof jumping, so many stealth opportunities, more concentrated missions with side stuff being purely side, 100% an assassin game. Windy narrow roads between tall houses. Also I personally think mesopotamia is cool so I liked it for that reason

&#x200B;

(I'm not saying all ac games need to be mirage sized, but for the ac multiverse thing they're planning it makes a lot of sense. This format is very palatable. If I found out the first level from AC: Unity was being made into this-sized AC game I'd think that was \*perfect\*, for example)

&#x200B;

B: Avatar (I'm treating it as Far Cry 7 here)What Far Cry 5 complaints were:How are there this many bad guys in montana? I can't go 5 seconds before a lunatic tries to ram me off the road. Other than that good stuff maybe could be more immersioney

What FC6 did about it: Gave you a means to holster so enemies leave you alone and also some in game clothing make animals not hostile. Still high concentration but now you care less since you can holster (great stuff). You could be a little immersioney by going around repairing people's cars to make money and pretending some random spot is your character's real home. A big step forward.

How AFOP expands on that: There are simply fewer enemies, you can easily go extended periods of time without having to fight anyone, the environment traversal and resource gathering are meaningful in-game activities. It is possible to have a character that legitimately goes and collects things the tribe needs and makes food.

I've always been a fan (who else is going to make historical simulators for me?), but Valhalla was really not something I liked or wanted to see from the series, and Mirage is the most clear 'we heard you' message I can imagine. I liked FC5 just fine but did find enemy frequency and lack of peace grating (it was really hard to just fish, for example, because something would happen) and with Afop and FC6 that was resolved. AFOP feels like it's one set of mod tools away from being a full blown navi simulator (oh you want to bake? Let's do a kingdom come deliverance alchemy style baking minigame!).

I'm not telling Ubisoft to stop and that they've figured it out completely, clearly they have ideas and are iteratively implementing them and I like the direction. Now, just waiting for fpv mode for mirage now... I like walking around pretending I'm there.",5,1,DefNotaZombie,1702701805.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/18jjefu/afop_and_mirage_show_ubisofts_righting_the_ship/

Avatar Frontiers Of Pandora - no DLSS3 general performance and more AMD shenanigans?,"Hey

Started the game today sadly it doesn't have DLSS3 only FSR3 is available, and you can't use it with DLSS2.

Also FSR3 introduced stuttering for me, game actually runs better with DLSS Quality despite lower fps.

The game is super pretty though, i definitely love the look of the world though it's a demanding title. On RTX4080 i got:

4K/Native/Ultra -45fps

4K/DLSS Quality/Ultra \~70fps

4K/FSR Quality/Ultra +FSR3 \~105fps - though stuttering is deal breaker for me.

It should be said that ultra preset enables RT. Honestly considering the game looks i don't think it's that badly optimised at all. The only problem is lack of nvidia FG :/

Are you guys having issues with fsr3 ? How is your performance.

- PS prompts stutters or swaps into X360 prompt. Issue does not exist when XBOX controller is used. If consistent amongst other Dualshock users - a fix would be much appreciated.

Why I don't buy Ubisoft games anymore,"Let me preface by saying this is not an Anti-Ubisoft take.  
I used to be a huge fan of Ubisoft games and stopped buying anything from them around 2017.  
Since the very first AC and Farcry2 down to AC:Odyssey. Recently it got myself thinking ""Why did I lost all interest about Ubisoft AAA games ?""  
  
One word sums it all for me: **Surprise.** Or more accuratly, lack of it.

Everytime Ubisoft makes a new AAA I am almost confident it's going to be an Open World action RPG, with map unlocking by going to ""towers"".  
I used to really like that, spent many hours and they are quite fun game even the new ones I am sure, but I just feel like I played way too much of this gameplay loop to keep buying more of it.

I would expect that from the same IP, but I feel like Farcry, AC, Breakpoint, etc all have the same ""feel"" with a different map and main gameplay mechanic (guns, swords etc). But they all ""feel"" the same imo.

Think of the changes between Farcry 1 (I know Ubi is not the dev), Farcry 2 and Farcry 3. All thoose game were very different and caught me by surprise back then. Farcry 4 and 5 all left more or less a twist on FC3.

To sum up, I am an adult now, and I don't have much free time to play like before, and I don't feel like spending that time playing the ""same game"" (yes, this is an exaggeration of my feeling) over and over.

I don't know if orthers quite old folks have the same feeling as I do.

And I wish on the AAA space, Ubi creatives had more freedom like they ocasionnally showcase on smaller titles.",7,39,East-Cat4535,1728904305.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1g3d8oo/why_i_dont_buy_ubisoft_games_anymore/

Lost access to my e-mail address -what to do next?,"UPDATE: 
I got them to change my Email address! I answered to their standard response providing further evidence that it is my account. I sent pictures of my account opened with a verification of my name on a piece of paper. I sent them my ip-address (I know not the best idea) and a picture of my id with only the information relevant shown (I know even more risky, but I was desperate). 
Lust but not least, I threatened them to take legal actions if they don't approve my request. After a couple of minutes I got a response, that they approved the request to change my email! 


So my situation is as followed:

I lost access to my E-Mail address used for my Ubisoft account (its a longer story, however i still have access to old E-Mails from the time i still had access). I wrote the support, to change the E-Mail, i gave them multiple proofs that i own this account (multiple keys i used, transaction numbers from games i directly bought from ubisoft, etc.). However, today i got a standard e-mail that all of this does not count and they won't change the e-mail address. 

In the meantime i found an e-mail from the time i activated 2FA with the 6 one-time codes to login, so i manged to get access back (in a way). This might be the reason support denied my request since they saw the account being actively used. 

Now i have access to my account but with reduced security (because i needed to deactivate 2FA) but i still can't change my e-mail address on my own (the link is sent to the old e-mail address). So do you have any ideas what to do now? Write again to the support and hope that this time i don't get a standard rejection e-mail?

Did Connect sell me an incorrect version of Outlaws? I have a question for people with working PC updates.,"I've been struggling on PC to get my copy of Outlaws to update. I noticed a few strange things this morning:

  
\* The Connect store shows other games I've bought as ""already owned"". However it doesn't say that for Outlaws and will happily sell me the game a second time.

\* The date under my Outlaws tile is 8/29 but the actual (non-early-access) game shipped (and was purchased) on 8/30

I'm wondering if they sold me some orphaned SKU instead of the one they're actually updating.

My question for folks that are getting hot patches and updates: Do you see 8/29 on the game tile? Does the store say ""Already owned"" when you look at this title?

Changing the Close Behavior on PC,"TLDR: To modify the close behavior, edit the settings.yaml file (located at C:\\Users\\{yourPCUsername}\\AppData\\Local\\Ubisfoft Game Launcher\\settings.yaml), and change the following setting from:

    user:
         closebehavior: CloseBehavior_Close 

to:

    user:
         closebehavior: CloseBehavior_Minimize

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have spent hours trying to figure this out, and I stumbled upon a thread mentioning the settings.yaml file (located in C:\\Users\\{yourPCUsername}\\AppData\\Local\\Ubisfoft Game Launcher\\settings.yaml) for a different reason.

I just reinstalled Windows 11 on a new NVME, so I just reinstalled UbisoftConnect, and it asked me what I wanted to do when I clicked the ""Close"" button in the top right hand corner of the window the first time I launched it. I choose to exit the application, as I figured it would minimize automatically when launching a game. When it didn't, I clicked the close icon and it immediately closed my game as well as the launcher. Turns out this PoS software is useless and incapable of running in a manor that makes any normal sense. Anyway. 

In the settings.yaml file, all the way at the bottom, is a setting called 

    user: 
         closebehavior : ...

that was set to CloseBehavior\_Close, I changed it to CloseBehavior\_SysTray as I did not know what the proper value was supposed to be, because you know, there is no documentation at all anywhere for this app. I saved the file, and launched the app. It immediately changed it's value to CloseBehavior\_Undefined, and presented me with the pop up asking me what I wanted to do when closing the application. I chose Minimize to system tray, and the value updated in the settings file to CloseBehavior\_Minimize.

The app now minimizes to the system try when I try to close it.",3,0,averajoe77,1725203354.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1f6gp86/changing_the_close_behavior_on_pc/

Game launch crashes and resetting passwords is a nightmare,"Okay, honestly I don’t even know where to begin. So I recently came back to playing PC which I was unable to do for the last 6 months and now I wanted to play Frontiers of Pandora. So far so good. Had to reset passwords cause I forgot my previous one and wrote the new one down and told the Pc to remember my login. 

Did update the game afterwards.

Came to start FOP…. And it crashes. Cloud Sever can’t be synchronized and when I tried skipping that step it didn’t work. Try it again 20 times and it keeps crashing. At this point I’m annoyed. So I checked the installed game data for errors. When that was done, I launched it again. And it crashed …. Because after I started it an add window for the new Assassin‘s Creed game that’s gonna be released in November pops open. I try it again. Same thing happens. I try it another 20 times, disconnect and reconnect from the internet, use a differ WiFi source etc. Any attempt to play offline fails. I am foaming from my mouth. After half an hour the game starts. I play it just fine.

Next day, same shit happens. The program keeps saying that it can’t update cloud data which is weird because I have a stable internet connection. Anyway, after another half an hour of restarting my pc, the internet, uplay and whatever gods approval I need for a bloody game to launch. It does. I play in piece. 

Today, I was logged out of my Ubisoft account. I put in my email and password; it doesn’t start. I put it in another few times, it doesn’t start. I check if I have the right password, which I have because I wrote it down when I resettled it. I can’t login to my account because of a connection error, which again is weird because I have stable WiFi. 

I try to reset my password again. Get the email, reset it, generate a new password and copy it via shortcut…. Or. So. I. Thought. It didn’t copy. I try resetting again. The box that I have to check to verify I am not a robot and therefore attempt to resent my password is now loading for half an hour. I get that this one is on me and my stupidity but the constant crashing has ticked me off a few too many times the past days.

What do I do? I cannot log into my account at the moment, I cannot reset my password at the moment, Ubisoft has no service hotline. What do I do? Help? Do I just wait? Do I complain?

The problem is that my Gmail account was deleted for no reason, and I could not restore access to Ubisoft and other services.

Ubisoft Support ,"To all of those who are currently trying to deal with support to recover accounts stolen from you or locked away because of a hacker. I bring hope 

My account was hacked on May 19th. I sent in a ticket on the 20th and finally received a reply today. After going back and forth a couple times over the course of about an hour or two they were able to recover my account and I have changed everything back over to my personal accounts 

The hacker was actively playing xdefiant and rainbow six on the account, they even spent all of my renown and bought/sold some items on the marketplace. Unfortunately support is not able to reverse those transactions but I'm just glad to have the account back

If you are currently struggling, just stay patient and check your email each day. Took them 17 days for the initial response but after that they responded to each email within a half hour
