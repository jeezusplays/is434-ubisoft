## Season 2.0

Seasons were introduced to The Division 2 in March 2020 with the release of Warlords of New York. They have become a key aspect of the endgame, however, after four years, this model has reached its limit. To prepare for the game's future, they needed to reevaluate the season model, update it, and equip the game with the right tools to make each season truly unique. 

TU 22 & Seasons 2.0 offers an exciting mix of new gameplay elements, new story, and rewards, all presented in a fresh way that allows for greater creativity and surprise. The main idea behind Seasons 2.0 is to break away from the current seasonal model by transforming the entire experience. 

&nbsp;

### Seasonal Journey Missions

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season’s content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

### Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

&nbsp;

### Manhunt Scouts

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

&nbsp;

### Seasonal Modifiers

=> [Season Modifiers]( https://i.imgur.com/XfduRhn.png)

The Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience.

The modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges.

&nbsp;

###Season Pass 

The optional Season Pass is available for all The Division 2 players starting at Level 1, priced at 1000 Premium Credits ($9.99 or your regional equivalent) in the in-game store and does not require ownership of the Warlords of New York DLC. While accessible from Level 1, please note that the rewards remain locked until Level 40.

Additionally, players can opt for the Premium+ option, available for 3000 Premium Credits ($29.99 or your regional equivalent), which bundles the Premium Season Pass with multiple rewards, offering even greater value.

&nbsp;

=> [SeasonPass]( https://i.imgur.com/BurFjAY.png)

&nbsp;

Players with the Season Pass can gain access to the following premium track rewards: 

*   10 gear dyes
*   10 weapon skins 
*   2 outfits 
*   2 new Prestige Arm Patches

&nbsp;

Moreover, players can earn 400 Virtual Currency by progressing through the Season Pass on the premium track.

But that's not all! Free players now can receive cosmetics in the Season Pass. The free track includes 1 outfit and 1 weapon skin, allowing every Agent to gear up and stand out in the streets of D.C.

##Balancing Pass

###Rework

**Sledgehammer** - Weapon Talent

Dealing damage with a grenade applies a mark on target. Targets with marks will take **15%(20%) more damage to armor** and have a -20% movement speed. Mark disappears after 10 seconds.  
  
_Previously: Dealing damage with a grenade applies a mark on target. Targets with marks will take 30% more damage to armor and have a -20% movement speed. Mark disappears after 10 seconds._

&nbsp;  

**Mosquito Song** - Exotic Pistol

Hitting an enemy applies a stack. Stacks are shared between players. At **5** stacks, the enemy will forcefully target the last player to apply a stack for 5s **and take 25% more damage to armor**. Stacks deplete every 5s. Activating the effect on an enemy will remove all stacks from other enemies.

&nbsp;

### Balancing - Weapons & Talents, Gear & Brand Sets, Exotic Weapons & Gear

With the introduction of Seasons 2.0, which brings new features like Modifiers, Scouts, Priority Objectives and the Seasonal Journey, we’ve taken a fresh approach to balancing, aiming to give different playstyles more distinct personalities.

This update will address a wide range of elements, including various weapon categories, Exotic weapons and gear, weapon mods, talents, and gear sets.

&nbsp;

### Loot Pool Update

In TU22, a fresh batch of Named Weapons will be added to the loot pool for missions and mission bosses. While the original loot tables remain unchanged, they now offer additional opportunities to obtain these new items.

Although these weapons have a higher drop rate, they are not guaranteed rewards and may require multiple attempts to acquire. The likelihood of these weapons dropping increases with the difficulty level of the mission.

These new loot drop chances are exclusively available for characters at level 40 or above and are limited to regular versions of missions - they do not apply to ""invaded"" missions.

#Shades of Red

Year 6 Season 2: Shades of Red is marking the start of a new seasonal journey. With Aaron Keener in custody at the White House, he aims to strike a deal with The Division. Before Agents can learn what he knows, they have to secure the other members of Keener's team, starting with Theo Parnell.

##SEASONS 2.0

###Seasonal Journey

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season's content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

###Seasonal Modifiers

=> [Season Modifiers]( https://i.imgur.com/XfduRhn.png)

The Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience: 

*   **Global Modifiers** set the overall theme of the season and are active at all times while the system is enabled, affecting the core gameplay loop. 
    *   This season, the theme is ""range."" The Global Modifier, ""Point Blank,"" grants a bonus damage based on distance from enemies. 
*   **Active Modifiers** function like ""ultimate"" abilities, giving your character a short burst of power. 
    *   Players can choose from a selection of Active Modifiers, but only one can be equipped at a time. This season, they manipulate the range zones set by the Global Modifier. 
*   **Passive Modifiers** work in conjunction with the Global Modifier, adding extra bonuses. 
    *   Players can equip up to three Passive Modifiers simultaneously. In the first season, these modifiers provide additional benefits based on the range zones from the Global Modifier. 
*   **Hostile Modifiers:** These represent how the enemies adapt to your new abilities. 
    *   As players progress through the season, enemies will gradually gain new abilities linked to specific enemy types, forcing you to use the Global, Passive, and Active Modifiers strategically to counter them. 

The modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges. 

&nbsp;

###Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

Players can choose from three objectives, selecting one based on limited information such as duration, reward category, and mission type. Once a selection is made, it is locked in, and the full details of the objective and its rewards will be revealed.

If none of the objectives appeal to the player, the system allows for rerolls and has an Abandon Objective feature. Players can earn reroll points by completing Priority Objectives, with a maximum of three rerolls stored at any time.

There is no limit to the number of Priority Objectives a player can complete, and rewards include XP, Season Pass XP, items, resources, and passive modifier unlocks.  

&nbsp;

###Manhunt Scouts

=> [Parnell Manhunt](https://i.imgur.com/khEGjlR.jpeg)

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

Each week, players can tackle a Scout, which consists of three different activities. These activities will vary, and players must solve a small riddle to complete each one. Activities should be completed in order, and once all three are finished, players will receive the Scout Reward.

Once all activities in a Scout are completed, players will receive a bigger reward, including a unique collectible. However, new Scouts cannot be accessed until the current one is completed.

By the end of the season, completing all Scouts unlocks the Manhunt Climax Mission, and finishing that unlocks the Master Climax Mission, so make sure to stay on track each week.

&nbsp;

##UPDATED LOOT POOL

### Named Weapons

In TU22, a fresh batch of Named Weapons will be added to the loot pool for missions and mission bosses. While the original loot tables remain unchanged, they now offer additional opportunities to obtain these new items.

These new loot drop chances are exclusively available for characters at level 40 or above and are limited to regular versions of missions - they do not apply to ""invaded"" missions.

3,1g6zchu,AUSLC,1729305762.0,Possible solution for low quality textures on PC (Nvidia GPU),2,1,"Like some other people on this subreddit I had poor qualty textures on many models in game. I could not find a solution but after about 70 hours in game I managed to get all textures to load in properly. The key seems to be setting AA to enhance application and 4x in the nvidia control panel. I also turned on anisotropic filetring to 16x, AA - transparency to 4x, AA- gama correction to on and texture filtering to high quality. I do believe AA to 4x is the key setting. In particular, setting it to 4x as opposed to 2x makes a dramtic difference to the quality of some armors, like the cloak for Byzantine armor from the Ireland DLC.

I am assuming at some point in the past 4 years Ubisoft accidentally introduced a bug when optimising that made textures on some set ups fail to load in. the NVCP AA is MSAA so I believe my GPU is essentially supersampling the textures, reversing this optimisation bug.

Please note I am playing at 4k, ultra settings, 100% resolution and no FSR.

EDIT: It is also necessary for negative LOD bias to be set to allow.

4,1g76k2q,ToVAidk,1729336184.0,I like Ubisoft,6,38,"Ubisoft gets a shit ton of hate. Their third party launcher sucks and they use some monetisation tactics that nobody wants to see. It's fair to say they're not always great.

Despite that, a large chunk of my favorite games are made by Ubisoft. In fact, a very disproportionate amount. For almost every game publisher who's games I have in my library there's about 2 to 0 games I actually like from them. There's upwards of 10 games I like made by Ubisoft, and a couple I love. In fact, the game I've played the most is from Ubisoft.

I've also really never felt like I had to buy in-game purchases to enjoy the games. They're always just extras.

When they make mistakes, they often try to fix them. Ghost Recon Breakpoint is a great example. But they've also changed the parkour in Mirage after a mod that made it better came out. And they've said they want to improve the stealth in Star Wars Outlaws, after it received a lot of critique.

Nobody, and I mean nobody, makes worlds like Ubisoft does. Their scale, beauty and attention to detail is unmatched. And they are exceptionally consistent in the quality of their worlds, music and writing (mostly).

I'm not posting this to change anyone's mind. Just to balance out the negativity a bit. To me it's clear that the games Ubisoft makes can only be made by passionate people who want to make a fun, immersive game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1g76k2q/i_like_ubisoft/
5,1g6f4g7,vzb227,1729248435.0,"Why is it, that lately all the skins are unbelievably hideous?",394,70,"I'm an old player, I started playing at skull rain. and I know that a lot has changed, which is normal for any game that's been around this long. I've always preferred the REAL tactical, or at least tacticool looks, which of course is just a matter of taste, but it really fits ( seemed to fit) the game better than all the cartoon looks. So I was already shedding tears at Pizza Mozzie, but at least it was a well done look, it didn't fit the game at all, but at least I didn't get visual brain cancer when I looked at it. When they introduced battlepass, it started off strong, with clothes that matched the game and characters.

https://preview.redd.it/g4whn1fcuhvd1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=b00e99a3bbc1a4908279f5c3bc06741648a4dc9b

And then over time it started to loosen up, and clothes that were less meaningful but still showed quality work started to appear. 

https://preview.redd.it/a0a59lnguhvd1.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=da8ad3aebc71355a19fd04a74ecaf3cd7eba1413

But in the meantime, the worst period of randomly re-purposed clothes started, the ""fuck it, let's put all sorts of mismatched but at least ugly colours and shapes on the basic clothes"" period.

[The F is this?](https://preview.redd.it/seiya0xluhvd1.png?width=434&format=png&auto=webp&s=96f53863da912ef81cb34a81c3f8d7f48381cd76)

In the current battlepass, there is only a single 3D skin, and even that is just a headgear, everything else is worthless garbage. 

[What is it even trying to represent? It doesn't look like anything](https://preview.redd.it/7a16u8zpuhvd1.png?width=398&format=png&auto=webp&s=9baf0108942cc61ace41dda3533763561a875985)

Not to mention the unnecessary backgrounds and operator cards that fill the battlepasses. And it's not about ""grown ass man crying about having historically incorrect motifs in his unrealistic game"", it's just that all these mismatch clothes are ugly and lazy. I've done my fair share of 3d modeling and texture application, and while it's not an easy task, I think a triple A, excuse me, ""Quadruple A"" studio should bring it up a level, because right now these skins look like a cheap AI just randomly throwing colors on top of each other and then putting it into the battlepass. But I ask you, is it worth it? I understand that probably 80% of the money from the battlepass goes into C suit pockets, but wouldn't it be more worth it for them to make outfits that people want and might actually spend money on? I am a grown man with enough spending money and with very poor financial decisions. Without thinking, I would spend a lot of money on (otherwise pointless) things like good looking skins. But Ubisoft doesn't seem to want my money. Especially as they are going bankrupt after the many ""Quadruple A"" failures of the last few years. I don't know what I want with this post, and I know that there are many things in the game that need more urgent improvement, but if Ubisoft can't even keep the milking cow part of the game going, what do we expect from them?

Or am I living in a totally different world and people like what they're putting in the game these days?

6,1g20lcn,Financial-Host-7587,1728741151.0,Game is breaking all of a sudden ,3,3,"I started playing for the first time ac origins (always on the same laptop) two weeks ago. My laptop is nothing crazy it got a Ryzen 5 5625U with Radeon Vega 7 graphics and 16gb of ram. I was using the software ""lossless scaling"" to be able to run the game at 1080p high settings and it ran pretty well (considering my laptop) at around 35/40 fps what is amazing. I had already 36h in the game so I had played quite some time already. For the past few days tho, every time I tried to play it the game breaks (not even sending a crash report but just stopping and not going anywhere) and I have to switch to task manager and end the task to actually get off the game (because force quitting Ubisoft doesn't work). I've tried cleaning my fans, lower graphic quality and resolution and even installing and reinstalling the game. Nothing worked. Can someone give me a clue of what is going on or what I could do. I've tried playing other games like 2k23, R6 siege and even ac syndicate ran like butter (for syndicate I used the same software I use for origins and there has never been a problem with it).

Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is one of the first games I ever played. It was magical, like a playable Disney movie (back when Disney was good) with engaging action and amazing unforgettable music from Stuart Chatwood.

The first few Splinter Cell games were always captivating to me. I'm stealthy at heart, and the whole secret agent spy theme always appealed greatly to me. Using all the cool gadgets and sneaking past enemies (and shooting when you have to!) was always a blast. There are some elements of the older SC games that haven't aged well at all (needing to stand still for 5 seconds to aim at a light on the ceiling only to miss anyways...) but for their time, they were great games.

And do I even need to bring up Assassin's Creed? I remember being a kid looking at gaming magazines advertising AC2, and ***I remember being hyped about the fact that Ezio could swim.*** Like, that just blew my mind. And actually playing the game was incredible. To this day, AC1 and 2 STILL have the best parkour in the entire series. Wtf, Ubisoft? You already had a high quality parkour system with great skill expression back then. As someone who's been with Ubisoft and Assassin's Creed LITERALLY since the BEGINNING, it has been HEARTBREAKING to see each game after AC2 just slowly killing the parkour system. One by one, slowly, worse and worse. God it's so disgusting.

And, well, I guess that was a rather natural segue into why I'm now *happy* that Ubisoft is going down the drain.

I'm not even going to start about what's stupid about AC Shadows (I don't know where to start. Just yikes all around.) but in general, Ubisoft's monetization has become extremely unfun. Back in the day I actually **didn't really mind** buying a cute cosmetic pack here and there. I liked the flaming horse armor in Origins. But it's a corporate joke that some of the pre-purchase packs for these games are exceeding $100 just to play the game ""early"". That's a lie and a marketing term. You're making people who **purchased your product** play it **later** because they didn't pay as much as you wanted them to. You don't incentivize people to pay more by **locking the game away from them you dolt,** you incentivize people to pay more by **providing them with greater service.**

Seeing the parkour system in AC slowly die, seeing the joke of the way their games are monetized in the last decade, and seeing their narcissistic egos falling apart in their Twitter comments when Elden Ring was new and successful have all contributed to my schadenfreude at Ubisoft's current failing state.

I'm sad, but also happy, because you aren't the Ubisoft I remember. You aren't the same quality studio that made those incredible games. You are incredibly out of touch and I am disappointed in you. I also feel bad because I'm looking forward to the Splinter Cell remake and I want it to be good and successful, but at the same time I want the studio itself to fail because they deserve it.

9,1fscd1h,rudra285,1727637660.0,"After years of playing Ubisoft games, I gave up on Ubisoft.",365,237,"I have many Ubisoft games in my catalogue starting from AC black flag. I've played unity, syndicate, origins, Odyssey and Valhalla. Origins being my favorite in the recent Ancient civilization games.

Also played all the watch dogs games. But I can't keep playing Ubisoft games anymore.

Even with heavy discount, they feel like such a chore with the insane grinding. Valhalla broke me, so much grinding and so boring. At one point I stopped having fun and I gave up on the game, WD legion too felt so stale and not fun to play, I finished it but I'll never play it again. WD 2 was so fun.

Now it just feels like Ubisoft is pumping out games just to reach a certain financial goal. They stopped innovating the gameplay and now every single IP feels like same game with a different coat of paint.

Every game has the same stealth mechanic. Every game is monetized our of the ass. Even for AC which is now primarily a RPG series. The fun of RPG is not even present properly, in an RPG I want to feel immersed with various different branches, endings, ways to play which incentives multiple play throughs but after finishing an AC game I feel drained and don't want to play it again. It doesn't give me any reason for me to play again.

Where as CDPR even cyberpunk, I would play again, with different endings, different builds, different relationships. At the very least because the gameplay loop is engaging, I don't have to grind for hours. Same for the witcher, even though they are 2 different IPs and both being RPGs, they are different experiences. The DLC expands and innovates on the base game too.

Sucker Punch has very diverse IPs from Sly cooper which is a platformer stealth to infamous which is a pure open world power fantasy to the Ghost series.

In conclusion, I'm done with Ubisoft now until I see a actual effort to innovate in their games.

P.S. Imo since Origins came out, the AAA games quality bar has reached so high to where Ubisoft simply can't compete anymore. We have bangers every year like elden ring, God of War, Baldur's Gate, RDR 2, Alan Wake and all these games take time to cook, meanwhile Ubisoft out here pumping out new AC games on a pretty much yearly basis with same old formula like a making new iPhones with minimal new upgrades borrowed from other games but doesn't improve on it and I don't think Ubisoft understands why the games I mentioned and the features they borrow from other games were actually so popular and hits with the gamers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fscd1h/after_years_of_playing_ubisoft_games_i_gave_up_on/
10,1frjbm5,zaza991988,1727544179.0,Ubisoft make me sad,69,93,"The obligatory thing to say is that I am not a hater, and I own so many Ubisoft games from their major franchise (AC, Ghost Recon, Far Cry, watchdogs, Prince of Persia, The Crew, The Division...)

In the last few years, you have noticed a drop in the gameplay quality of their games. I have a tolerance for long games if they are well-made. I truly enjoyed AC: odyssey and considered it as one of my favorite Ubisoft games (AC: odyssey should have been the start of another separate franchise that focuses more on mythology-based RPG and not an assassin game), i liked Ghost Recon Wildlands and Breakpoint (after the patches). I enjoyed Far Cry 6 and the division series.

Ubisoft art direction and environmental artists are truly some of the best in the industry and capable of releasing amazing-looking games that run well year after year. The cities they create feel very authentic.

Ubisoft also has good gameplay systems, from how the weapons feel and perform, to how the combat flows, to the additional tools they give you to take several scenarios. to usually decent progression system that let you feel more powerful at times goes on

The stories they tell aren't bad, but aren't great either, almost every Ubisoft game follows the same formula, a starting locked-off area that teaches you game mechanics, then three (or more) independent separate areas with separate stories and characters that you can take in any order, and then a final confrontation.

If I have to summarize what makes games turn away from Ubisoft games are constant small frustrations that eventually add up to makes the game feels like a chore to play. Let’s give you some examples.

you can take a look at Far Cry 6 with repeated quest design, and removal of leveling up perks instead of sticking them to clothing pieces each scattered on a different part of the map behind puzzles or enemy camps. Or the not-present main villain, or the fact best gear is hidden behind a paywall.

Almost every Ubisoft game's best weapons and abilities are hidden behind a paywall. Their games are built around frustrating/edging you enough to shell out extra in-game monetization for a game that you already paid for. I am here wondering how much extra money are they making in these MTX console/PC games ? 

Every Ubisoft game must have a merchant that doesn’t take the regular currency, but only takes a premium currency that either has to grind for an unreasonably long time with random weekly reward.

Or selling a complete edition or ultimate edition of the game that doesn’t contain all the content, and you expected to fork extra money on that.

Not to mention the online requirements for single-player games, live services for most Ubi games and finally removing content from your library that you paid for.

All these frustrations add up to gamers automatically feeling like they are about to get screwed because Ubisoft has done so repeatedly in the past.

Some Ubisoft games feel off is that in most cases gameplay systems don't work well together.

In LoZ:Botw almost every upgrade is behind a temple puzzle, but these puzzles are diverse enough with a separate theme that allows challenge your problem-solving skills, different combat skills, timing skills, or creativity and the game gives you all the tools to do that early on.  AC: Valhalla obviously tries to copy the idea of a puzzle behind weapon and upgrade but you end up with a badly designed puzzle that is either not properly introduced, or just looking around to find an opening from an angle to shoot a lock so you can enter a door to shoot another lock to get to a lame rewards (ingots). And the best/coolest rewards (weapons/armors) are hidden behind a paywall. What makes matters worse is that you will spend more time than you like just to find the angle from where you want to shoot because of the game's dense geometry and the art style. Or the never-ending skill tree that is filled with +1% damage while (random action)…. It just feels disrespectful of your time. Even Immortal: fenyx rising suffers from a similar puzzle design but to a slightly lesser degree. These games just feel constantly frustrating you so go and buy ingots from the store using real world money

Or stealth section in star wars outlaws where you don’t have any stealth tools and broken line of sight system.

Or shallow characters and repetitive missions in every Ubisoft game that the writers of the game think they are amazing and cool.

And this makes me sad. Most Ubisoft games aren’t bad, they are a company that targets a 7/10 or 8/10 game that hasn’t released anything a real GOTY in the last decade. It feels like maybe if they spend more time polishing the gameplay systems, better writing,  and better quest design they can end up with solid games every time because you can see the potential. Ubisoft feels like the smart kid in highschool class, who is set to do the bare minimum to get a passing grading that you know can ace the exam if they make the effort, but after a long time doing these, you started wondering if that can even recover because of their bad habits. That is why their games always go on sale soon after launch because no one wants to pay the full price for a game they have played before with a different skin on top, especially when you know another one in releasing in few month that will end up a similar experience. The best way to enjoy a Ubisoft game is to take a long break between their franchise and that what I think instinctively we are doing as gamers.

In fact, it kinda reminds me of Sam's Penthouse/Battery suit from SCCT.  I didn't find most of the unlockable 4E suit aesthetics appealing, so I'd be up for wearing this suit as a change of pace.  Wouldn't it be funny in-lore, if Sam intentionally dressed up like his elite enemies to mess with them?  Perhaps a minor detection bonus could be added, where NPCs need to see him closer to realize he's not one of them.

Second, I think Ubisoft was quite inconsistent with the Voron levels and enemy outfits.  You see, absolutely none of the Voron suits from Conviction were used despite two Briggs missions taking place at a Voron station in Bangladesh and a Voron blacksite in Russia.  What did I find in those missions?  Thermal goggle equipped commandos... dressed exactly like these Blacklist guys... with the same Iranian accents and the same guns from the main campaign.  It wouldn't have killed Ubisoft to bring back some of Kestrel's suits from Conviction to flesh out what Voron's agency looks like outside of his perspective.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1flu0fa

There is a sense of impending doom surrounding Ubisoft that you may have seen in the news. I’m genuinely concerned that the entire company may not survive.

As fans of Anno, we need Ubisoft Mainz—formerly known as BlueByte—to persevere. The only franchise still thriving and capable of delivering quality Anno titles should not be affected. I hope a capable parent company acquires them and protects the IP when the crisis begins.

14,1flrkl8,Euro_Twunk,1726881048.0,Why is AC viewed unfavourably among certain segments of the wider gaming population?,21,96,"I’ve only really started paying attention to gaming discourse over the last year or two, but I get the impression that a large amount of the wider gaming population, outside of the traditional AC player base, looks down on the franchise.

Now whether or not this is warranted when you consider all 13 titles—and putting aside any separate debates about Ubisoft as a company, or the recent Shadows controversies—I’d like to get a better idea of where and when this perception truly originated. Because while the series has certainly had its low points, I also think it’s produced some really good and unique titles over the years.

I don’t think Valhalla was a very good game (no offence to anyone who likes it), and I hear a lot of criticism levied towards it in particular. But did this really just start with the last major game, or does it run deeper? (Not counting Mirage, which was produced by a side studio and sold at a discounted price, since they were very upfront that it would be a smaller game using older tech.)

After the success of Black Flag, obviously Unity’s completely broken state on release marked a low point for Ubi which drew a lot of attention, and which Syndicate didn’t do much to quell. But then Origins was a genuinely brilliant game, and while I was taking a break from gaming at the time of its release, I understand now that it was actually really warmly-received (and continues to be looked upon favourably).

Afterwards we had Odyssey, and while I don’t think it’s a very good AC game for breaking a lot of the conventions that were deeply ingrained into the series’ identity, I do believe it is a genuinely great ARPG that refined some of the changes Origins implemented, and is a blast if you approach it as such—hell, it was even nominated for GOTY alongside games like RDR2 and God of War (and I’m not saying Odyssey reaches quite those heights, but still). It also sold really well, introducing the franchise to a new demographic, and paving the way for the monumental sales that Valhalla would eventually have as its immediate successor.

As for Mirage, while I personally love it and was prepared to encounter the game’s limitations that were outlined well before release, if you’re not in the AC bubble you may not have gotten that memo and just said “oh look a new AC game, let’s try it”. In which case I understand why it may not have improved your view of the series so much: it was a game made for a very specific niche of the player base that was never going to appeal to everyone, and while I think it held potential and made players like me much more hopeful for the future of the series, I could see why someone going in blind may have expected more from a AAA developer in the modern gaming landscape.

So ultimately, where does that perception originate in 2024? Do we think it comes largely from Valhalla and/or Mirage—with the former now being the last major entry in 4 years? Did it just never fully fade after Unitygate? Could it be due to the relative inconsistencies in quality between games? Could it be a spillover of the divisions in the player base itself? Or is it something else entirely—I’m just spitballing here?

I ask because with AC recently in the spotlight again, I’ve seen a lot of these views resurface among certain sections of gamers. And as someone who genuinely loves this series and wants to see it improve and continue to grow (emphasis on improve), I’d like to get a better understanding of why that perception seems to be so widespread--and why, in my opinion, some of the higher points of the series may be overlooked today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1flrkl8/why_is_ac_viewed_unfavourably_among_certain/
15,1flb1b5,Gibster457,1726836045.0,I wish rogue and maybe even Unity and AC 3 could have been remade and overhauled,12,12,"I'm not talking about a remaster I mean remaking and reinterpreting the games gameplay and narrative wise. All three games could have had such potential story wise and tie into each other in an interesting way that I think if reinterpreted with better writing and cohesion could be amazing. In particular I want to see a more morally corrupt Shay of whom maybe his ego or naivity caused the Lisbon earthquake instead of the creed's incompetence. Rogue could have been a great opportunity to play as the villain but ubisoft instead wrote the templars and brotherhood way out of character in the process of choosing the safest option by making Shay mostly a good guy. Also Connor and Arno could have been written to be more interesting but that's just me and if you like said characters and find them interesting then more power to you.

As for gameplay Rogue in particular could benefit from an overhaul, while it did add some great features such as the possibility of being boarded it all felt too similar to black flag and it felt as if the world was too centered around that aspect of which can be seen within the river valley map of which albeit beautiful is really inaccurate to the actual geography and kinda felt like it was changed too much to suit the gameplay that I personally found it less immersive. They could keep the naval combat to the North Atlantic and maybe have the river valley be an area you can explore via horse like the Levant between all the cities in AC1 albeit with more locations and things to do.

As for Unity it no doubt had great gameplay but I feel it was held back by the flaws in game design and glitches that still to some extent haunt it to this day. If rebuilt from the ground up and properly quality assessed the gameplay would be some of the best ever seen in an AC gameplay. AC3 is generally good as far as gameplay but with modern game design it could be even better, maybe more expansion into the naval combat and the frontier. The possibilities are endless. 

I know to some extent this all would prolly be unnecessary and will never happen but it just pains me seeing the untapped potential in these games.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1flb1b5/i_wish_rogue_and_maybe_even_unity_and_ac_3_could/

I'd like to make a post where everyone can share their thoughts about the new patch's (Y9S3) DirectX 12 update and Vulkan remove.

I played siege with Vulkan for a very long time on all of my previous setups and on the recent too. With the new update i had to make a decision to change for DX12 with keeping all the GPU specified features ingame settings like (NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR) or NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency settings OR change to the old DX11 and losing all the settings what may reduces the GPU's performance without these settings.  
I use DX11 now, because the DX12 is cut my FPS to half and it has microlags, they will fix the microlags for sure with micropatches in a week but it wont solve the huge FPS issues.  
Here is my recent setup:  
Razer Blade 15 2022 Intel 12800H + RTX 3070 Ti + 16GB RAM  
FPS numbers in the game with PRO settings (everything on Low except shadow and LOD quality):  
DX12: around 145 FPS

DX11:  Fix 240 FPS (I capped it to the monitor because of G-Sync, but without it it can reach 260 FPS)

I know its practice mode, but i have the same numbers in normal game too.

17,1f8ayg3,brodiebradley51,1725396663.0,Rainbow Six Siege - Ubisoft Failed The Game,372,135,"Coming off reports that Ubisoft’s stocks are at a 10-year low, XDefiant on the brink of cancellation, drama around AC:Shadows, Star Wars outlaws being so poor and Siege seemingly getting more boring each year, it highlights how poor they’ve handled this game. 

Siege is still their Magnus opus and their big money maker. While it’s approaching 10 years in age, it is still Ubisofts big title. 

This is why I just don’t get why they ever cut the frequency of new content from the game so drastically. The game was booming when we had two new ops, new guns, new skins, new maps etc…yet they chose to scale back that content so drastically for seemingly one reason; less money was being given to the game thus less devs and the less content we got.

No big company would butcher the ‘enjoyment’ that came with every season so drastically especially if it’s still their MAIN game. They lost the game’s mainstream appeal, the dedicated player-base and importantly the interest.

If they kept up with the content quality and quantity, but pushed ahead with the battlepass, elites etc the game would be making money hand-over-foot for Ubisoft.

They clearly thought XDefiant was where they were going to make huge money and now it’s on the brink of cancellation.

Ubisoft should’ve kept the money and resources on Siege and kept it the juggernaut it was. The least they could do now is push ahead with adding more content back into Siege. More devs, more money and importantly a return on vision for the game.

The game will repay once popularity increases but it won’t unless content ramps back up again. While it’s a 10yr old game it’s still as unique as any shooter out there and could regain mainstream appeal with improvements to content added.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1f8ayg3/rainbow_six_siege_ubisoft_failed_the_game/

A few years back before they went BIG with every single game, all their stories were fully mocapped like Watch dogs 1 & 2 - AC Unity-Syndicate- Origins.

All these games had great stories and cutscenes for that, they felt high quality and high budget. Since they’re making bigger open worlds, I get they can’t mocap everything so why not do the following.

Use motion capture in all story/main mission cutscenes as they’re the most important in the game and use in-game cutscenes for side quests and so on (as well as improve the quality of the ingame engine cutscenes)

20,1f2v7ps,Pricerocks,1724800423.0,Playing every main AC game part 4: AC3,17,7,"It has been quite a while since my last post, but at last I’ve finished the next step in my journey to play every AC game in order. Assassin’s Creed 3 is next on the list; this time, I played the Remastered version on PC. Although I had heard many praises for the Ezio trilogy and Black Flag, I really hadn’t heard anything about this game other than a couple story spoilers, so I really had no idea what I was getting into. I found it to be somewhat of a mixed bag, improving many aspects of the gameplay, falling flat in others, but never really reaching perfection in any. **SPOILER WARNING FOR AC3 BELOW!!!**

**The Gameplay**

Let me start this off by saying that within 15 minutes of starting this game it is very clear why this game deserved to be a numbered entry instead of having a subtitle like the previous games. We’ve taken a leap comparable to the amount of change between AC1 and 2. Absolutely everything feels different and mostly for the better— running animations feel more energetic, assassinations flow much easier, the small parkour additions like slides or running around cylinders feel like a natural evolution, the Animus map is easier to read and navigate, waypoints are visible in-game… you get the idea.
  

Combat in AC3 feels especially different from other previous entries in both good and bad ways. My first few fights were pretty embarrassing as I was slow to adapt to the new systems and button placements. I loved the fluidity of animations and especially the counters where Connor dispatched several enemies at once. The weapon selection was also pretty nice, and I mostly stuck to the tomahawk. I disliked how the targeting sometimes felt janky. I also didn’t care for how some enemies were immune to certain counter options and got guaranteed hits on me if I countered and then hit the wrong button in the heat of the moment. The worst offenders were the guys with knives who you couldn’t execute or disarm, only throw, but if you’re fighting more than like 2 people then you can’t follow up on the throw so you just kept tossing them around till the fight was over. The human shield mechanic rarely ever actually allowed me to grab someone, yet the enemies still missed most of their shots. I was also rarely able to pick weapons off the ground, which sucked because I got the impression you could get into a rhythm of shooting one guy and taking his gun to kill the next. Overall, I enjoyed the combat a hair less than the Ezio games, but all it really needed was some small nudges in the right direction to surpass them.

The parkour in this game was a decided improvement upon the already good systems of previous games. While the main mechanics all stayed the same, we got the additional bits I mentioned earlier, as well as the tree climbing that flowed very nicely. We lost a tad of the complexity with the absence of things like the vertical leaps while grabbing a ledge or ziplines, but it didn’t really bother me. My only complaint about the parkour is the viewpoints felt very samey, but that’s a common problem in this series anyways. However, the map design is far less interesting than previous games. I’m not sure if this is simply because I find the setting far less unique than other games, but every place in the cities felt the same as every other place to me. The wilderness was neat, but pretty empty. I used fast travel far more in this game than in others (and not once did I go in the tunnels outside of the story). I probably would have spent a lot more time in this game if I actually liked the enviornment.

Stealth is in a very weird place in this game. Sometimes it felt incredibly easy, other times it felt impossible. Soldiers wouldn’t see you in knee-tall grass right in front of them but would spot you on a roof in their peripherals from several buildings away. Whistling tended to attract several guards even if they were spread out, which kinda defeats the purpose because if I only had 1 guard to deal with I wouldn’t need to attract him anywhere. And none of the new items seemed especially helpful for stealth (or out of it), as neither the bow or rope dart got me any quiet kills. The new assassination animations were great though, much slicker than Ezio and Altair’s long stabs. We’re trying to be quick and quiet here!

Of course, I have to mention the elephant in the room of AC3’s gameplay– the introduction of naval gameplay. I went back and forth on how I felt about it. At first I didn’t like it at all, then after doing a couple missions my mind began to change and I was having a good time. Over time, that waned again and the last few naval missions felt like a drag. I think everything maybe felt a little too slow. You spend 30+ seconds just sailing forward before a mission really starts, and then forever trying to dodge shots while lining up your own cannon attacks, except the enemy shoots way faster than you do and you may have to duck several times before getting one shot off. I can feel the bones of something great in here but AC3 doesn’t deliver for me. Hopefully Black Flag pulls it off.

I don’t have as much to say about the other new/returning mechanics so I’ll give a couple sentences on each that I remember: The new Brotherhood system was pretty meh for me, I mostly forgot I even had them at my disposal, a huge downgrade from the Ezio trilogy. The crafting/trading were far too complicated for the meager rewards they offered (especially at the beginning when you don’t have any good items or recipes) so I didn’t even bother with it, and I had a fine time beating the game without any of the crafted items. Hell, I just remembered while writing this I never got the weapons you can buy after sequence 9 since I was locked in on finishing the story. I’m an animal lover so without the crafting incentive I didn’t partake in hunting, I probably killed around 10 animals in my playthrough. The side missions were also pretty repetitive/uninteresting, I liberated two districts, did some assassination contracts, and started a few others but never finished.

Finally, some minor things I liked and some nitpicks:

* The tutorials in this game lasted far too long, I understand that the game was basically remade from the ground up but you have to play over half of the AC3’s sequences before the training wheels come off.
* It was cool that the map opened up as I walked around instead of needing to sync with a viewpoint to have stuff I could see in front of me on the map, but also it felt like viewpoints barely unlocked any of the area around them.
* The outfit selection in this game is perfect. Even the outfits from other AC games went hard, but I stuck to changing the colors on Connor’s clothes.
* It took me like 30 minutes to climb one of the generic viewpoint trees, not sure why that one in particular was so bad other than the controls sucking since I knew exactly where I had to go.
* The graphics in this game were much improved from previous games but you could still tell it was a 2011 game with modern graphics put on top at times.
* It’s pretty funny that the pistols in this game are far worse than the guns and crossbows Ezio used 280 years ago but that’s understandable, as ranged weapons were getting pretty overpowered.
* Forts were neat, would have been better if the stealth was better.
* The rope dart seems kind of pointless.
* The horse whistle being a separate tool was annoying and lead to me wasting a lot of time scrolling to/from it.

But enough about that, let’s talk about…

**The story**

For this particular review I will discuss Connor’s and Desmond’s stories separately.

It’s hard to talk about the story of AC3 without mentioning how absurdly long the Haytham section of the game is. I didn’t get to play Connor till my 3rd session playing the game ~6 hours in, and you’re still doing tutorials at that point. I might have been more intrigued by Haytham’s story had I not accidentally spoiled myself on the twist by scrolling the subreddit after my last post here and immediately seeing a post with a title to the effect of “How did you react to the reveal of Haytham being a Templar???”. Instead, I just spent that whole time waiting for the game to reveal that information so I could get on to actually playing as the character on the cover art. However, it was a refreshing way to introduce the cabal of Templars we have to kill and give them each at least a little personality before we shank them. Haytham was an interesting character, he seemed a slightly less evil person than our usual Templars, but the brief romance between him and Ziio wasn’t even remotely believable and I strongly doubted he would be redeemed.

After a looong time, we finally move on to Ratonhnhaké:ton aka Connor’s story. His origins play out pretty much exactly the way one would expect, with his mother dying in an attack on his village, him meeting Charles Lee and the Templars and vowing to kill them, and him later setting out on a quest to find an Assassin to help him protect his village from another impending attack. This leads him to Achilles, a weary veteran who doesn’t want to train Connor but gets worn down by his persistence. There’s nothing really bad about this, it’s just very trope-y. Connor’s first interactions with the white man’s world establish him as naive and stubborn, and pissed at basically everyone outside of the homestead he meets with varying levels of justification. These traits never change. Charles Lee is also a massive bastard, I didn’t really know where to mention that. 

The story for a while plays out, once more, exactly as one would expect. Connor becomes Forrest Gump before the original Forrest is even born as he winds up at the Boston Massacre, Boston Tea Party, and Lexington & Concord. All the while, he does the usual sneaking and stabbing, stopping schemes and scratching names off of his list and fighting with Achilles constantly. None of this is really memorable except for the fact that at one point, Connor goes in and out of prison and the Templars blatantly pass on the easiest chance to kill him they could ever hope for. Eventually, his mission leads him to meet his father Haytham, and this is where the story really begins to shine. They bicker back and forth as they temporarily form an alliance, and gradually begin to respect one another’s skills. As time goes on, both of them desperately try to convince the other to see the conflict from their perspective, certain that they are right and the other will join them if they can just see reason. However, this falls apart when Haytham cheekily reveals that Washington was behind the attack on Connor's village and is planning another, and even through the shock of this revelation Connor can still plainly see that Haytham is just trying to manipulate him to his own ends, cutting ties with both of them. I seriously respect the way this game portrays Washington and the other revolutionary figures, honestly admitting that while they fought for the noble cause of the colonies’ freedom from Britain’s control, they were far from perfect, especially in their treatment of the indigenous people. I dread to think of how controversial this aspect of the story would be if the game came out today.

The third act of the game is sadly marred by some weird decision making and characters suddenly being far better or worse of a combatant than they should be. Connor returns to his village to save his people but is instead confronted by his best friend Kanen'tó:kon who has been seduced by Charles Lee. In the span of 45 seconds, Connor, an Assassin who has been trained for years by Achilles, is brought onto the brink of a fatal blow from Kanen'tó:kon, who has remained in the village that Connor left with the express purpose of training to protect his people because he couldn’t acquire the skills and resources he needed to do so in the village. Seriously, watch this cutscene on YouTube right now and take in how absurd it is for Connor to be put into this situation. Worse yet, Connor kills his best friend almost instantly, making his following angst a lot harder to take seriously. 

Then, Achilles dies. I don’t think we even knew he was especially sick before that cutscene, he just suddenly dies.

The next little while is spent on securing the loyalty of some ships to attack Fort George as a distraction for Connor to get inside and kill Charles Lee. Within 10 seconds of the attack beginning, Connor gets incapacitated by his own ships and stumbles through the fort. Within another 10 seconds of Connor saying that he needs to stay away from the guards, he ends up in a fight with Haytham that he handles with considerable ease. It doesn’t seem like there’s any realistically way Connor in a healthy condition could take Haytham in a fight but it’s actually really easy if you throw Haytham into a few objects around the area. Still, Haytham does manage to take the upper hand, and instead of just killing Connor with the literal blades on his wrists, decides to slowly choke him while monologuing about how the Templars will never lose, and **then** leaves both of Connor’s arms free, and **THEN** allows Connor to move his hand all the way to Haytham’s throat to cut it with his hidden blade. 

Shortly after, Connor (with a much cooler haircut) surrenders to Charles Lee at Haytham’s funeral. Instead of killing Connor on the spot, a mistake Charles Lee has already made multiple times, he monologues to Connor about how he’s going to ruin his life and then has a couple mooks take him around the corner so they can promptly be killed. One of the mooks tells us Charles is headed to the harbor to catch a ferry, so naturally Connor then decides to swim 200m out to board a random ship to find out where Charles is headed, then goes to the harbor to stop Charles from catching a ferry. There is a ship on fire for some reason when we get there, and after a low-energy chase through it we suddenly get one of the best exchanges in the whole of the series:

> “Why do you persist...? You put us down. We rise again. You end one plot – we forge another. You try so hard... But it always ends the same. Those who know you think you mad and this is why... Even those men you sought to save have turned their backs on you. Yet you fight. You resist. Why?”

> ""Because no one else will.""

Charles manages to slither away from even this encounter, but fortunately there is a random guy at the harbor who is perfectly willing to tell you where he went and even take you there. Finally, the two men meet in a bar and share a drink, and then Connor stabs Charles Lee to death. None of this bothers the bartender or the other patrons. Finally, Connor returns to the homestead, taking down the hatchet that signified his war against the Templars and hiding the amulet in a grave that holds a great surprise– Achilles chose the name Connor after his son who died. That got me emotional and I didn’t even really care about them.
But enough about that, let’s talk about Desmond!

I have complained in my last few reviews that the modern story has basically been shafted in favor of the past, and I think even Ubisoft finally agreed. Between the lore drops as you parkour through the mysterious cave and the missions you go on to find batteries, it finally feels like we’re actually getting something. In terms of characterization there’s not really anything to talk about– William Miles is finally given a proper introduction here but he doesn't really have anything interesting going on, and Sebastian and Rebecca are exactly the same as they were when we met them. I liked the introduction of Daniel Cross as a foil to Desmond, but he was entirely wasted as a character.

I don’t have a lot to say about the first two missions. I do really appreciate that Desmond’s sections have virtually no HUD to immersively indicate we’re not in the Animus and honestly wouldn’t mind more sections where I have to play with no HUD with a greater level of challenge. The locale of a Brazilian martial arts match is a memorably unique choice. However, the third mission suffers just as much as the third act of Connor’s story does. 

Firstly, William gets captured after he volunteers to go on a mission off-screen, which is the most predictable plot development of the whole game. Then, Miles goes straight to the Abstergo facility and murders the hell out of the shockingly underprepared guards. He gets corner by Cross who gets Deus-ex-machina’d by what seems like the bleeding effect, or some other kind of First Civ shenanigans and then is promptly killed before that can be elaborated on. Even more shockingly, Vidic then lets Desmond come straight up to him and tells Desmond to give him the apple. Reader, if your mortal enemy has an ancient artifact that can mind control people nearby when held, maybe you should not let him and the artifact near you, and if he does get near you, you definitely should not goad him into pulling it out and then activating it before anyone can react. With that out of the way, every single villain in the modern story is dead and now we can go open that vault.

Reader, I mentioned at the beginning of this mountain of text that I had multiple things spoiled for me. The other thing that I had spoiled was that Desmond dies. I did appreciate the glimpse of the future if he chose to live and the parallels both to the world of AC and the real world. What really surprised me, and maybe it shouldn’t have, was how quickly and unceremoniously the game ended after Desmond made his choice. He drops to the ground and the credits roll about 15 seconds later. I guess I should’ve seen this coming as the other games also end with virtually no denouement, but I was hoping maybe the death of the main character of the franchise would have some more emotional kick to it. RIP Desmond, you had the personality of cardboard with a smiley face drawn on it but you were still more likable than Connor.

Brief story nitpicks:

* It’s kinda crazy that we didn’t get any Achilles backstory considering the implication that the Order fell on his watch.
* The eagle sequence was pretty neat, I think I’ve heard you get to actually control an eagle later in the games.
* The only thing dumber than Ben Franklin having that insanely long speech about sleeping with older women is the fact that he repeats it every time you try to talk to him. 
* The buildup to the execution scene where you can see the Assassins working in the background was really cool.

**Conclusions and Rankings**

Firstly, if you read all that you’re a beast. I don’t know why this particular review is so long other than me having a lot to talk about. But all in all, AC3 succeeds in moving the franchise forward but fails to reach the same level of quality as its past. My rankings of the game thus far are:

Disclaimer: I do NOT play a lot of indie games, and I gather, some of these were given away as freebies via PS Plus. I literally know nothing on about 90 percent of the games in the sale, and I didn't want to put any game in the recommendations I couldn't vouch for. 

For those that can recommend a game or two, I'll add it to the list. :)

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* V Rising (-25%, $29.99) - Action-RPG where you play as a vampire. It's harder than it looks, and Stunlock is gearing up for something big after its 1.0 patch.

* Dead by Daylight (-50%, $14.99) - Still heavily supported up to this day, and has a native PS5 version as well. There's a Castlevania crossover incoming soon, and Five Nights at Freddy's crossover also announced for 2025. If you're tired of multiplayer shooters, then this might be your palette cleanser.

* Cuphead (-30%, $13.99) - Cute animations but quite hard. It has a simple premise, and if you're a fan of memorizing boss patterns then this should be a cakewalk for you (heh. Plus points since you can play this co-op, though prepare for the blame game when you do.

* Stardew Valley (-20%, $11.99) - Still being supported, and if you dig life sims then you're probably going to love this. My daughter still plays this a lot.

* Pacific Drive (-30%, $20.99) -  Still getting support, and might be one of the most unique games around. This is a survival game played in a first-person perspective and you're in a friggin' station wagon. Not an easy game, mind.

* Overcooked 2 (-75%, $6.24) - If you're not familiar with the franchise, it's like Diner Dash but a lot more complex. Simple but addictive gameplay, and you can play this with multiple people though that makes it harder for some reason. Prepare for relationships to get strained since name-calling and blaming is part of the game.

* Cult of the Lamb: Cultist Edition (-50%, $14.99) - Definitely worth it, and just got a big free update as well. This one has been on sale multiple times, and is just a ton of fun. Build your cult, slay monsters, rinse and repeat. It's deeper than it looks.

* Outlast Trinity (-90%, $5.89) - Includes Outlast, Whistleblower, and Outlast 2. Excellent horror games (not survival horror but more like Isolation). You can't really fight back in these, though the tension and atmosphere are what brings it over the edge.

* Hell Let Loose (-40%, $35.99) - Still a bit too high in price for me, but this is still heavily supported up to this day with free and paid content drops. Era FPS in case you want something not Call of Duty or Battlefield.

* Dredge (-40%, $14.99) - Just got a huge DLC this month, and this is an RPG fishing game with Loecraftian horror elements. It's not for everyone, but might be worth a shot at that price.

* Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn (-30%, $27.99) - Recently released, this is an action-RPG who must fight against the gods. Nope. nowhere near God of War's level of quality and depth. Janky, but if you're looking for a AA game to finish for the year, then this could be it. Check YT for gameplay to see if you'll dig it.

* Inside (-75%, $4.99) - Amazing platforming game that has unique puzzles. One of Playdead's masterpieces. Loved this a lot, and at that price, definitely worth it.

* Fricitonal Collection (-35%, $59.75) - Includes Amnesia: The Bunker, Amnesia: Rebirth, Amnesia: Collection and SOMA. Definitely worth it if you dig Frictional's style of horror.

* SOMA (-80%, $5.99) - Amnesia but in sci-fi. First-person horror, lots of exploration and puzzle solving. I'd say a bit more action-y than Amnesia, but not everyone might like that.

* The Talos Principle Collection (-50%, $24.99) - Not played this, but a friend swears by the two games. Expect puzzle solving in first-person.

* Quantum Error (-50%, $14.99) - Survival horror in space or cosmic horror. Definitely not as good as the Resident Evil games, has a good load of bugs (not sure if the devs patched them all out). Probably still not worth it at that price? But if you want a new horror game to play with friends to joke around with, then perhaps give this a go? Just don't expect this to finish it since the game isn't that good.

* Trek to Yomi (-70%, $5.99) - Side scrolling samurai game that has an interesting art style. Developed by Flying Wild Hog who made the Shadow Warrior games.

* Valiant Hearts: The Collection (-50%, $12.49) -  The Great War is on sale for just $3.74. This bundle includes The Great War and Coming Home. Have not played Coming Home, but the original base game has a great story, charming art style. Just don't expect a deep gameplay experience, but it should cover your gaming weekend if you wan t something new.

* Child of Light (-70%, $4.49) - Platforming RPG by Ubisoft. Exquisite art, and gameplay not shabby either. I think I remember playing this on the Vita, but worth a look erven if it's old.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1exquve/psn_store_playstation_indies_sale_now_live_over/

If it’s gonna be a triple A blockbuster game, it’d probably be managed best by high quality companies.

These studios take immediate action against cheaters and are incredibly thoughtful and deliberate about their artwork/content. They’re really amazing studios, and while maybe rockstar hasn’t done many team multiplayer shooters, a refined game like rainbow six could be a great first venture for them into a new market. 

Like it’s clear to us at this point that Ubisoft is one of if not the worst game developer ever. 

Imagine if siege were owned by a development giant that actually considered their design. I know this is far fetched but really: think about how much better this game could be than it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1emrxd2/if_ubisoft_werent_the_company_in_charge_of_siege/

Sure, you can say it's not the final version but this exact thing has been happening since AC Origins so you can definitely expect what you this issue present in Shadows. The game plainly lacks ambient sounds and with the ambient music not being constant like in the past, and no large cities to simulate city ambient, the game world appears dead.

Examples of the issue:

\[AC Odyssey world and ambient by LazerzZ, from 23:15 onwards\] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCuXlPC6gsQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCuXlPC6gsQ)

\[AC Odyssey sound technical analysis by FILIP OSCAR\] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7W5KGLrIU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7W5KGLrIU)

This is Ubisoft's biggest IP, they put effort into sound but due to some weird possible limitation they have, they clearly don't think it's worth the effort to fully fix this issue. They've had seven years and four games to fix it. This is not acceptable in 2024 when smaller games produced has better audio design, and even older AC, when compared sounds massively better. 

So please if any AC dev team is reading this, we request you to take this issue and improve however you possibly can. We want a better immersive decent quality audio, good ambient sounds. 

If you can't fix this. Just for the love of immersion add an option to have constant ambient background music like in AC1, AC2, ACB, ACR, AC4. And no, the option present in audio setting frequency since Origins does NOT work.

## Season 2.0

Seasons were introduced to The Division 2 in March 2020 with the release of Warlords of New York. They have become a key aspect of the endgame, however, after four years, this model has reached its limit. To prepare for the game's future, they needed to reevaluate the season model, update it, and equip the game with the right tools to make each season truly unique. 

TU 22 & Seasons 2.0 offers an exciting mix of new gameplay elements, new story, and rewards, all presented in a fresh way that allows for greater creativity and surprise. The main idea behind Seasons 2.0 is to break away from the current seasonal model by transforming the entire experience. 

&nbsp;

### Seasonal Journey Missions

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season’s content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

### Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

&nbsp;

### Manhunt Scouts

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

&nbsp;

### Seasonal Modifiers

=> [Season Modifiers]( https://i.imgur.com/XfduRhn.png)

The Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience.

The modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges.

&nbsp;

###Season Pass 

The optional Season Pass is available for all The Division 2 players starting at Level 1, priced at 1000 Premium Credits ($9.99 or your regional equivalent) in the in-game store and does not require ownership of the Warlords of New York DLC. While accessible from Level 1, please note that the rewards remain locked until Level 40.

Additionally, players can opt for the Premium+ option, available for 3000 Premium Credits ($29.99 or your regional equivalent), which bundles the Premium Season Pass with multiple rewards, offering even greater value.

&nbsp;

=> [SeasonPass]( https://i.imgur.com/BurFjAY.png)

&nbsp;

Players with the Season Pass can gain access to the following premium track rewards: 

*   10 gear dyes
*   10 weapon skins 
*   2 outfits 
*   2 new Prestige Arm Patches

&nbsp;

Moreover, players can earn 400 Virtual Currency by progressing through the Season Pass on the premium track.

But that's not all! Free players now can receive cosmetics in the Season Pass. The free track includes 1 outfit and 1 weapon skin, allowing every Agent to gear up and stand out in the streets of D.C.

##New Gear

This season introduces two new Named Weapons and several new Talents, along with a new Gear Set and Brand Set. Exotic collectors can look forward to a new Exotic Assault Rifle, an Exotic Holster, and an exclusive Exotic Chest Piece awarded for completing the Climax Mission. 

###Gear Brand Set - Legatus S.p.A.

##Balancing Pass

###Rework

**Sledgehammer** - Weapon Talent

Dealing damage with a grenade applies a mark on target. Targets with marks will take **15%(20%) more damage to armor** and have a -20% movement speed. Mark disappears after 10 seconds.  
  
_Previously: Dealing damage with a grenade applies a mark on target. Targets with marks will take 30% more damage to armor and have a -20% movement speed. Mark disappears after 10 seconds._

&nbsp;  

**Mosquito Song** - Exotic Pistol

Hitting an enemy applies a stack. Stacks are shared between players. At **5** stacks, the enemy will forcefully target the last player to apply a stack for 5s **and take 25% more damage to armor**. Stacks deplete every 5s. Activating the effect on an enemy will remove all stacks from other enemies.

&nbsp;  

###Rifles and MMR's become fully automatic

With TU22 these Rifles and Marksman Rifles are now fully automatic:

&nbsp;  

**Rifles:**

*   ACR
*   UIC15
*   The Ravenous
*   M1A
*   Lightweight M4
*   LVOA-C
*   MDR
*   Resolute Mk47
*   Mk17
*   SIG 716
*   USC

&nbsp;

**MMR’s:**

*   G28
*   Mk20
*   SVD

&nbsp;

### Balancing - Weapons & Talents, Gear & Brand Sets, Exotic Weapons & Gear

With the introduction of Seasons 2.0, which brings new features like Modifiers, Scouts, Priority Objectives and the Seasonal Journey, we’ve taken a fresh approach to balancing, aiming to give different playstyles more distinct personalities.

This update will address a wide range of elements, including various weapon categories, Exotic weapons and gear, weapon mods, talents, and gear sets.

&nbsp;

### Loot Pool Update

In TU22, a fresh batch of Named Weapons will be added to the loot pool for missions and mission bosses. While the original loot tables remain unchanged, they now offer additional opportunities to obtain these new items.

Although these weapons have a higher drop rate, they are not guaranteed rewards and may require multiple attempts to acquire. The likelihood of these weapons dropping increases with the difficulty level of the mission.

These new loot drop chances are exclusively available for characters at level 40 or above and are limited to regular versions of missions - they do not apply to ""invaded"" missions.

#Shades of Red

Year 6 Season 2: Shades of Red is marking the start of a new seasonal journey. With Aaron Keener in custody at the White House, he aims to strike a deal with The Division. Before Agents can learn what he knows, they have to secure the other members of Keener's team, starting with Theo Parnell.

&nbsp;

***
##SEASONS 2.0

###Seasonal Journey

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season's content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

###Seasonal Modifiers

=> [Season Modifiers]( https://i.imgur.com/XfduRhn.png)

The Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience: 

*   **Global Modifiers** set the overall theme of the season and are active at all times while the system is enabled, affecting the core gameplay loop. 
    *   This season, the theme is ""range."" The Global Modifier, ""Point Blank,"" grants a bonus damage based on distance from enemies. 
*   **Active Modifiers** function like ""ultimate"" abilities, giving your character a short burst of power. 
    *   Players can choose from a selection of Active Modifiers, but only one can be equipped at a time. This season, they manipulate the range zones set by the Global Modifier. 
*   **Passive Modifiers** work in conjunction with the Global Modifier, adding extra bonuses. 
    *   Players can equip up to three Passive Modifiers simultaneously. In the first season, these modifiers provide additional benefits based on the range zones from the Global Modifier. 
*   **Hostile Modifiers:** These represent how the enemies adapt to your new abilities. 
    *   As players progress through the season, enemies will gradually gain new abilities linked to specific enemy types, forcing you to use the Global, Passive, and Active Modifiers strategically to counter them. 

The modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges. 

&nbsp;

###Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

Players can choose from three objectives, selecting one based on limited information such as duration, reward category, and mission type. Once a selection is made, it is locked in, and the full details of the objective and its rewards will be revealed.

If none of the objectives appeal to the player, the system allows for rerolls and has an Abandon Objective feature. Players can earn reroll points by completing Priority Objectives, with a maximum of three rerolls stored at any time.

There is no limit to the number of Priority Objectives a player can complete, and rewards include XP, Season Pass XP, items, resources, and passive modifier unlocks.  

&nbsp;

###Manhunt Scouts

=> [Parnell Manhunt](https://i.imgur.com/khEGjlR.jpeg)

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

Each week, players can tackle a Scout, which consists of three different activities. These activities will vary, and players must solve a small riddle to complete each one. Activities should be completed in order, and once all three are finished, players will receive the Scout Reward.

Once all activities in a Scout are completed, players will receive a bigger reward, including a unique collectible. However, new Scouts cannot be accessed until the current one is completed.

By the end of the season, completing all Scouts unlocks the Manhunt Climax Mission, and finishing that unlocks the Master Climax Mission, so make sure to stay on track each week.

&nbsp;

##GEAR, WEAPONS & TALENTS

I used to get an AMD Driver timeout error when the crash happened, however now the game closes without any given reason. 

Its really frustrating, as I tend to get really immersed in the game, and the crash ruins everything. 

I've tried multiple things like a clean install, verifying files, updated graphics drivers, run Ubisoft and the game as administrator, disabled cloud save in Ubisoft Connect and played around with the game settings yet nothing seems to work. 

Does the game run like this for anyone else using AMD? Anyone managed to fix this for themselves? 

Any help is appreciated.

##Revisit Seasonal Modifiers

The goal is that each season is unique, and replaying an entire season with a modifier that you already know is also not something they think is fun for players that participate in every season. But what could happen is, that they bring a modifier back for a time-limited event – similar to the Throwback Event that we just had.

##Master Difficulty

Will only be applied to the Climax Mission of the Manhunt and not any other mission. 

It is a handcrafted experience that is intended to be hard in the area between legendary and incursion difficulty.

As of October 31st, there is a new Friend Referral Program active. The old Stinger Hunter Outfit is still there for new players, but there is now also a second outfit. When you invite a player into the game, you get a new “Insurgent” outfit and backpack as reward. 

The main goal is that you do it again and not just once. You can also invite players back that have stopped playing. So, for example, when you bring back a player that had their last play session before June 2024, you can also get the reward.

The goal is to update the Friend Referral Program as we go through the seasons.

To celebrate Halloween, there will be a “Laughing Gas” Bundle giveaway on the official The Division channels (Discord / Twitter) and participating creators. 

It will also be available in the store. 

&nbsp;

## Special Events

During the season they are also planning further special events. As of now we don’t have specific dates: 

* Winter Event
* More XP Events

More details to follow.

&nbsp;

## Q&A

**Will there be an Apparel Event this Season**

At the moment they are not planning an Apparel Event this Season. The idea is to reward apparel items through other ways – like special events – and not just the grind of an Apparel Event. 

&nbsp;

**Are seasonal characters still a thing**

You can play the Seasonal Journey with a level 1 character, but it is not required. So, you can play with your level 40 character. 

&nbsp;

**More Legendary Missions**

Not planned at the moment, since they were intended for Strongholds only, but maybe down the road. 

&nbsp;

**Extra character slot*

No, that is no longer planned. 

&nbsp;

**Brooklyn DLC Information**

Will be revealed when it is ready. 

&nbsp;

**New Raids / Incursions**

Not planned at this point – but maybe down the road. 

&nbsp;

**New Conflict Map**

Not planned at this point. 

&nbsp;

**Is Faye Lau still alive**

NO

&nbsp;

**Crossplay?**

Not on the table at the moment. 

&nbsp;

**Global Events in Division 1**

They are a small team and they have prioritized Division 2. While some people have been working on it to bring the Global Event back, it is very difficult to make any changes to Division 1 at this point. 

&nbsp;

**Raid Exclusives on Master Difficulty**

Raid exclusive Exotics remain raid exclusive. 

&nbsp;

**Blueprints from old seasons**

The goal is to make them available. 

&nbsp;

**Revisit Descent**

At this point they know what is working with the game mode and what does not, and while they want to revisit Descent, it is not planned in the near future. 

&nbsp;

**Multiple Exotics**

Exotics are balanced so that you can equip only one at a time. When you want to equip multiple Exotics, they have to be nerfed, because you would give you too much power. 

&nbsp;

**Descent Audio Logs**

There will be new collectibles with this season and they are looking into ways to make the old ones accessible. 

&nbsp;

**Monetize backpack trophies and arm patches**

There are no plans to add those to the store, since they were part of those seasons. 

&nbsp;

**Collaborations with other Ubisoft Titles**

They are also in discussions with other Ubisoft titles – not just external partners - what they could do that fit the Division. But no announcement at this point. 

&nbsp;

**New Faction in the game**

A new faction is a lot of work, because it also requires new behavior, new looks and new challenges and that is not in scope at this point. 

&nbsp;

**More Clan Members**

Nothing is planned at this point, but they want to revisit clans. 

&nbsp;

**Gear Mods rework**

They know it is not a good experience.

39,1gbawr4,AgentAzael,1729797608.0,Seasonal caches not dropping exotics?,4,20,"My friend and I have been milking the Throwback Event's global events, spending all our stars on seasonal caches trying to obtain specific exotics, yet we have opened over 60 seasonal caches so far and neither of us have had a single exotic drop yet.

According to [Ubisoft's press release](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/28OmSUyy9oVttICJ45zxye/y6s2-throwback-event) (and an identical [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1fyj8wa/the_division_2_y6s2_throwback_event/) on Reddit), there should be a flat 10% chance for specific seasonal caches to drop a corresponding exotic. But we have been purchasing these caches with our event currency and not a single exotic has come out of those caches for either of us.

Yes, we are purchasing the correct caches. The ones named ""Year 2 Season 1 Cache"" and similar. The ones listed in the chart in those links above. I specifically am trying to obtain the Collector exotic chest and thus have been purchasing the ""Year 5 Season 2 Cache"" repeatedly. I have opened exactly 32 of them and not a single exotic has dropped. Only Lengmo and Ortiz Exuro gear has ever come out of that cache. My friend has spent about 15 stars on the same cache, and another 15 or so on another season cache; not a single exotic has dropped for him either.

Yeah, I know, *RNG*. But odds are odds. With a supposed 10% chance per cache, the odds of opening 60 caches and receiving zero exotics calculates out to 0.52% (1 in 192). The fact that we have zero is either a bug or ***extremely*** poor luck.

We're playing on PC, though that shouldn't matter.

Have any of you been receiving exotics from seasonal caches? If you have, does it feel like it's actually happening at a roughly 10% rate? Has anyone received an exotic specifically from the Year 5 Season 2 Cache?",https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1gbawr4/seasonal_caches_not_dropping_exotics/

42,1gavvqk,SenVetis,1729749869.0,This community is Evil. BP Trial/Rant?,1,10,"This past Season. I bought my first ever shop purchase, the Battlepass. For what it's worth, this is how well it's gone since it began.
Let's just say, It's unpredictable, yet still Chaotic as usual.

• How many times will I see & hear constant racism?

• Why does everyone expect you do get 10+ Kills minimum to speak, when they beg for Callouts?

• Why do people rally against 1 player, Berate the life out of them, because they had a bad game?

• Why do people act like Elitists, screeching about the wrong things, while blaming whoever they place their anger on?

• Why must people Team kill a Player who has the Battlepass? Geeze, Go back to banning them then. I'd rather be alive and Play.

• Why can't Seige players behave?

• Why are Seige players the only breed of Human, to ever be Offensive for fun?

• Is everyone abusing Shields and Exploits now?

• Why is 80% of the playerbase, Crazy? Not ""Haha"" crazy, but actually lost their minds? I haven't seen a lobby, not talk about Sex or Drugs in weeks.

• Appearantly, not having a Mic is Greifing, So I got reported for it on one match by 3 people.

• I also got reported, for someone else having a 4 squad. So yes, I was reported for being solo.

• I got reported Thrice by a 2 man squad, for being ""Handicapped"" then ""Black"" soon after ""American""

• Fourth match I got reported for not getting any kills. Yet I was the only player reinforcing, Droning, Pinging, destroying gadgets, etc. As my teammates refused any of the work, + constantly rushed + Called me ""Psycho"" for wanting less angles.

• Why is this game, innately stressful?

• Turned on Voice chat for the first time in 9 years. a friend said they'd pay me $5if i did. Will genuinely wait another 15 years before turning it on again. Yikes.

• am I just the Unluckiest Seige player ever?

• I hope the Doktor's curse gets cured. Man is that mode frustrating. Fun, but damn.

• I hope trapping a person under a desk is bannable In Doktor's curse.

• what the hell is a ""Gyatt"" ? And why the hell am I going to get smoked by one, because I went Amaru?

• who the hell is Carlos??? A new meme?

• Does nobody know how to use Ying? I swear, Imma go blind IRL with how many times my teammates hit me with a Candela.

• Teamwork and Cordination don't exist.

• After about a few days of the update going live, I finally got some good matches in. Only to be met with -134RP, as my teammates were cheating. Can I never win, even when I do win?

• My reputation went from Esteemed to Disruptive, this Season. I've never once had it drop this low. Great. I haven't changed anything.

• Will I forever be stuck in Copper? I barely have enough time to play as it is. It's hard out here for a Solo only player, but man these people make it so much harder.

• I was told to basically Harm myself, because I Got spawn peeked twice from different locations, as the enemy was not pinged outside.

• I've had about 2 Decent matches thus far. No drama, actual people with self respect, and could play to play. Not treat it like a Job, or Asset to show off.

[Final words]
Honestly. Even the Battlepass isn't worth the money, let alone any serious investment into this game anymore. Memberships are a Complete Scam to profit on what is left of the game's popularity, to help Ubisoft's bottom line float before they hit bankruptcy. 
I rarely ever buy extra content at all, unless it holds it's worth. There is very little to praise here. The only noteworthy thing, is me finally being able to unlock the last operator. I could've grinded months for, without spending $10.
I don't think I'll be buying the battlepass again.
Why buy it, when other games give back enough premium currency to continue the Battlepass for the Next season? 600 Credits back, is an Insult.

This action stems from their frustration over Ubisoft’s new return-to-office policy, which mandates employees to be in the office at least three days a week. The French video game workers' union, Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV), is calling on Ubisoft's French employees to join the strike from October 15 to October 17, 2024.

The strike reflects growing discontent among employees, particularly following Ubisoft’s announcement of a hybrid work model that workers feel imposes unnecessary hardship. This tension comes in the midst of other challenges Ubisoft faces, including poor game performance and management decisions that have already upset employees and parts of the player base.

This protest could be a turning point for Ubisoft as it tries to navigate internal dissatisfaction while tackling broader industry pressures.

#Shades of Red

Year 6 Season 2: Shades of Red is marking the start of a new seasonal journey. With Aaron Keener in custody at the White House, he aims to strike a deal with The Division. Before Agents can learn what he knows, they have to secure the other members of Keener's team, starting with Theo Parnell.

&nbsp;

***
##SEASONS 2.0

###Seasonal Journey

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season's content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

###Seasonal Modifiers

=> [Season Modifiers]( https://i.imgur.com/XfduRhn.png)

The Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience: 

*   **Global Modifiers** set the overall theme of the season and are active at all times while the system is enabled, affecting the core gameplay loop. 
    *   This season, the theme is ""range."" The Global Modifier, ""Point Blank,"" grants a bonus damage based on distance from enemies. 
*   **Active Modifiers** function like ""ultimate"" abilities, giving your character a short burst of power. 
    *   Players can choose from a selection of Active Modifiers, but only one can be equipped at a time. This season, they manipulate the range zones set by the Global Modifier. 
*   **Passive Modifiers** work in conjunction with the Global Modifier, adding extra bonuses. 
    *   Players can equip up to three Passive Modifiers simultaneously. In the first season, these modifiers provide additional benefits based on the range zones from the Global Modifier. 
*   **Hostile Modifiers:** These represent how the enemies adapt to your new abilities. 
    *   As players progress through the season, enemies will gradually gain new abilities linked to specific enemy types, forcing you to use the Global, Passive, and Active Modifiers strategically to counter them. 

The modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges. 

&nbsp;

###Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

Players can choose from three objectives, selecting one based on limited information such as duration, reward category, and mission type. Once a selection is made, it is locked in, and the full details of the objective and its rewards will be revealed.

If none of the objectives appeal to the player, the system allows for rerolls and has an Abandon Objective feature. Players can earn reroll points by completing Priority Objectives, with a maximum of three rerolls stored at any time.

There is no limit to the number of Priority Objectives a player can complete, and rewards include XP, Season Pass XP, items, resources, and passive modifier unlocks.  

&nbsp;

###Manhunt Scouts

=> [Parnell Manhunt](https://i.imgur.com/khEGjlR.jpeg)

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

Each week, players can tackle a Scout, which consists of three different activities. These activities will vary, and players must solve a small riddle to complete each one. Activities should be completed in order, and once all three are finished, players will receive the Scout Reward.

Once all activities in a Scout are completed, players will receive a bigger reward, including a unique collectible. However, new Scouts cannot be accessed until the current one is completed.

By the end of the season, completing all Scouts unlocks the Manhunt Climax Mission, and finishing that unlocks the Master Climax Mission, so make sure to stay on track each week.

&nbsp;

##GEAR, WEAPONS & TALENTS

##UPDATED LOOT POOL

### Named Weapons

In TU22, a fresh batch of Named Weapons will be added to the loot pool for missions and mission bosses. While the original loot tables remain unchanged, they now offer additional opportunities to obtain these new items.

Although these weapons have a higher drop rate, they are not guaranteed rewards and may require multiple attempts to acquire. The likelihood of these weapons dropping increases with the difficulty level of the mission.

These new loot drop chances are exclusively available for characters at level 40 or above and are limited to regular versions of missions - they do not apply to ""invaded"" missions.

50,1gbwkdy,slashplaid,1729869094.0,Major confusion about Steam version of Double Agent,11,15,"Been trying to play the OG Xbox version of DA recently. Tried via xemu, it worked okay, but some weird graphical issues turned me off. Figured I'd try Steam and, lo and behold, it appears the version on Steam IS the OG Xbox/Ubisoft Montreal version of the game, at least as far as all the images on the store page indicate.

https://preview.redd.it/2hl1t6ow3xwd1.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ad15090f8c466e6b158065be051296130b706c7

However, as I was looking into some configuration changes/fixes to get better PC performance, every post I see seems to be saying that the PC version of the game is the Ubisoft Shanghai/X360 version of DA. Color me confused. The store page appears to be the OG Xbox version, right? Is it possible to play this version on PC? Or is emulation the only route?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Splintercell/comments/1gbwkdy/major_confusion_about_steam_version_of_double/
51,1g3dwx5,l0vefrombehind,1728906939.0,Second strike at Ubisoft is approaching,239,200,"As of today, October 14, 2024, Ubisoft workers in France are preparing for a significant strike. This action stems from their frustration over Ubisoft’s new return-to-office policy, which mandates employees to be in the office at least three days a week. The French video game workers' union, Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV), is calling on Ubisoft's French employees to join the strike from October 15 to October 17, 2024.

The strike reflects growing discontent among employees, particularly following Ubisoft’s announcement of a hybrid work model that workers feel imposes unnecessary hardship. This tension comes in the midst of other challenges Ubisoft faces, including poor game performance and management decisions that have already upset employees and parts of the player base.

This protest could be a turning point for Ubisoft as it tries to navigate internal dissatisfaction while tackling broader industry pressures.

52,1g0p9qf,DomFakker37,1728584032.0,I actually love AC: Unity! Sorry (or not?) for being 10 years late.,102,59,"From what I've read, Unity has one of the worst reputations of all the AC games, but if I understand it correctly, the reason for this comes mostly out of the technical issues the game had when it launched back in 2014. I guess I'm glad I did not know anything about the game back then, thus my experience was not ruined.

I just started it recently and the game is amazing! Sure, it gets a little time to get used to, but the visuals are astonishing, the cutscenes are not boring, the story is (despite some small flaws) really good and the missions are rich!

**Visuals:**

The details in faces are almost unbelievable, considering the game came out in 2014. I probably can't name any game that looked that good back in that time except The Witcher or GTA V, which really surprised me. Not only that, the streets of Paris look really good, whether it's the dirty outskirts or the noble houses of the rich people. This is also the first AC game where there is that many pedestrians just randomly doing their stuff and blocking your way. I suppose this is a performance issue, and since this was the first AC released for PS4 (correct me if I'm wrong), I understand that the devs were able to go a step further this time.

**Missions:**

The quests aren't repetitive at all, there was not a single time when I would feel bored. The main story missions are innovative, the side quests are not long, they're simple (that goes to basically every side mission, such as helping your assassin fellows or helping your Social houses etc). I also adore the way the game handles assassinations, it basically gives you multiple options how to enter, how to kill and how to deal with situations. I love that you can simply run at your target and stab them, but you can think your approach through and choose your way of distracting the guards and getting in. There is also not that many tailing missions, which AC series is (mostly negatively) famous for, which I really appreciate.

**Collectibles:**

Another typical AC mechanic (not only, I guess). I remember being tired to death when collecting feathers in Ezio's trilogy. I also hated collecting anything in Connor's game. But Unity? Nothing feels forced. There are chests that have some kind of interaction to it, which is fun. There are cockades that are your typical AC collectible, you usually have to free-run or climb to get them, nothing excessively boring though. And there are side-missions that, as I menitoned, are not long enough to be boring, even though they're sometimes vague thanks to that, so completing them feels good, unlike some previous AC titles.

**Controls:**

They feel clunky when one starts with Unity right after finishing Black Flag and Rogue, and they get some time getting used to, but once you do, the controlled descent is an amazing thing and so is the intentional climbing. I still sometimes jump up instead of jumping down just cause it's not intuitive for me, but I guess I'll learn that. The combat system is not bad at all, even though it's tough for a beginner, who is used to clear fights without even upgrading his weapons, to die after two hits. Not being able to use enemies as Human Shiled and not being able to Whistle is surprising and not a welcome choice, but again, it's not that hard to get used to the new system.

**Coop:**

This is the only thing that I have a problem with, since it seems that [since 30th September, noone has achieved a PS trophy that is strictly linked to coop play](https://psnprofiles.com/trophy/3072-assassins-creed-unity/46-never-say-die). That, sadly, applies to me as well, since I'm unable to connect to anyone, I just get the ""Connection Failed 0x70000006 Error"". And I'm not the only one, many people playing on consoles seem to have the same issue. It seems like the servers are down, even though on Ubisoft's page it says that they're not. I tried going through their PS5 troubleshooting guide and I tried following some random advice from people with similar issue but nothing worked for me. It's a shame, since this is the only thing that prevents me from getting the platinum trophy, but most importantly, I can't enjoy the coop gameplay that I was really looking forward to, especially since I was hoping for something better than that poorly executed multiplayer from Black Flag. I contacted the Ubisoft Support, currently waiting for their reponse, but in case anyone too has this issue, please, let me know.

  
So that's it, that's my post, AC: Unity is awesome and I really hope I'll be able to enjoy 100% of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1g0p9qf/i_actually_love_ac_unity_sorry_or_not_for_being/

Note: No FromSoftware Games discounted, no Stellar Blade. Not a lot of horror games but that should change soon. Halloween PSN sale should launch Oct. 23.

**PSN Deal of the Week:** [**Lies of P (-40$, $41.99)**](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/eff78812-7d8a-4871-935d-71626db857fe/1)

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

* **NBA 2K25 (-30%, $48.99)** – Literally the only basketball game in town. If you like basketball, the NBA, you pretty much only have this as your lone choice. Not a bad entry, but be prepared for gargantuan patches.
* **Madden NFL 25 (-35%, $45.49)** – Same as with the NBA 2K series, this is the only NFL game on consoles.
* **EA Sports MVP Bundle: Madden NFL 25 + College Football 25 (-25%, $112.49)** – Don’t play football games, but based on reviews, College Football is the superior title. If you’re planning on picking both up, this is the first time it’s on sale.
* **Destiny 2: The Final Shape (-40%, $29.99)** – Doesn’t go on sale often. The latest expansion for Destiny 2.
* **GTA 5 (-50%, $19.99)** – PS4 version is $5 less. This is the lowest it’ll go, so if you’re one of the handful that still doesn’t own this, here’s your chance to line Rockstar’s coffers.
* **Hogwarts Legacy (-70%, $20.99)** – PS4 version is a few bucks less, but this is the version to get. At that price, this should be an impulse buy unless you hate wizards, witches or casting spells. Prepare to make a name for yourself as the youngest wizard with the highest killcount in history.
* **Star Wars Jedi Survivor (-60%, $27.99)** – PS4 version surprisingly costs more. This is the version to get. Souls but with a Jedi flavor. Better than the first one in almost every way, and Cal can run properly here. Third game in development, so this is a good time to get into the franchise.
* **It Takes Two (-75%, $9.99)** – Goes on sale almost every other week. Definitely worth it, but just bear in mind you need a co-op partner to play this,
* **Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered (-50%, $24.99)** – Rarely goes on sale, and this isn’t a bad price at all. If you haven’t played this franchise yet, now might be a good start.
* **Cyberpunk 2077 (-40%, $29.99)** – Rocky launch, but now in a stable state. This is what CDPR envisioned for the game. Definitely worth a buy now.
* **Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC (-15%, $25.49)** – Jampacked with content. If you’re done with the main story, then pick this up.
* **Red Dead Redemption 2(-67%, $19.79)** – Even if you’re not a fan of Westerns, this is still a must-play. Amazing story, gameplay and loads of Easter eggs. Actually prefer this over GTA5.
* **Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart (-58%, $29.39)** – Amazing platformer, loads of weapons to use. Has that rift mechanic that’s only possible on PS5. Give this a shot.
* **Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League (-80%, $13.99)** – The lowest I’ve seen this on PSN. Might be heading to PS Plus soon? It’s worth a try at that price, but depends on how much you like these type of games. Just be mindful that support should be ceasing soon.
* *Mortal Kombat 11 (-50%, $24.99)* – Possibly the lowest I’ve seen it on PSN so far. Your dose of violence, and latest Khaos Reigns content drop was just released and brings Animalities.
* **Avatar Frontiers of Pandora (-50%, $34.99)** – Might be the lowest it’s been on PSN without a bundle. Ubisoft’s formula but with an Avatar coating. Better than expected.
* **Still Wakes the Deep (-33%, $23.44)** – Fairly new. Have this but haven’t started yet. Surprised to see it here this fast.
* **Cuphead (-30%, $13.99)** – DLC is also on sale. Gorgeous visuals, tight controls but hard as hell.
* **F1 24 (-50%, $34.99)** – Latest F1 game from Codemasters. If you’re a fan, then this is a good buy.
* **The Last of Us Part 1 Digital Deluxe (-38%, $49.59)** – Just in case you haven’t played this, still a bit high.
* **WWE 2K24 (-50%, $49.99)** – Free this month for PS+, solid wrestling game and still getting DLCs.
* **Skull and Bones (-60%, $27.99)** – Unsure how well this turned out, but apparently there’s enough players to support its seasonal content.
* **Witcher 3 (-75%, $9.99)** – Super low price, and this is one of my all-time fave games. Fantastic side quests, meaty experience all around. Once you get past the floaty controls/combat, and once it clicks, it’s one hell of an experience. Expansion is also on sale and worth the price.
* **Battlefield 2042 (-$85%, $10.49)** – Worth it at that price. Game is in a much better state now than before.
* **AC Valhalla (-75%, $14.99)** – Assassin’s Creed Vikings! Insane amount of content, though overstays its welcome a bit.
* **Borderlands 3 (-90%, $5.99)** – Looter shooter but not live service. Insane action, and a steal at that price.
* **Earth Defense Force 6 (-20%, $47.99)** – If you dig these types of games, might be worth a pickup.
* **The Outlast Trials (-33%, $33.49)** – Multiplayer-focused horror game. Still getting lots of support.
* **GTA The Trilogy (-50%, $29.99)** – Unsure how performance is nowadays. Three games in one in case you want more GTA gaming before GTA6 drops.
* **Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy (-60%, $15.99)** – Crash platforming. Harder than it looks.
* **Mafia Trilogy (-75%, $14.99)** – Three Mafia games in one. Definitely not a bad deal, and there’s a new one on the way.
* **Star Wars Battlefront 2 (-70%, $5.99)** – Definitely worth the price. No content support incoming, but servers still up and someone said here previously that there’s no shortage of players. Fun to smash people around playing as your favorite Star Wars character.
* **LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga (-75%, $14.99)** – Star Wars adventure with Lego humor. Fun to play with kids or your partner.
* **Payday 3 (-60%, $15.99)** – Lowest I’ve seen this on PSN. Not sure if worth it now, but still getting loads of support.
* **Horizon Burning Shores (-50%, $9.99)** – First time I’ve seen this on sale. In case you want more for the game, then this DLC should scratch that itch.
* **Powerwash Simulator (-30%, $17.49)** – Doesn’t go on sale often. Surprisingly fun and getting regular support.
* **Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order (-75%, $9.99)** – If you’re planning on playing the trilogy, then this is your starting point. Lots of backtracking and Cal runs like he has crap in his pants that will never be OK.
* **Dead by Daylight Gold Edition (-40%,$41.99)** – Heavily supported, and DLCs are also on sale. Asymmetrical horror game for those who want something different.
* **Metro Saga Bundle (-85%, $8.99)** – Three games from the Metro franchise at a discounted rate.
* **Far Cry 6 (-75%, $14.99)** – Solid first-person campaign, and stars Giancarlo Esposito as the baddie.
* **Detroit Become Human (-50%, $9.99)** – More of an interactive movie than a game, but still solid. If you haven’t played Quantic’s games, it’s like Supermassive’s titles.
* **Midnight Suns (-75%, $17.49)** – Strategy with Marvel characters. Surprisingly fun even without MCU likenesses, and has solid length and depth.
* **Pacific Drive (-40%, $17.99)** – First-person driving survival game that’s still getting a lot of support.
* **Divinity Original Sin 2 (-65%, $20.99)** – Larian’s breakout hit. If you want your RPGs deep and long.
* **Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition (-20%, $15.99) –** First time this is on sale. If you ever wanted to play the cult classic, then this is the newest way of doing so. You might finish it in time for the sequel which should be coming any day now…
* **Persona 3 Reload Digital Deluxe Edition (-40%, $47.99) –** If you’re looking to play Persona 3, then this is it. Just got it last DLC drop this September as well.
* **System Shock (-40%, $23.99)** – Remake of a classic. SHODAN!
* **For Honor (-85%, $4.49)** – Multiplayer action game but more melee focused. Still getting loads of support after all these years.
* **Flintlock Siege of Dawn (-25%, $29.99)** – AA action game that didn’t sell well. Might be worth a look? Surely will go down in price more in a few months though.
* **Sifu (-60%, $15.99)** – Beat-’em-up but with more modern mechanics. Neat aging system for life, and harder than expected. Fun when you know what you’re doing.
* **Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 Turbocharged (-75%, $12.49)** -Still getting support. If you like your racing games more arcade-y than sim.
* **Hi-Fi Rush (-40%, $17.99)** – Tango’s last game before leaving Microsoft. JP style action-adventure. GOTY contender as well.
* **Mass Effect Legendary Edition (-85%, $8.99)** – Will never not recommend this. Probably my fave RPG trilogy of all-time. You can get your money’s worth with just the first game, but to have your decisions carry over until the last one? Yean, BioWare at their peak!
* **LA Noire (-50%, $19.99)** – Still priced high for an old game. Amazing visuals and makes you feel like a detective.
* **Back 4 Blood (-90%, $5.99)** – Support has ended but still fun if you can round up friends for co-op.
* **Need for Speed Unbound (-85%, $10.49)** – Still getting support somewhat. Arcade racing and has a less serious take on the franchise. Controls feel a bit floaty for me.
* **Banishers Ghosts of New Eden (-30%, $41.99)** – Criminally underrated game. Not AAA, but certain aspects of it do feel AAA. Combat is ists weakest link but it has a lot of content, good story and loads of secrets.
* **Tomb Raider I-III Remastered (-50%, $14.99)** – The old Tomb Raider games but with added sheen. Prepare for pixelated Lara and lots of mindless jumping while shooting.
* **Gotham Knights (-80%, $13.99)** – Underperformed but still fun. At that price, might be worth jumping into it just to test out the combos you can pull off since each character has their own moveset.
* **Lords of the Fallen (-50%, $34.99)** – The reboot. Sequel is in development and the studio pushed out a ton of new features and whatnot.
* **Crash Bandicoot Bundle: N. Sane Trilogy + CTR Nitro-Fueled (-65%, $26.24) –** Crash overload! Platforming and kart racing in a bundle.
* **Titanfall 2 (-75%, $4.99)** – One of the best FPS’ ever made. Play the campaign and jump into the multiplayer to get melted by sweats.
* **Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes (-35%, $32.49)** – Old-school RPG that surprisingly sold and reviewed well. Still getting support and this is the first time it’s on sale on PSN if I’m not mistaken.
* **Shadow of the Tomb Raider (-80%, $3.99)** – Didn’t finish it, but it’s a solid third-person action game. At that price? Yeah, definitely worth a shot.
* **Alone in the Dark (-30%, $41.99)** – Nota successful remake, but not a bad one either. It’s OK. Combat is nothing special and graphics won’t blow anyone away. Ambience is fine, and worth a look for horror fans.
* **A Plague Tale Bundle (-60%, $31.99)** – Don’t play if you get scared of rats, but this is a solid two games and story is well done.
* **Control – (-80%, $7.99)** – Remedy’s pure action game. In the same universe as Alan Wake. This includes the DLCs as well.
* **Hell Let Loose (-40%, $35.99)** – Era multiplayer FPS that’s still getting a lot of support from the devs.
* **The Division 2 Ultimate (-75%, $14.99)** – Fun especially with friends. Includes Warlords of NY expansion. Still getting support and getting new story DLC next year.
* **The Order 1886 (-50%, $9.99)** – Super short but sweet. Loved this when it was released. Amazing visuals then. Shame we won’t see what happens to the tale.
* **Evil West (-60%, $23.99)** – Vampire action game. AA fare but not bad at all. Expect jank and some unpolished visuals but could do worse than this.
* **Cult of the Lamb Cultist Edition (-50%, $14.99)** – Still getting supported. Fun and surprisingly deep. Who knew it was so much fun to have your own cult.
* **Nioh Collection (-58%, $29.39) –** Team Nnja’s Souls game. Hard as nails though, but lots of fans swear how good these games are.
* **Tomb Raider Definitive (-80%, $3.99)** – The first game in the new Tomb Raider trilogy. Solid action games.
* **Rise of the Tomb Raider (-80%, $5.99)** – You can literally get all three games for less than $15.
* **Kena Bridge of Spirits (-60%, $15.99)** – Made waves before. Fun adventure game. Has you collecting hats.
* **Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade (-42%, $3.79)** – If you haven’t played this yet, go get started. Wil make you understand why FF7 is one of the most revered games of all-time.
* **Mega Man X Legacy Collection (-60%, $7.99)** – Includes Mega Man X1-X4. Solid titles from the 32-bit era.
* **LOTR Gollum (-85%, $8.99)** – Lowest I’ve ever seen it on PSN. Promised patches never came. Still not worth it. Buy it if you want to torture your friends.
* **Zombie Army 4 (-90%, $4.99)** – From Rebellion. Content support has ended, but this is a surprisingly fun shooter.
* **Returnal Digital Deluxe (-50%, $39.99)** – Housemarque’s first AAA title. Fun, but might not be everyone’s cup of tea.
* **Outriders Complete  (-35%, $19.49)** – Criminally underrated. Not live service but plays like one. Includes story expansion. Play with friends and you will have a ball trying on different builds.
* **Star Wars Squadrons (-80%, $7.99)** – Support has ended but the most recent game where we can dogfight with Star Wars ships.
* **Anthem (-85%, $2.99)** – Lacks content, but at that price? Might be worth to play through the campaign. Fantastic feeling of flight.
* **Prey (-80%, $5.99)** – Arkane’s finest work according to some.
* **Quantum Error (-50%, $14.99)** – Might get a deeper discount for Halloween. Janky survival horror.
* **Dredge Complete Edition (-20%, $31.59)** – Horror fishing game. Yes, you read that right. Still getting loads of support.
* **Dishonored Death of the Outsider Bundle (-80%, $11.99)** – Arkane’s finest work? Maybe the most popular.
* **Fort Solis (-35%, $22.74) –** More walking simulator than horror. If it worked for Kojima…",https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fzwbkm/playstation_store_fall_savings_promotion_launches/
54,1fxlffo,adtrix101,1728234636.0,Make ranked great again!,2,2,"So, I posted some feedback on the Ubisoft Discord about matchmaking, win/loss streaks, and rank progression in Rainbow Six Siege, and Ubi-Ineradicable suggested I bring the discussion here on Reddit to get more input. So, here we are!

A bit of background: I’ve been playing since the beta, both on console and PC. Lately, it feels like ranked has been getting worse over time, so I finally decided to sit down and figure out what the main issues are and how they could be fixed. I know a lot of people in the community feel the same way, and I thought it’d be good to talk about it here. Let’s hear your thoughts!

I’ve been playing Rainbow Six Siege for quite a while now, and I wanted to share some thoughts about the current Ranked 2.0 system, specifically with matchmaking, win/loss streaks, and how ranks are progressing. I think the changes made were a step in the right direction, but after playing a bunch of ranked matches, there are a few things that don’t feel quite right. I figured I’d share my feedback along with some suggestions.

1. Matchmaking Balance Feels Off

One of the main issues I’ve noticed is that matchmaking often doesn’t feel fair. Even though the system separates MMR from Rank Points, there are huge discrepancies in player skill levels within matches. For example, we were in a match where a Champion 1 player with a 1.8 K/D and 7.8 kills per match was on the same team as a Silver 5 player with a 0.4 K/D and 1.9 kills per match. It makes no sense why these players would even be in the same bracket, let alone the same match. This kind of imbalance often leads to one-sided games, and the players involved don’t get a fair or competitive experience.

The idea behind MMR is great, but it seems like there’s a disconnect between visible ranks and the actual skill level of players. Lower-ranked players like Copper/Bronze are having to fight way above their level, while higher-ranked players get easy wins.

Suggestion:

It would help if matchmaking was stricter in pairing players based on their win/loss ratios and K/D stats. This could make the games more competitive and enjoyable for everyone. Players with much higher hidden MMR than their current rank should be boosted faster to where they belong instead of staying in lower ranks for multiple games.

2. Win/Loss Streaks Aren’t Rewarding Enough

The way win/loss streaks affect rank progression feels unbalanced. For example, we went on a 9-game win streak, starting at 39 rank points per win, but by the end of the streak, we were only getting 40 rank points. Then, after one loss, our rank points dropped back to 39, followed by a 3-game win streak that stayed at 39 rank points. After another loss, our rank points fell further to 37. It feels like losses are punished much more than wins are rewarded, making progression feel slow and frustrating.

Suggestion:

Introducing a win streak bonus where consecutive wins are rewarded with extra Rank Points would make progression feel more rewarding. This would help counterbalance the frustration of losing rank after just a few bad games, especially when players are putting in consistent performances.

3. ""Ranked 2.0 is Better than 1.0 Because Matches End in Overtime"" Argument

During the announcement of Ranked 2.0, Ubisoft developers mentioned that more matches are now ending in overtime, which was used as a justification for why the new system is more balanced and competitive. However, while teams may appear to be better matched overall, there’s still a huge imbalance within the teams themselves. For example, in the match mentioned earlier, the Champion 1 player with a 1.8 K/D and 7.8 kills per match dominated, while the Silver 5 player with a 0.4 K/D and 1.9 kills per match struggled to keep up. This kind of disparity between top and bottom fraggers happens across both teams, making the ""more matches go to overtime"" argument feel misleading.

Just because a match ends in overtime doesn’t mean it’s balanced. Often, one or two players carry the team, and the others struggle to keep up, which doesn’t reflect a truly competitive or balanced experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1fxlffo/make_ranked_great_again/

Not a lot of games in this sale, and you can check the full list to know what's available.

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is at from $79.99 to 54.39 for a limited time.

**Recommendations:**

* **GTA 5 - (67%, $19.79)** - For maybe the 2-3 people that still doesn't own this, now's your chance, as it doesn't get lower than this. Perhaps if GTA 6 is nearing launch maybe it will? But do you want to wait that long?
* **WWE 2K24 (-50%, $59.99)** - This game is free on PS Plus for October. If you aren't a member of PS Plus, then yeah, this is a solid wrestling game which has DLCs on the way.
* **Hogwarts Legacy Digital Deluxe (-70%, $23.99)** - Fun game regardless if you're a Harry Potter fan or not. No co-op or multiplayer of any kind but it lets you live the dream of becoming a mass murdering machine like Voldemort.
* **The Crew Motorfest (-60%, $27.99)** - Still getting support to this day. If you want a more arcade-y racing game.
* **AC Mirage (-50%, $24.99**) - Last year's Assassin's Creed game. Might not have made as big of a thud than Valhalla, but sitting at a generally favorable score at [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/assassins-creed-mirage/).
* **Red Dead Redemption 2 (-70%, $29.99)** - Some might not believe or like it, but this is even better than GTA 5. Fantastic story, engrossing side missions and loads of secrets. You can kill of racist mobs, get anal raped, encounter a vampire and more!
* **Madden 25 (-35%, $64.99)** - Your yearly NFL sim. Can't say if it's good or not since I'm not a football fan but if you're thinking of getting this one, then here you go.
* **Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League (-80%, $19.99)** - Season 3 just launched, but can't really say if this is worth it, since chances are, this will be on PS+ soon?!
* **Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (-55%, $40.49)** - Follow up to the Fallen Order, and better in almost every way. Cal doesn't run around like he has poop in his pants, backtracking issue has been more or less resolved. There's a third one on the way, so if you played the first one, then go pick this one up.
* **Borderlands 3 Next Level Bundle (-90%, $6.99)** - Includes a crapload of DLC and whatnot. Loads of Borderlands stuff are on sale, which fans might wnat to check out. This is well worth the purchase for those looking for some co-op loot action, and there's a free PS5 upgrade available as well.
* **A Way Out (-80%, $5.99)** - Usually on sale alongside It Takes Two, so no rush in getting it. Remember: this is a mandatory co-op game, so if you don't have anyone to play this with, don't bother.
* **Avatar Frontiers of Pandora (-50%, $39.99)** - Ubisoft open word in Avatar! All kidding aside, better than expected. The Gold Edition which includes the DLCs are also on sale.
* **Hi-Fi Rush Deluxe (-40%, $23.99)** - Tango's last game for Microsoft. GOTY contender and generally a different beast than what we usually get. Worth a pick up, but YouTube it first since the aesthetics, etc. might not be a fit for what you're looking for.
* **Midnight Suns (-75%, $19.99)** - Strategy Marvel game. Fun, good length and challenging. Not MCU but proves Marvel franchise can work in almost any genre as long as done right.
* **LEGO Star Wars Skywalker Saga Deluxe Edition (-75%, $17.49)** - Lighthearted Star Wars game you can play with friends or your kids. Familiar LEGO gameplay so expect loads of humor.
* **Mafia 3 Definitive Edition (--75%, $7.49)** - Period GTA but with a better story. There's a new one out next year, so if you want to get on-board this might be the time. Mafia 2 is also on sale for the same price.
* **AC Valhalla (-60%, $15.99)** - Viking Creed! Good action game, but be prepared to sink a lot of time into this.
* **Red Dead Redemption + RDR2 Bundle (-45%, $54.99)** - Not sure about RDR1 performance, but from a gameplay standpoint, should still hold up somewhat.
* **Gotham Knights (-80%, $17.99)** - Support has ended but the game is technically complete. Bat Family are the stars here and you can pull off some insane combos. Might be a bit repetitive, but not a bad game.
* **Back 4 Blood (-90%, $8.99)** - Zombie co-op FPS! Fun with friends. Support has ended, but servers are still up.
* **Alien Isolation The Collection (-85%, $5.99)** - Horror done with the Aliens franchise. Don't expect Resident Evil action, but loads of tense moments. Pick it up if you dig horror games.
* **XCOM 2 Collection (-90%, $9.99)** - Strategy game featuring guns, aliens and did I say strategy?! Not an easy game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fw64n3/psn_store_weekend_offer_sale_for_oct_4_launched/

I loved this game, it is arguably one of my top 5 of all time. The fact that someone can do this in a ranked game at all, let alone be allowed to play ranked to begin with (because this clearly isn’t the first time they’ve done this) is insulting. You might as well spit in the face of the player-base.

At this point team-killing just needs to be removed as well as having the ability to affect your own team with gadgets and secondaries. the only purpose these features have at this point is to perpetuate griefing. 

Ranked is a joke, this is the only competitive game that you can put hundreds of hours into and solo queue into a ranked game, be consistently the best player in the lobby and never actually go up in rank because of the horrible teammates you get paired with no matter your own personal performance.

This clip is from last week, I took a few days to marinate on it and give the game another chance. After playing today I’ve realized that I don’t love Rainbow Six Siege anymore, I love the idea of Rainbow Six Siege. I’ve deleted this game and honestly don’t want to ruin the good memories I have from playing it, and for that reason, I have officially played Siege for the last time!",https://v.redd.it/mf8yovecqxrd1

59,1fs9fvm,noswag15,1727630181.0,Things that are not being talked enough about ubisoft's anti-consumer practices ? ,8,20,"I am a bit concerned about how this whole ubisoft fallout is going to play out. Not because I don’t think they deserve it which they absolutely do, but because the online discourse seems to be heavily focused on a few specific mistakes that they’ve been making. And while the things that are being talked about are things that need to be talked about, I am barely seeing any mention of issues like single player games requiring internet to play, the requirement to have a dedicated launcher that gets in the way of playing a game that I own in every possible way, the aggressive and borderline illegal pushing of stuff that requires gamers to spend more money to do even basic things on games that they’ve bought and already fully paid for, their employees asking gamers to be comfortable not owning games to name just a few.

I feel like ubisoft is finally waking up and starting to think about making amends but when no one talks about these deep rooted issues, I feel like the company is going to get the wrong (or insufficient) feedback/message and continue to fail. If I am being honest, I want them to succeed because they make some of my most favourite games but the way they’re doing it is clearly not working.

So I wanted to highlight a few things that \*personally\* irk me. I am sure there are more and some of the issues may not resonate with some and that’s fine. So in no particular order, these are the things that bother \*me\* (and I’m sure several other gamers).

Why does ubisoft lump every gamer into one category and treat us all like shit ? I get it Ubi, you’re a business and you need to make money and when you see people illegally acquiring your products, it might be disheartening so if you want to take measures to prevent or reduce that, by all means go ahead and do it, but can you please not make is so annoying that you end up discouraging people who actually want to buy and play the games ?

When I buy a single player game, I just want it to be installed on my machine and clicking on it should take me straight to the game. Why should I wait for the clunky and ugly launcher to show up an ugly black empty store page and have to stare at it till whatever checks need to be performed and then wait so long till I can actually get to the game’s menu. And especially when there’s an update to either the game or the launcher, I now have to wait even more and click yes to a bunch of UAC prompts and once everything is done, it forgets my login and I have to login every single time. I just want to play my single player game on my gaming handheld device but no .. I have to fumble with entering a long 20 character mix of numbers symbols and hieroglyphs on a tiny virtual keyboard to even get to the next stage. I could install password managers (which I obviously don’t want to on a gaming handheld) to make it easier but I still need to copy and paste the password.

Why can’t I just play the game offline? If a check needs to be performed, do it on some schedule and clearly show when the last check was done and how much longer I have before the next check locks me out. Give options for me to extend the verification by performing an adhoc check so that I can briefly connect to the internet during my travels and “top-up” my access. There are ways to implement validation checks while still maintaining good user experience for legitimate users but it saddens me that the company’s knee-jerk reaction is to implement aggressive checks at the cost of UX for the honestly majority of users. The verification checks themselves .. why do they have to be tied to ubisoft launcher at all ? Why not have a separate lightweight headless process that performs the checks in the background when the game is loading before the menu is shown ? Surely a company as large as ubisoft can figure out a way, right ?

Why is there no update on issues that plague existing games ? Does there have to be million games released in quick succession before the previous ones are even done ? I bought avatar frontiers of pandora and while the reception has generally been lukewarm, I absolutely had a blast playing and sunk around 100 hours in it. \*had\* being the keyword here because the game has suddenly stopped working and asks me to purchase the skybreaker DLC to even play the base game that I’ve already paid for. How is this even legal ? I wanted to give ubisoft the benefit of doubt and thought that this is probably a recently introduced bug that will quickly be patched but no .. looks like this issue is widespread and has been open for months and ubisoft knows about it but still there is no information about when or if it will ever be resolved.

Which brings me to the whole “forced updates” and lack of options to delay or deny updates. Games are software and software will have bugs no matter how well it’s implemented or tested but the audacity of ubisoft to think that they’re infallible, that their servers will never go down and that they will never have bugs when the reality is exactly the opposite is a clear indicator of some evil force within the company that’s acting against well meaning stakeholders. Because there’s no way that actual developers who slog day and night to create these games don’t know about these limitations and the gamers also know these because they face these routinely. So it looks like ubisoft’s management is absolutely out of touch and is in the middle of this whole mess because it’s pretty clear that the management made decisions to rush out unfinished products. Even worse is the complete silence and the way the company just shrugs it off as business as usual. No wonder people don’t trust ubisoft. Something drastically needs to change in order to win back the lost trust.

Why do I HAVE to login to a ubisoft account to play assassins creed on a playstation 5 ? It slowly crept in. First it was not required at all. Then an option to login was added but was not mandatory. Then with Valhalla, it suddenly became mandatory to login to a ubisoft account in order to play a game that I bought on playstation ? Why ? It got so annoying that eventually I caved and logged in, only to have a severely degraded experience. The game which was buttery smooth before on PS5 started to have micro stutters every now and then. Not to mention all the useless avenge quests bugging out and constantly bombarding the screen with crap like “XYZ has been slain. Avenge their death” or something along those lines. More filler padding on an already padded game just doing the same thing over and over again. It got to a point that I couldn’t do a single action in the game without the same “avenge” notification popping up with an annoyingly loud sound (I am talking like a notification every second type frequent). I dropped the game right there and never looked back. Why do I not have an option to say “no” to the forced login ? why can’t I just peacefully play the game (which I paid a premium for) in peace ?

Engage with the users more actively please ? Don’t treat users as cash cows to milk till death, eh ? Why not have an honest conversation like a reddit AMA or some channel that the company is comfortable with and take criticism constructively instead of gaslighting everyone ? Sure, there are always going to be people who take it too far with their criticism but the solution is not to assume everyone is like that and turn a blind eye. In fact, there’s so much backlash because there are so many problems and while some people may not know how to voice them properly, it’s absolutely important to listen to the ones that are willing to have a discussion and willing to provide feedback ? Why not be transparent when issues are reported by acknowledging them and giving routine status updates instead of leaving users hanging ? Isn’t that basic courtesy to show to people who have trusted the company enough to spend their time and money in ?

Do better Ubisoft.

P.S. I posted this on r/gaming but got removed saying I need to already be an active contributor on the sub to make posts so I'm trying my luck here. Hope I'm not breaking any rules (I have checked the sidebar).

TLDR; There is no perfect company and it's impossible to please everyone and every company inadvertently upsets a few of them but somehow ubisoft has managed to upset a vast majority of its consumers with a wide variety of issues but only the DEI and lack of polish are being talked about while the other issues are not being talked about enough.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fs9fvm/things_that_are_not_being_talked_enough_about/
60,1frjbm5,zaza991988,1727544179.0,Ubisoft make me sad,69,93,"The obligatory thing to say is that I am not a hater, and I own so many Ubisoft games from their major franchise (AC, Ghost Recon, Far Cry, watchdogs, Prince of Persia, The Crew, The Division...)

In the last few years, you have noticed a drop in the gameplay quality of their games. I have a tolerance for long games if they are well-made. I truly enjoyed AC: odyssey and considered it as one of my favorite Ubisoft games (AC: odyssey should have been the start of another separate franchise that focuses more on mythology-based RPG and not an assassin game), i liked Ghost Recon Wildlands and Breakpoint (after the patches). I enjoyed Far Cry 6 and the division series.

Ubisoft art direction and environmental artists are truly some of the best in the industry and capable of releasing amazing-looking games that run well year after year. The cities they create feel very authentic.

Ubisoft also has good gameplay systems, from how the weapons feel and perform, to how the combat flows, to the additional tools they give you to take several scenarios. to usually decent progression system that let you feel more powerful at times goes on

The stories they tell aren't bad, but aren't great either, almost every Ubisoft game follows the same formula, a starting locked-off area that teaches you game mechanics, then three (or more) independent separate areas with separate stories and characters that you can take in any order, and then a final confrontation.

If I have to summarize what makes games turn away from Ubisoft games are constant small frustrations that eventually add up to makes the game feels like a chore to play. Let’s give you some examples.

you can take a look at Far Cry 6 with repeated quest design, and removal of leveling up perks instead of sticking them to clothing pieces each scattered on a different part of the map behind puzzles or enemy camps. Or the not-present main villain, or the fact best gear is hidden behind a paywall.

Almost every Ubisoft game's best weapons and abilities are hidden behind a paywall. Their games are built around frustrating/edging you enough to shell out extra in-game monetization for a game that you already paid for. I am here wondering how much extra money are they making in these MTX console/PC games ? 

Every Ubisoft game must have a merchant that doesn’t take the regular currency, but only takes a premium currency that either has to grind for an unreasonably long time with random weekly reward.

Or selling a complete edition or ultimate edition of the game that doesn’t contain all the content, and you expected to fork extra money on that.

Not to mention the online requirements for single-player games, live services for most Ubi games and finally removing content from your library that you paid for.

All these frustrations add up to gamers automatically feeling like they are about to get screwed because Ubisoft has done so repeatedly in the past.

Some Ubisoft games feel off is that in most cases gameplay systems don't work well together.

In LoZ:Botw almost every upgrade is behind a temple puzzle, but these puzzles are diverse enough with a separate theme that allows challenge your problem-solving skills, different combat skills, timing skills, or creativity and the game gives you all the tools to do that early on.  AC: Valhalla obviously tries to copy the idea of a puzzle behind weapon and upgrade but you end up with a badly designed puzzle that is either not properly introduced, or just looking around to find an opening from an angle to shoot a lock so you can enter a door to shoot another lock to get to a lame rewards (ingots). And the best/coolest rewards (weapons/armors) are hidden behind a paywall. What makes matters worse is that you will spend more time than you like just to find the angle from where you want to shoot because of the game's dense geometry and the art style. Or the never-ending skill tree that is filled with +1% damage while (random action)…. It just feels disrespectful of your time. Even Immortal: fenyx rising suffers from a similar puzzle design but to a slightly lesser degree. These games just feel constantly frustrating you so go and buy ingots from the store using real world money

Or stealth section in star wars outlaws where you don’t have any stealth tools and broken line of sight system.

Or shallow characters and repetitive missions in every Ubisoft game that the writers of the game think they are amazing and cool.

And this makes me sad. Most Ubisoft games aren’t bad, they are a company that targets a 7/10 or 8/10 game that hasn’t released anything a real GOTY in the last decade. It feels like maybe if they spend more time polishing the gameplay systems, better writing,  and better quest design they can end up with solid games every time because you can see the potential. Ubisoft feels like the smart kid in highschool class, who is set to do the bare minimum to get a passing grading that you know can ace the exam if they make the effort, but after a long time doing these, you started wondering if that can even recover because of their bad habits. That is why their games always go on sale soon after launch because no one wants to pay the full price for a game they have played before with a different skin on top, especially when you know another one in releasing in few month that will end up a similar experience. The best way to enjoy a Ubisoft game is to take a long break between their franchise and that what I think instinctively we are doing as gamers.

I hope this message finds you well.  
  
***Me:*** I am respectfully requesting a reconsideration of the decision to deny my request to unlink my Ubisoft account from Steam. As mentioned, I believe I was approved for a one-time exception to unlink the account, and I have already provided the necessary verification for this process. I understand there may be limitations, but I would greatly appreciate further clarification on what specific policies or technical issues are preventing this unlinking.  
  
Additionally, I would like to emphasize the technical difficulties I am experiencing when launching Rainbow Six Siege via Ubisoft Connect, which results in my computer freezing. This issue significantly impacts my gameplay experience, and playing through Steam has been the most stable solution for me. I've never been able to play through Steam on my main account. Therefore, I kindly request a second review of my case or guidance on how I might proceed, as the current situation is not only frustrating but also prevents me from fully enjoying the game.  
  
If there are any further steps I can take to assist in resolving this issue, or if escalating this case for further review is possible, I would appreciate your assistance.

***Me:*** Subject: Request for Further Review and Escalation – Case #21814309  
  
Dear Ubisoft Support,  
  
Thank you for your prompt response. I understand that there are technical limitations and internal policies in place regarding my request to unlink my Ubisoft account from Steam.  
  
Given that I am experiencing critical technical issues when launching Rainbow Six Siege through Ubisoft Connect (resulting in frequent freezes), I kindly request that my case be escalated to a senior support agent or manager for further review. I have never been able to play the game through Steam on my main account, and resolving this would greatly enhance my experience.  
  
Additionally, if unlinking is not possible due to these limitations, are there any alternative solutions, such as transferring game data or achievements between my Ubisoft accounts, that could help resolve this issue?  
  
I appreciate your time and consideration, and I hope to find a solution that allows me to fully enjoy the game.

***Me:*** Dear Ubisoft Support,  
  
Thank you for your continued assistance with my case. I appreciate your efforts to address my concerns regarding the technical issues I am experiencing with Rainbow Six Siege.  
  
I understand the limitations regarding unlinking accounts and the five-strike policy in place. However, I would like to kindly request further assistance in exploring any possible alternatives that could help resolve my situation. I'd like to ask where the five-strike policy is located in the code of conduct. I didn't know there was such a rule in place. I apologize for the behaviour that caused me to receive a strike. I'm only trying to solve the issues present so I can play Rainbow Six Siege without having to worry about my PC crashing.  
  
Given that I have experienced critical freezing issues when launching the game through Ubisoft Connect, I have taken some steps as advised, such as updating my graphics drivers and verifying game files. Unfortunately, these measures have not resolved the problem, and I am still only able to launch the game using the Vulkan desktop icon.  
  
I would greatly appreciate any additional guidance or support you could provide, including:  
  
Suggestions for troubleshooting the freezing issue further.  
Possible solutions for linking my original Ubisoft account to Steam, or any alternative methods to ensure I can fully enjoy the game without interruptions.  
Thank you for your understanding and support. I look forward to your response.

Dear Ubisoft Support,  
  
I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to clarify my previous communication regarding my account. I reached out initially from my main account, ScytheFR, and I am currently trying to unlink my separate account, ScytheGA, from Steam.  
  
I intended to seek assistance without causing any confusion, and I am concerned that responding from ScytheGA might lead to misunderstandings or additional strikes under the five-strike policy. I am not fully aware of the behaviours that may result in strikes, and my goal is to resolve the technical issues I am experiencing with Rainbow Six Siege.  
  
Could you please clarify if responding from a different account may have any consequences? I would appreciate your guidance on how to proceed without jeopardizing my case further.

Great start to the season Ubisoft🎉",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1fdrs6d/game_performance_on_pc/
64,1fgvfh5,Unable-Literature671,1726346359.0,"We're screwed anyway, let's talk about our WD4 delusions.",27,42,"Just like I said. ""Star Wars: Outlaws"" seemed to have a decent performance, but it fell short of the revival of Ubisoft.

This means that Ubisoft will move toward saving money by excluding future planned follow-ups.

In the meantime, I decided to write because I wanted to unravel my thoughts on WD4.

I thought about so many things, but it's a shame that I can't forget it like this.

First, let's talk about the starting point for the character.

The main character is either a college student who is good at hacking or just graduated from college. He has excellent hacking skills and inexperienced engineer skills.

And he have a very lively, close friend or family I've known for a long time, who resembles Wrench's personality.

Here, I'll call the above person ""N"" from now on.

N wasn't good at hacking and was always inexperienced, but he got along well with the main character because of his excellent engineer skills.

That's how the main character was supposed to meet N in the evening,

Just before meet, N across the street from the traffic light dies in an accident.

There are various causes such as bombing accidents, vehicle autonomous driving errors, and terrorism.

""But"" N's accident is a murder disguised as an accident. He doesn't know it yet.

The main character finds N's smartphone while organizing N's belongings.

And I hack to unlock my smartphone with N's lock on it.

After unlocking N's smartphone, the main character sees a picture of N's smartphone memories of each other, but N's smartphone messenger gets a notification.

""Yo. Why didn't you log in? I've been waiting for you so long :(""

So the protagonist meets with a team member from one of the few remaining Dedsec branches that survived the enormous ""Blume"" crackdown and online detection after Watchdogs 2.

also thought about this intermediate process, but I didn't write it down because I thought the story would be too long.

Now, shall we introduce the ""Refresh"" Dedsec character that has barely survived?

First, character K with a similar position to our Wrench and Jordi. 😎

K is a good match for N, and he's the one who helped N join Dedsec.

K's specialty is a character who can act like the main character.

So, he's a character who can investigate while working separately with the main character in the future.

K is a very easy person to get things related to guns and car computer parts. Isn't it amazing?

Now, let me introduce the character O.

O is a very cautious friend. O's specialties are 2D, 3D art, and hacking

I think O's appearance will remind me of Overwatch's mei.

Or the García of Criminal Minds comes to mind.

and She have long black hair. She like black Cloth very much, but not Goth.

But she wears a mask or mask every day and always uses a voice modulator when talking to strangers.

She hides himself from other Dedsec members besides the Dedsec members he met himself in person.

Oh, don't get me wrong. O doesn't have a scar. It's just that she hates lifting herself up.

She's a timid personality, but she does this for a reason. We'll learn from her assistant duties in the future.

However, O's hacking skills are excellent, so can't ignore them.

An essential figure in the online war using data research and AI Bot.

Let me introduce you to Y.

Y is similar to the role of a leader. It's a secret, but he always waiting in Dedsec.

Y is careful and cautious in speaking, but the moment the protagonist falls into a crisis, he makes a quick judgment and response to get him out of the crisis.

Lastly, it's a character named X.

X is kind of like a police officer and a soldier.

I'm in a bit of a hurry and I'm trying to act, but I think it's related to the crime syndicate or Blume that's coming up.

X later betrays Dedsec in the middle of the game, or misunderstands Dedsec. There must be a reason, right?

I want to talk more, but since it's a space for everyone, I just wrote down what came to mind.

Do you guys have any WD4 settings or characters in mind?",https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/1fgvfh5/were_screwed_anyway_lets_talk_about_our_wd4/
65,1fg9oiq,uglyexpert,1726273238.0,Possible fix for new Dx12 fps drops/ stuttering (AMD),5,1,"People are experiencing some serious performance issues in R6's new Dx12 api. I searched the internet for solutions, and after a few hours came up with nothing. I have narrowed it down to the game either not shader caching properly, or not caching at all. 

I then decided to pull out the old AMD trick up my sleeve, by going into the registry to ""force"" caching on. I fired up siege after restarting, and after giving the benchmark a few runs I think the issue is partially solved. 

Pretty much you want to go to this in your registry (just search registry in the windows bar if you're unfamilliar): Computer\\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Class\\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\\0000\\UMD 

Scroll down to the ""ShaderCache"" file, double click and change the number to 32 (cache forced on). It most likely will be set to 31 on its own (amd optimized). Restart pc and go back to siege.

What your game should now be doing is actually storing the shader cache the game is processing (thats my theory, Im not very smart). Give the benchmark a few runs and see if the fps drops persist.

I haven't gotten the game to run as stable as vulkan still (explosions still induce stutter, same with scene switches on the benchmark), but it definitley feels like its playable now. You will HAVE to deal with fps drops with any new operator, map, or other assets for a little while. But at least now its not for nothing, once the shaders compile it should become much better over time. 

I hope someone at ubisoft will read this (its only a dream) but please for the love of god bring back vulkan. Why you would remove a part of the game that worked flawlessly is beyond my paygrade. 

For nvidia users, I have found a few ""fixes"" on this sub, but as of now most people can't resolve the issue (reading the comments section)

This won't make the game run as smooth as it used to, but hopefully I can at least help one person facing this issue. Please leave a comment if this works. Comment if it doesn't aswell, I'm on the hunt to make siege run like it used to. Ubisoft is currently investigating this issue, and I urge you all to upvote this thread: [https://r6fix.ubi.com/projects/RAINBOW6-SIEGE-LIVE/issues/LIVE-63744](https://r6fix.ubi.com/projects/RAINBOW6-SIEGE-LIVE/issues/LIVE-63744) I have a bad feeling that Ubisoft is going to half ass this fix, as they have already released this update after people complained about the same thing on the test server.

66,1femo0o,InbrainInTheMemsain,1726092664.0,Why is this game so bad?,5,0,"One of my biggest issues with Siege is that, we are in Year 9, more than half way through at this point. 

I am gonna bitch a bit, but there is a tl;dr if you wanna skip.

Is anyone else troubled by the lack of polish this game has? There's so much little issues and problems, consistent audio issues, a new invisible glitch, the new character constantly T-Poses on spawn, there's been massive hit-reg issues lately, consistent visual/had issues. PC removed Vulkan and the game is basically a stuttery mess right now. They significantly cut down on adding new content to make fixes which have not come, any events have been reused, with recycled and recolored skins. 

They confirmed being able to detect MnK on console but won't do anything about it and mousetrap is ridiculously easy to get around by design. On PC, cheaters will literally run streams, ""Day 89 of R6 while blatantly cheating"" and laugh because it's funny to them how bad the anti-cheat is. On both, you'll have people with ridiculously bloated w/l or k/d ratios which you can definitely use to fairly reliably locate both smurfs and cheaters, you'll have players whose account names are literally ""I am cheating at this game, but Ubisoft won't do shit"" while they blatantly cheat and Ubisoft will ""no idea how to find cheaters, *shrug*."" 

I get the MnK/Cheater situation isn't specific just to R6, it's a huge issue with gaming in general, but Ubisoft has such a bad approach to this it demands being called out.

My biggest thing is, the game lacks any refinement with its changes too. Anyone with half a brain can tell you a lot of the changes they make to the game make no sense. Ubisoft will constantly shoot themselves in the foot time and time and time again because they have no idea how to balance their operators properly. For example, Ash is over-picked, slightly over-performing, what do we do? Nerf the R4-C? Okay, but that will now also negatively affect Ram, who is pretty balanced as far as ops go, and Ram doesn't need any nerfs/buffs at this point. Maybe nerf Ash's gadget or speed? Nah, just take 5 bullets away from both of them. 

One of the biggest issues is nerfing an operator based off of just presence alone. With the exception of Jager, who has received several merciless kicks to the dick, changing an operator based off of their over-appearance in matches is just a stupid idea, especially if they're not over-performing by any large means. On both Console and PC, Ash is the most picked attacker, but has a relatively low success rate for such a picked character, whereas someone like Sens, on both Console and PC is by far the worst attacker based on both win and presence %. For all intents and purposes, I'd understand a massively underpicked/under-performing operator needing more attention than an overpicked but not exactly stellar performing op.

This is absolutely just my takes on a few things, I'm a huge fan of the game but damn dude, shit sucks. All that Ubisoft is doing is finding more and more ways to monetize the game while the devs fail to deliver on promised changes, the game remains broken, but hey, don't forget there's some nice perks for the membership.

The game is over nine fucking years old, why does it feel like a just off early access mess when it's the big game basically keeping Ubisoft off the ground. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1femo0o/why_is_this_game_so_bad/

I'd like to make a post where everyone can share their thoughts about the new patch's (Y9S3) DirectX 12 update and Vulkan remove.

I played siege with Vulkan for a very long time on all of my previous setups and on the recent too. With the new update i had to make a decision to change for DX12 with keeping all the GPU specified features ingame settings like (NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR) or NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency settings OR change to the old DX11 and losing all the settings what may reduces the GPU's performance without these settings.  
I use DX11 now, because the DX12 is cut my FPS to half and it has microlags, they will fix the microlags for sure with micropatches in a week but it wont solve the huge FPS issues.  
Here is my recent setup:  
Razer Blade 15 2022 Intel 12800H + RTX 3070 Ti + 16GB RAM  
FPS numbers in the game with PRO settings (everything on Low except shadow and LOD quality):  
DX12: around 145 FPS

DX11:  Fix 240 FPS (I capped it to the monitor because of G-Sync, but without it it can reach 260 FPS)

I know its practice mode, but i have the same numbers in normal game too.

69,1fcop2r,rebel761,1725886367.0,Ubisoft Shares Slump After Investor Urges Assassin’s Creed Maker to Go Private,55,72,"Shares of [Ubisoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FR/UBI?mod=ANLink) Entertainment plunged Monday after a minority investor called for the maker of the Assassin’s Creed videogame franchise to go private and install a new management team.

AJ Investments, a hedge fund based in Slovakia that holds less than 1% in Ubisoft, said in a letter to management that it was unsatisfied with the current performance and strategic direction of the company.

Ubisoft has been facing a number of setbacks in recent months. It no longer expects to release “Rainbow Six Mobile” and “The Division Resurgence” in the fiscal year ending in March 2025, saying in July that developers needed extra time to ensure the games meet players’ expectations.

The delays came after the group ceased development of “The Division Heartland,” a decision it made to redeploy resources to bigger releases such as “XDefiant.” Its share price has tumbled more than 50% over the last 12 months. Shares in Paris were down more than 9% on Monday after AJ Investments published its letter to Ubisoft management.

Juraj Krupa, founder and chief executive of AJ Investments, said he wanted the letter to be a wake-up call for other investors. The hedge fund said Ubisoft should go private and urged the founding Guillemot family not to block a sale process. It also called for the installment of a new chief executive willing to weigh the sale of some studios and lay off staff to cut costs.

Ubisoft didn’t respond to a request for comment on the letter.

I miss the days where ubisoft made great games. They put alot of work into all these games. From Clark explaning or briefing u. Siege has some good gameplay. However that where it rainbow six became lazy. Alot easier making multiplayer game. No need to script 20 or missions briefings. It immerse u.  My next game to play is Rainbow Six Critical hour. I do miss stuff from games like Rogue Spear. In the older games u have control of 4 teams . Blue, red, green, orange.  Complex missions requring multiple entries. The newer games felt to much action. I hope the next R6 builds up on its past games. It should have both single player and coop and multiplayer. Ready or Not is what R6 used be like. There is huge market here.  R6 is excellent for cqb. I had some intense firefights. The train station level in lockdown. Gave me trouble. I just wished i had played alot more.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gdv7rp

## Season 2.0

Seasons were introduced to The Division 2 in March 2020 with the release of Warlords of New York. They have become a key aspect of the endgame, however, after four years, this model has reached its limit. To prepare for the game's future, they needed to reevaluate the season model, update it, and equip the game with the right tools to make each season truly unique. 

TU 22 & Seasons 2.0 offers an exciting mix of new gameplay elements, new story, and rewards, all presented in a fresh way that allows for greater creativity and surprise. The main idea behind Seasons 2.0 is to break away from the current seasonal model by transforming the entire experience. 

&nbsp;

### Seasonal Journey Missions

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season’s content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

### Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

&nbsp;

### Manhunt Scouts

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

&nbsp;

### Seasonal Modifiers

=> [Season Modifiers]( https://i.imgur.com/XfduRhn.png)

The Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience.

The modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges.

&nbsp;

###Season Pass 

The optional Season Pass is available for all The Division 2 players starting at Level 1, priced at 1000 Premium Credits ($9.99 or your regional equivalent) in the in-game store and does not require ownership of the Warlords of New York DLC. While accessible from Level 1, please note that the rewards remain locked until Level 40.

Additionally, players can opt for the Premium+ option, available for 3000 Premium Credits ($29.99 or your regional equivalent), which bundles the Premium Season Pass with multiple rewards, offering even greater value.

&nbsp;

=> [SeasonPass]( https://i.imgur.com/BurFjAY.png)

&nbsp;

Players with the Season Pass can gain access to the following premium track rewards: 

*   10 gear dyes
*   10 weapon skins 
*   2 outfits 
*   2 new Prestige Arm Patches

&nbsp;

Moreover, players can earn 400 Virtual Currency by progressing through the Season Pass on the premium track.

But that's not all! Free players now can receive cosmetics in the Season Pass. The free track includes 1 outfit and 1 weapon skin, allowing every Agent to gear up and stand out in the streets of D.C.

##Balancing Pass

###Rework

**Sledgehammer** - Weapon Talent

Dealing damage with a grenade applies a mark on target. Targets with marks will take **15%(20%) more damage to armor** and have a -20% movement speed. Mark disappears after 10 seconds.  
  
_Previously: Dealing damage with a grenade applies a mark on target. Targets with marks will take 30% more damage to armor and have a -20% movement speed. Mark disappears after 10 seconds._

&nbsp;  

**Mosquito Song** - Exotic Pistol

Hitting an enemy applies a stack. Stacks are shared between players. At **5** stacks, the enemy will forcefully target the last player to apply a stack for 5s **and take 25% more damage to armor**. Stacks deplete every 5s. Activating the effect on an enemy will remove all stacks from other enemies.

With TU22 these Rifles and Marksman Rifles are now fully automatic:

&nbsp;

### Balancing - Weapons & Talents, Gear & Brand Sets, Exotic Weapons & Gear

With the introduction of Seasons 2.0, which brings new features like Modifiers, Scouts, Priority Objectives and the Seasonal Journey, we’ve taken a fresh approach to balancing, aiming to give different playstyles more distinct personalities.

This update will address a wide range of elements, including various weapon categories, Exotic weapons and gear, weapon mods, talents, and gear sets.

&nbsp;

### Loot Pool Update

In TU22, a fresh batch of Named Weapons will be added to the loot pool for missions and mission bosses. While the original loot tables remain unchanged, they now offer additional opportunities to obtain these new items.

Although these weapons have a higher drop rate, they are not guaranteed rewards and may require multiple attempts to acquire. The likelihood of these weapons dropping increases with the difficulty level of the mission.

These new loot drop chances are exclusively available for characters at level 40 or above and are limited to regular versions of missions - they do not apply to ""invaded"" missions.

#Shades of Red

Year 6 Season 2: Shades of Red is marking the start of a new seasonal journey. With Aaron Keener in custody at the White House, he aims to strike a deal with The Division. Before Agents can learn what he knows, they have to secure the other members of Keener's team, starting with Theo Parnell.

##SEASONS 2.0

###Seasonal Journey

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season's content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

###Seasonal Modifiers

=> [Season Modifiers]( https://i.imgur.com/XfduRhn.png)

The Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience: 

*   **Global Modifiers** set the overall theme of the season and are active at all times while the system is enabled, affecting the core gameplay loop. 
    *   This season, the theme is ""range."" The Global Modifier, ""Point Blank,"" grants a bonus damage based on distance from enemies. 
*   **Active Modifiers** function like ""ultimate"" abilities, giving your character a short burst of power. 
    *   Players can choose from a selection of Active Modifiers, but only one can be equipped at a time. This season, they manipulate the range zones set by the Global Modifier. 
*   **Passive Modifiers** work in conjunction with the Global Modifier, adding extra bonuses. 
    *   Players can equip up to three Passive Modifiers simultaneously. In the first season, these modifiers provide additional benefits based on the range zones from the Global Modifier. 
*   **Hostile Modifiers:** These represent how the enemies adapt to your new abilities. 
    *   As players progress through the season, enemies will gradually gain new abilities linked to specific enemy types, forcing you to use the Global, Passive, and Active Modifiers strategically to counter them. 

The modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges. 

&nbsp;

###Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

Players can choose from three objectives, selecting one based on limited information such as duration, reward category, and mission type. Once a selection is made, it is locked in, and the full details of the objective and its rewards will be revealed.

If none of the objectives appeal to the player, the system allows for rerolls and has an Abandon Objective feature. Players can earn reroll points by completing Priority Objectives, with a maximum of three rerolls stored at any time.

There is no limit to the number of Priority Objectives a player can complete, and rewards include XP, Season Pass XP, items, resources, and passive modifier unlocks.  

&nbsp;

###Manhunt Scouts

=> [Parnell Manhunt](https://i.imgur.com/khEGjlR.jpeg)

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

Each week, players can tackle a Scout, which consists of three different activities. These activities will vary, and players must solve a small riddle to complete each one. Activities should be completed in order, and once all three are finished, players will receive the Scout Reward.

Once all activities in a Scout are completed, players will receive a bigger reward, including a unique collectible. However, new Scouts cannot be accessed until the current one is completed.

By the end of the season, completing all Scouts unlocks the Manhunt Climax Mission, and finishing that unlocks the Master Climax Mission, so make sure to stay on track each week.

&nbsp;

##GEAR, WEAPONS & TALENTS

81,1g9l6fk,Legal-Guitar-122,1729611608.0,I believe that Ubisoft will surprise us with a game better than CT. ,238,146,"The reason of CT was better than the original SC1, was because the gameplay bring many improvements like stealth score, new mechanics, better AI and more objectives, all this toghether with the amazing level's design. But if we analyze the level's concept + atmosphere of the first SC, they have much more potential and the game also have 2 more missions ( without Training level ). Ubisoft also will bring new improvements in gameplay, maybe even more alternative routes like CT. So the remake would not be just a copy with new visuals. 

Not forghet that the game will be released with a realistic graphic engine never seen before in the old games. Will be like playing Crysis on modern graphics with 4K, 60FPS, Ray Tracing, etc on Xbox/PS/PC. 

* Also it's better the ramake have a slow development to be released very polished on details, without bugs, etc. Fast development majority of times bring problems like AC games. So the fans need more patience for we have the best version in the future. ",https://i.redd.it/nzartcdbvbwd1.jpeg
82,1g97hj5,AintNoLaLiLuLe,1729563460.0,My humble collection and opinions on the series as a whole,141,21,"Day 1 Splinter Cell enjoyer here. This sub has become an absolute cesspool full of copium for a remake that likely won't come out so here's something different for a change.

Originally got into the series exclusively on the PS2 until I got a 360 and then PC - my PS2 copies are long gone. Here are some hot takes and opinions on each installment:

Splinter Cell: The game that started it all, and I'm very fond of it. The graphics and gameplay were unheard of at the time and I spent years playing it as a kid. I've played every version of this game and the PC version is by far the worst, mostly coming down to the awful keyboard/mouse controls. I've got the steam version, Uplay Version, PC disk, and *had* the PS2 & GBA copies at one point in time in my childhood. The best way to play is emulating the PS2 or Xbox version depending if you want the bonus levels on either platform.

Pandora Tomorrow: Weakest game in the series (minus essentials) by a longshot. Horrible controls and lack of support for modern graphics cards (Shadows only render using Voodoo graphics unless you wanna use DGVoodoo. The original SC thankfully has a fallback mode so it's less of an issue) make this game an absolute chore to play on PC. Also, Allstate Lambert sucks. I prefer emulating the PS2 version on my steam deck.

Chaos Theory: The mother of all stealth games! I've sunk quite literally thousands of hours into this game between every version. There is no understating how incredible this game is and it will always be my favourite game of all-time. The PC version is my preferred way to play after some graphics mods and fixed controller support via SCfix. It works great on my gaming PC and steam deck. Honourable mention to the NDS copy of this stellar game (I *used* to have it as a kid and loved it, fight me).

Double Agent: I know this will rustle some jimmies but the 360 version is better than the OG Xbox/PS2 copies of the game, though I really liked those ones too. The jump from Chaos Theory's already amazing graphics to DA when it came out was incredible even though I played them on a 32inch CRT way back in the day. The MP was great, although not as great as CTs. I prefer the 360 version of v1 over the PC strictly because of the bugs and frustrating amount of configuration needed on the PC. I prefer emulating the PS2 version of v2 on the steam deck.

Conviction: I was hyped for years for this game, from when it was just the tech demo we never got to play, to the revised version. Although not the strongest in the series, it was a nice change in pace and co-op/deniable ops were insane to play with my friends and on xbox live. I prefer the PC version primarily because of the graphics and framerate.

Blacklist: Hot take, this is the second best game in the series. I bought every copy of this game, including the Wii U version! Since my PS3 and Wii U copies were digital and those systems are long gone, I didn't get to picture them here. This game was the perfect combination of methodical stealth from traditional entries and the *optional* action of conviction. I've got probably well over 1000 hours between all versions of the game with 400 just in the PC version. I prefer the PC version of this game simply because of the graphics and ability to play it on my steam deck. I'm currently playing through the Chaos Theory mod and its awesome!

Play these games in order and absolutely do not start with Chaos Theory, it will ruin your appreciation for the first 2 games. I've found that if you're playing on PC only, play them like this:

SC 1&2: Emulate the PC/Xbox Versions
SCCT: Play the PC version with SCFix and other fixes here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=728093866
DA: Play the PC version with the fixes here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=935210001
Convicton: Just play the steam/uplay verison
Blacklist: Just play the steam/uplay version

Remake: I want a remake more than anyone in the world, but it's not happening with the current state of Ubisoft. Even if there was a possibility of a remake coming out, why would anyone trust modern-day ubisoft to deliver on this masterpiece of a series? We've seen where other iconic ubisoft franchises have gone in the past decade and I frankly do not want to see another entry if it's going to be full of farcry tower exploration, weak storytelling and shoehorned identity politics. The game is in development hell for a reason and if it's not going to be respectful to the rest of the series and the fans, I don't want it.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",https://i.redd.it/kq2djzf5w7wd1.jpeg
83,1g5568k,Legal-Guitar-122,1729100176.0,In my opinion SC Blacklist is in the top 10 games most underestimated of all time. ,326,88,"The gameplay mechanic is good and fun in many styles ( ghost, panther and assault ) so the player have the freedom to choose their own best style or even mixed the styles during the gameplay, the story is also good, the villain is better than Shetland from Chaos Theory, the new characters like Briggs and Charlie are good, the level's designs in many different locations are good with also day/night/rain/snow, the AI have improvements with less script's and more random movement's in patrols that let the game more difficulty on ghost, the new customization system for Sam outfit/weapons/gadgets are amazing and Ubisoft also bring back co op with many missions. 

The bad thing in the whole game ? The original voice from Sam was changed, but only that not make the game ""bad"". Also was not Ubisoft ""fault"". So in my view and analyze the negative criticizes about the game are very unfair. But that it's only my opinion and you can disagree, so what's actually your general opinion about this game and why ?  

* And I even prefer the 4 first games, maybe because I play them more young ( teen/kid ), while blacklist I only start play when adult. But the game still gold. ",https://i.redd.it/p2duj9kkm5vd1.jpeg
84,1g3y61s,VincentPastor,1728961444.0,"AC Valhalla's detection is not broken, just never explained",56,52,"I'm tired of hearing people claim that ""AC Valhalla's detection is broken, sometimes guards won't see you, sometimes they'll detect you from a mile away."" It's not true. It's just that the rules of detection were never clearly explained.

Now, to be clear, yes, there can be detection bugs at times, it happened 3-4 times in my 250h of gameplay that I got detected through a wall for example. But it's not nearly as prevalent as people say. Like every Ubisoft game, it lacks polish which can be frustrating if you're going for a full stealth run or trying to do perfect mastery challenges , but it's not broken.

So here's a breakdown of how it works:

- At first, detection is pretty easy to play around with. Guards' vision cones are pretty limited and you can kill them easily by sneaking around them or moving fast between cover or attacking from above. Especially if you're in an area or camp where enemies are spread out, it's pretty easy. That's the first layer of stealth.

- Now, the thing about Valhalla is that it changes the rules of detection once you've killed somebody and other guards investigate the area, making it the only AC game where hiding bodies actually matter. Generally, the music will cue will change so you'll know the body is being investigated. From then on, if you are in an enemy's cone of vision, doesn't matter how far or high you are, you will get seen within seconds unless you're hiding behind something or in a bush. This means that you have to be way more careful about how you navigate the area and if an enemy starts detecting you, kill them immediately if you want to stay stealthy. The only way to stay undetected is to either draw an enemy's attention somewhere else or stay right behind them. You'll generally get a sound cue once the investigation is over and enemies are back to the first state of detection.

- The issue with changing the rules of detection is that one, it's never explained to the player, and two you never get a visual indicator like an icon above an enemy's head for example to tell you that they are in investigation mode, making it confusing for most players and leading to people claiming stealth is inconsistent and broken, but again these players just misunderstand the state of the enemy's detection.

- Lastly, for people claiming that camps are not designed for stealth, that is not true. You can generally stealth kill entire camps if you choose to do so. It just presents its own unique set of challenges. Yes, there are sometimes large groups of enemies BUT you can disperse them. The camps are usually designed with either contextual smoke you can trigger by shooting a bag or explosive oil jars. People have claimed the raven is useless, but that's exactly what it's for. Scouting the area for opportunities like that. You can also use your exploding arrow to hurt and disperse a large group. There are people claiming you can't shoot an enemy inside a group without being detected. Again, not true. You can do it, you just have duck back behind cover very fast to avoid detection, that's all. And once you've killed somebody and the enemies are investigating, be careful no one's looking your way if you want to shoot someone else. Otherwise, again, you'll be detected within seconds.

I'm just generally tired of everyone destroying this game and claiming it's the worst thing that ever happened. The game has tons of flaws it's true. It's bloated, it's a representation of some of the worst practices in the video game industry with the micro-transactions, it's got shallow parts and iterates on some ideas from Origins and makes them worse at times. But it's still a game I love with a fantastic world, great story, and some really awesome gameplay mechanics. It lacks polish, yes, but it's not the horrible game the fans say it is. AC III remastered is far buggier and has far less tools to get out of detection for example (I love AC III but the stealth is frustrating).",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1g3y61s/ac_valhallas_detection_is_not_broken_just_never/
85,1g3d8oo,East-Cat4535,1728904305.0,Why I don't buy Ubisoft games anymore,3,39,"Let me preface by saying this is not an Anti-Ubisoft take.  
I used to be a huge fan of Ubisoft games and stopped buying anything from them around 2017.  
Since the very first AC and Farcry2 down to AC:Odyssey. Recently it got myself thinking ""Why did I lost all interest about Ubisoft AAA games ?""  
  
One word sums it all for me: **Surprise.** Or more accuratly, lack of it.

Everytime Ubisoft makes a new AAA I am almost confident it's going to be an Open World action RPG, with map unlocking by going to ""towers"".  
I used to really like that, spent many hours and they are quite fun game even the new ones I am sure, but I just feel like I played way too much of this gameplay loop to keep buying more of it.

I would expect that from the same IP, but I feel like Farcry, AC, Breakpoint, etc all have the same ""feel"" with a different map and main gameplay mechanic (guns, swords etc). But they all ""feel"" the same imo.

Think of the changes between Farcry 1 (I know Ubi is not the dev), Farcry 2 and Farcry 3. All thoose game were very different and caught me by surprise back then. Farcry 4 and 5 all left more or less a twist on FC3.

To sum up, I am an adult now, and I don't have much free time to play like before, and I don't feel like spending that time playing the ""same game"" (yes, this is an exaggeration of my feeling) over and over.

I don't know if orthers quite old folks have the same feeling as I do.

And I wish on the AAA space, Ubi creatives had more freedom like they ocasionnally showcase on smaller titles.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1g3d8oo/why_i_dont_buy_ubisoft_games_anymore/

Seeing how Fortnite is having success with Festival, that got me thinking… What if ubisoft made a spinoff of Just Dance inspired by Harmonix’s Guitar Hero and Rock Band (as well as Festival). Just Fret! Just Fret would be a rock n' roll focused game that would use a guitar controller that would have some purple buttons at the neck near the headstock of the guitar. The graphics could be like a modern day version of rock band 2's and the gameplay could have some twists from Ubisoft yet still being somewhat inspired by Guitar Hero / Rock Band.

88,1g0p9qf,DomFakker37,1728584032.0,I actually love AC: Unity! Sorry (or not?) for being 10 years late.,99,59,"From what I've read, Unity has one of the worst reputations of all the AC games, but if I understand it correctly, the reason for this comes mostly out of the technical issues the game had when it launched back in 2014. I guess I'm glad I did not know anything about the game back then, thus my experience was not ruined.

I just started it recently and the game is amazing! Sure, it gets a little time to get used to, but the visuals are astonishing, the cutscenes are not boring, the story is (despite some small flaws) really good and the missions are rich!

**Visuals:**

The details in faces are almost unbelievable, considering the game came out in 2014. I probably can't name any game that looked that good back in that time except The Witcher or GTA V, which really surprised me. Not only that, the streets of Paris look really good, whether it's the dirty outskirts or the noble houses of the rich people. This is also the first AC game where there is that many pedestrians just randomly doing their stuff and blocking your way. I suppose this is a performance issue, and since this was the first AC released for PS4 (correct me if I'm wrong), I understand that the devs were able to go a step further this time.

**Missions:**

The quests aren't repetitive at all, there was not a single time when I would feel bored. The main story missions are innovative, the side quests are not long, they're simple (that goes to basically every side mission, such as helping your assassin fellows or helping your Social houses etc). I also adore the way the game handles assassinations, it basically gives you multiple options how to enter, how to kill and how to deal with situations. I love that you can simply run at your target and stab them, but you can think your approach through and choose your way of distracting the guards and getting in. There is also not that many tailing missions, which AC series is (mostly negatively) famous for, which I really appreciate.

**Collectibles:**

Another typical AC mechanic (not only, I guess). I remember being tired to death when collecting feathers in Ezio's trilogy. I also hated collecting anything in Connor's game. But Unity? Nothing feels forced. There are chests that have some kind of interaction to it, which is fun. There are cockades that are your typical AC collectible, you usually have to free-run or climb to get them, nothing excessively boring though. And there are side-missions that, as I menitoned, are not long enough to be boring, even though they're sometimes vague thanks to that, so completing them feels good, unlike some previous AC titles.

**Controls:**

They feel clunky when one starts with Unity right after finishing Black Flag and Rogue, and they get some time getting used to, but once you do, the controlled descent is an amazing thing and so is the intentional climbing. I still sometimes jump up instead of jumping down just cause it's not intuitive for me, but I guess I'll learn that. The combat system is not bad at all, even though it's tough for a beginner, who is used to clear fights without even upgrading his weapons, to die after two hits. Not being able to use enemies as Human Shiled and not being able to Whistle is surprising and not a welcome choice, but again, it's not that hard to get used to the new system.

**Coop:**

This is the only thing that I have a problem with, since it seems that [since 30th September, noone has achieved a PS trophy that is strictly linked to coop play](https://psnprofiles.com/trophy/3072-assassins-creed-unity/46-never-say-die). That, sadly, applies to me as well, since I'm unable to connect to anyone, I just get the ""Connection Failed 0x70000006 Error"". And I'm not the only one, many people playing on consoles seem to have the same issue. It seems like the servers are down, even though on Ubisoft's page it says that they're not. I tried going through their PS5 troubleshooting guide and I tried following some random advice from people with similar issue but nothing worked for me. It's a shame, since this is the only thing that prevents me from getting the platinum trophy, but most importantly, I can't enjoy the coop gameplay that I was really looking forward to, especially since I was hoping for something better than that poorly executed multiplayer from Black Flag. I contacted the Ubisoft Support, currently waiting for their reponse, but in case anyone too has this issue, please, let me know.

  
So that's it, that's my post, AC: Unity is awesome and I really hope I'll be able to enjoy 100% of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1g0p9qf/i_actually_love_ac_unity_sorry_or_not_for_being/

* **Hogwarts Legacy (-70%, $20.99)** – PS4 version is a few bucks less, but this is the version to get. At that price, this should be an impulse buy unless you hate wizards, witches or casting spells. Prepare to make a name for yourself as the youngest wizard with the highest killcount in history.
* **Star Wars Jedi Survivor (-60%, $27.99)** – PS4 version surprisingly costs more. This is the version to get. Souls but with a Jedi flavor. Better than the first one in almost every way, and Cal can run properly here. Third game in development, so this is a good time to get into the franchise.
* **It Takes Two (-75%, $9.99)** – Goes on sale almost every other week. Definitely worth it, but just bear in mind you need a co-op partner to play this,
* **Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered (-50%, $24.99)** – Rarely goes on sale, and this isn’t a bad price at all. If you haven’t played this franchise yet, now might be a good start.
* **Cyberpunk 2077 (-40%, $29.99)** – Rocky launch, but now in a stable state. This is what CDPR envisioned for the game. Definitely worth a buy now.
* **Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC (-15%, $25.49)** – Jampacked with content. If you’re done with the main story, then pick this up.
* **Red Dead Redemption 2(-67%, $19.79)** – Even if you’re not a fan of Westerns, this is still a must-play. Amazing story, gameplay and loads of Easter eggs. Actually prefer this over GTA5.
* **Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart (-58%, $29.39)** – Amazing platformer, loads of weapons to use. Has that rift mechanic that’s only possible on PS5. Give this a shot.
* **Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League (-80%, $13.99)** – The lowest I’ve seen this on PSN. Might be heading to PS Plus soon? It’s worth a try at that price, but depends on how much you like these type of games. Just be mindful that support should be ceasing soon.
* *Mortal Kombat 11 (-50%, $24.99)* – Possibly the lowest I’ve seen it on PSN so far. Your dose of violence, and latest Khaos Reigns content drop was just released and brings Animalities.
* **Avatar Frontiers of Pandora (-50%, $34.99)** – Might be the lowest it’s been on PSN without a bundle. Ubisoft’s formula but with an Avatar coating. Better than expected.
* **Still Wakes the Deep (-33%, $23.44)** – Fairly new. Have this but haven’t started yet. Surprised to see it here this fast.
* **Cuphead (-30%, $13.99)** – DLC is also on sale. Gorgeous visuals, tight controls but hard as hell.
* **F1 24 (-50%, $34.99)** – Latest F1 game from Codemasters. If you’re a fan, then this is a good buy.
* **The Last of Us Part 1 Digital Deluxe (-38%, $49.59)** – Just in case you haven’t played this, still a bit high.
* **WWE 2K24 (-50%, $49.99)** – Free this month for PS+, solid wrestling game and still getting DLCs.
* **Skull and Bones (-60%, $27.99)** – Unsure how well this turned out, but apparently there’s enough players to support its seasonal content.
* **Witcher 3 (-75%, $9.99)** – Super low price, and this is one of my all-time fave games. Fantastic side quests, meaty experience all around. Once you get past the floaty controls/combat, and once it clicks, it’s one hell of an experience. Expansion is also on sale and worth the price.
* **Battlefield 2042 (-$85%, $10.49)** – Worth it at that price. Game is in a much better state now than before.
* **AC Valhalla (-75%, $14.99)** – Assassin’s Creed Vikings! Insane amount of content, though overstays its welcome a bit.
* **Borderlands 3 (-90%, $5.99)** – Looter shooter but not live service. Insane action, and a steal at that price.
* **Earth Defense Force 6 (-20%, $47.99)** – If you dig these types of games, might be worth a pickup.
* **The Outlast Trials (-33%, $33.49)** – Multiplayer-focused horror game. Still getting lots of support.
* **GTA The Trilogy (-50%, $29.99)** – Unsure how performance is nowadays. Three games in one in case you want more GTA gaming before GTA6 drops.
* **Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy (-60%, $15.99)** – Crash platforming. Harder than it looks.
* **Mafia Trilogy (-75%, $14.99)** – Three Mafia games in one. Definitely not a bad deal, and there’s a new one on the way.
* **Star Wars Battlefront 2 (-70%, $5.99)** – Definitely worth the price. No content support incoming, but servers still up and someone said here previously that there’s no shortage of players. Fun to smash people around playing as your favorite Star Wars character.
* **LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga (-75%, $14.99)** – Star Wars adventure with Lego humor. Fun to play with kids or your partner.
* **Payday 3 (-60%, $15.99)** – Lowest I’ve seen this on PSN. Not sure if worth it now, but still getting loads of support.
* **Horizon Burning Shores (-50%, $9.99)** – First time I’ve seen this on sale. In case you want more for the game, then this DLC should scratch that itch.
* **Powerwash Simulator (-30%, $17.49)** – Doesn’t go on sale often. Surprisingly fun and getting regular support.
* **Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order (-75%, $9.99)** – If you’re planning on playing the trilogy, then this is your starting point. Lots of backtracking and Cal runs like he has crap in his pants that will never be OK.
* **Dead by Daylight Gold Edition (-40%,$41.99)** – Heavily supported, and DLCs are also on sale. Asymmetrical horror game for those who want something different.
* **Metro Saga Bundle (-85%, $8.99)** – Three games from the Metro franchise at a discounted rate.
* **Far Cry 6 (-75%, $14.99)** – Solid first-person campaign, and stars Giancarlo Esposito as the baddie.
* **Detroit Become Human (-50%, $9.99)** – More of an interactive movie than a game, but still solid. If you haven’t played Quantic’s games, it’s like Supermassive’s titles.
* **Midnight Suns (-75%, $17.49)** – Strategy with Marvel characters. Surprisingly fun even without MCU likenesses, and has solid length and depth.
* **Pacific Drive (-40%, $17.99)** – First-person driving survival game that’s still getting a lot of support.
* **Divinity Original Sin 2 (-65%, $20.99)** – Larian’s breakout hit. If you want your RPGs deep and long.
* **Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition (-20%, $15.99) –** First time this is on sale. If you ever wanted to play the cult classic, then this is the newest way of doing so. You might finish it in time for the sequel which should be coming any day now…
* **Persona 3 Reload Digital Deluxe Edition (-40%, $47.99) –** If you’re looking to play Persona 3, then this is it. Just got it last DLC drop this September as well.
* **System Shock (-40%, $23.99)** – Remake of a classic. SHODAN!
* **For Honor (-85%, $4.49)** – Multiplayer action game but more melee focused. Still getting loads of support after all these years.
* **Flintlock Siege of Dawn (-25%, $29.99)** – AA action game that didn’t sell well. Might be worth a look? Surely will go down in price more in a few months though.
* **Sifu (-60%, $15.99)** – Beat-’em-up but with more modern mechanics. Neat aging system for life, and harder than expected. Fun when you know what you’re doing.
* **Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 Turbocharged (-75%, $12.49)** -Still getting support. If you like your racing games more arcade-y than sim.
* **Hi-Fi Rush (-40%, $17.99)** – Tango’s last game before leaving Microsoft. JP style action-adventure. GOTY contender as well.
* **Mass Effect Legendary Edition (-85%, $8.99)** – Will never not recommend this. Probably my fave RPG trilogy of all-time. You can get your money’s worth with just the first game, but to have your decisions carry over until the last one? Yean, BioWare at their peak!
* **LA Noire (-50%, $19.99)** – Still priced high for an old game. Amazing visuals and makes you feel like a detective.
* **Back 4 Blood (-90%, $5.99)** – Support has ended but still fun if you can round up friends for co-op.
* **Need for Speed Unbound (-85%, $10.49)** – Still getting support somewhat. Arcade racing and has a less serious take on the franchise. Controls feel a bit floaty for me.
* **Banishers Ghosts of New Eden (-30%, $41.99)** – Criminally underrated game. Not AAA, but certain aspects of it do feel AAA. Combat is ists weakest link but it has a lot of content, good story and loads of secrets.
* **Tomb Raider I-III Remastered (-50%, $14.99)** – The old Tomb Raider games but with added sheen. Prepare for pixelated Lara and lots of mindless jumping while shooting.
* **Gotham Knights (-80%, $13.99)** – Underperformed but still fun. At that price, might be worth jumping into it just to test out the combos you can pull off since each character has their own moveset.
* **Lords of the Fallen (-50%, $34.99)** – The reboot. Sequel is in development and the studio pushed out a ton of new features and whatnot.
* **Crash Bandicoot Bundle: N. Sane Trilogy + CTR Nitro-Fueled (-65%, $26.24) –** Crash overload! Platforming and kart racing in a bundle.
* **Titanfall 2 (-75%, $4.99)** – One of the best FPS’ ever made. Play the campaign and jump into the multiplayer to get melted by sweats.
* **Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes (-35%, $32.49)** – Old-school RPG that surprisingly sold and reviewed well. Still getting support and this is the first time it’s on sale on PSN if I’m not mistaken.
* **Shadow of the Tomb Raider (-80%, $3.99)** – Didn’t finish it, but it’s a solid third-person action game. At that price? Yeah, definitely worth a shot.
* **Alone in the Dark (-30%, $41.99)** – Nota successful remake, but not a bad one either. It’s OK. Combat is nothing special and graphics won’t blow anyone away. Ambience is fine, and worth a look for horror fans.
* **A Plague Tale Bundle (-60%, $31.99)** – Don’t play if you get scared of rats, but this is a solid two games and story is well done.
* **Control – (-80%, $7.99)** – Remedy’s pure action game. In the same universe as Alan Wake. This includes the DLCs as well.
* **Hell Let Loose (-40%, $35.99)** – Era multiplayer FPS that’s still getting a lot of support from the devs.
* **The Division 2 Ultimate (-75%, $14.99)** – Fun especially with friends. Includes Warlords of NY expansion. Still getting support and getting new story DLC next year.
* **The Order 1886 (-50%, $9.99)** – Super short but sweet. Loved this when it was released. Amazing visuals then. Shame we won’t see what happens to the tale.
* **Evil West (-60%, $23.99)** – Vampire action game. AA fare but not bad at all. Expect jank and some unpolished visuals but could do worse than this.
* **Cult of the Lamb Cultist Edition (-50%, $14.99)** – Still getting supported. Fun and surprisingly deep. Who knew it was so much fun to have your own cult.
* **Nioh Collection (-58%, $29.39) –** Team Nnja’s Souls game. Hard as nails though, but lots of fans swear how good these games are.
* **Tomb Raider Definitive (-80%, $3.99)** – The first game in the new Tomb Raider trilogy. Solid action games.
* **Rise of the Tomb Raider (-80%, $5.99)** – You can literally get all three games for less than $15.
* **Kena Bridge of Spirits (-60%, $15.99)** – Made waves before. Fun adventure game. Has you collecting hats.
* **Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade (-42%, $3.79)** – If you haven’t played this yet, go get started. Wil make you understand why FF7 is one of the most revered games of all-time.
* **Mega Man X Legacy Collection (-60%, $7.99)** – Includes Mega Man X1-X4. Solid titles from the 32-bit era.
* **LOTR Gollum (-85%, $8.99)** – Lowest I’ve ever seen it on PSN. Promised patches never came. Still not worth it. Buy it if you want to torture your friends.
* **Zombie Army 4 (-90%, $4.99)** – From Rebellion. Content support has ended, but this is a surprisingly fun shooter.
* **Returnal Digital Deluxe (-50%, $39.99)** – Housemarque’s first AAA title. Fun, but might not be everyone’s cup of tea.
* **Outriders Complete  (-35%, $19.49)** – Criminally underrated. Not live service but plays like one. Includes story expansion. Play with friends and you will have a ball trying on different builds.
* **Star Wars Squadrons (-80%, $7.99)** – Support has ended but the most recent game where we can dogfight with Star Wars ships.
* **Anthem (-85%, $2.99)** – Lacks content, but at that price? Might be worth to play through the campaign. Fantastic feeling of flight.
* **Prey (-80%, $5.99)** – Arkane’s finest work according to some.
* **Quantum Error (-50%, $14.99)** – Might get a deeper discount for Halloween. Janky survival horror.
* **Dredge Complete Edition (-20%, $31.59)** – Horror fishing game. Yes, you read that right. Still getting loads of support.
* **Dishonored Death of the Outsider Bundle (-80%, $11.99)** – Arkane’s finest work? Maybe the most popular.
* **Fort Solis (-35%, $22.74) –** More walking simulator than horror. If it worked for Kojima…",https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fzwbkm/playstation_store_fall_savings_promotion_launches/
91,1fyeiss,X-X-XIII,1728324978.0,"From Loyal Fan to Loyal Hater, The Gamers Perspective ",350,514,"I grew up playing Ubisoft games when I got my first Xbox 360. Assassins Creed,Division, Splinter Cell, Far Cry, Rainbow, and Ghost Recon. Splinter Cell has been off the radar since 2014 (Blacklist came 2013). Siege is almost 10 years old. Division only has 2 games and honestly we have the most stable online community in the games in my opinion. Then Heartlands got canceled. And now we're waiting on 3. Still. Far Cry and Assassins Creed fall ill to the same things. ""We"" didn't want level systems and ""looter shooters"". And the story got stale and gameplay repetitive.  Far Cry plots starting at 3: Pirates vs Natives and MC, Dictatorship vs rebels, Cult vs rebels, Dictatorship vs rebels. Ghost Recon Breakpoint came in 2019. It's a great game except it feels repetitive but still fun. I don't know, it feels like Assassins Creed isn't even Assassins Creed anymore. Ghost Recon and Div are barely holding on it seems like. Please listen to your fan base. Whats left of it I guess. Ubisoft is a cornerstone to my gaming childhood. I don't want people to fail or people to lose jobs. But I'm also not gonna support and defend a company that's slowly destroying what I loved. But that's my personal opinion on this.

92,1fxwt4c,oiAmazedYou,1728266267.0,Did anyone here actually like Splinter Cell 1's story?,37,30,"I dont understand why people kept complaining about splinter cell remake changing the splinter cell 1 story...

ill be honest

this story doesnt hold up much at all, but a lot of it is strong (i.e. Nikoladze is a solid villain) the georgian information crisis, the whole oil rig part was kinda interesting and then chinese embassy etc.

i did another replay a month back and thought Chaos Theory had a much better plot than the first.

and i love the first game, i love the missions. it could be my favourite tied with chaos theory. what got me through the first game was its amazing stealth gameplay, the missions, the atmosphere being strong. but a compelling narrative was not there. i didnt really feel that invested in the story. yeah it was nice going into cia or rescuing the abbatoir soldiers or then also sniping nikoladze in the end at presidential palace. presidential palace was amazing. cia hq and presidential are the strongest missions in the game. but the news wires inbetween missions with morris oddell were ok. this could be expanded on alot, add more/new interesting characters, change the story up to a high standard. forget the stealth gameplay for a bit, thats obviously important but splinter cell 1's story needed a lot of work and i am happy ubisoft is changing it. if i could give the original games story a mark id probably say a 6.5/10 at best. the remake has the potential to bring back the old stealth gameplay and also give a compelling narrative an amazing storyline with an interesting plot with the whole nikoladze georgia stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Splintercell/comments/1fxwt4c/did_anyone_here_actually_like_splinter_cell_1s/
93,1fytvun,Nolan_q,1728371147.0,When did Ubisoft fall off a cliff? Or was it a gradual decline?,29,107,"I’ve been a fan of Ubisoft for years, but it’s clear something went very wrong along the way. I’m curious, when exactly did Ubisoft fall off for you? Was it gradual or did they jump the shark at one particular moment?

For me, Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag was their last true high point. The naval combat was fantastic, and it felt like they had so much potential. But look at what they’ve turned out recently. Star Wars Outlaws is embarrassingly mediocre for a franchise with limitless possibilities, and Skull and Bones is just a shadow of what Black Flag achieved years ago. It’s like they completely lost sight of what made their games special.

Maybe it was with Assassin’s Creed Unity and its buggy launch, or was the writing was on the wall with the Watch Dogs series not quite delivering on its promises?

The way I see it, the rot has fully set in at Ubisoft, and honestly, I don’t see them recovering anytime soon. Unless some Elon Musk-type figure steps in, fires the execs and all these managers obsessed with squeezing every last penny out of us with microtransactions, and brings in developers who actually love making games, not just monetising them, it’s hard to see a way out. The culture need to be completely overhauled.

When exactly did their priorities shifted entirely to cranking out cookie-cutter open-world games and pushing live-service models, instead of focusing on creativity and gameplay innovation?

Do they have any chance of turning it around, or are they too far gone at this point? Can Ubisoft can be saved?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fytvun/when_did_ubisoft_fall_off_a_cliff_or_was_it_a/
94,1fxj7n7,ZS1664,1728228880.0,The original Far Cry still holds up pretty well today.,134,76,"You might know Far Cry as the franchise most responsible for making Ubisoft the way it is today.  Assassin's Creed laid the groundwork, but Far Cry 2's large open world built the solid foundation, and you can make a strong argument that Far Cry 3 was the game that firmly codified the Modern Ubi Formula.  But long ago there was a little German developer called Crytek with a big dream.  They wanted to make an engine for a PC game that could let you see as far as they eye could see, and be as lush and beautiful as it was fun to play.  And possibly melt your computer if it wasn't powerful enough.  That's where Far Cry began.  It was a big success - big enough for Ubi to snap up the IP for itself, and certainly successful enough for Crytek to make a spiritual successor, Crysis (which would most certainly melt your computer if it wasn't powerful enough.)

I've been meaning to give it another go, and [this still very in-development mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/far-cry-advanced-version) that adds a bunch of tweaks and modernizations gives me the perfect excuse.  So far it's been really good; that Far Cry mix of stealth and precision attacks still works great even in its infancy and gameplay has been fast and tight.  Yes, I remember what happens in the second half, but hopefully it'll be much more bearable with knowledge and foresight.  I'm impressed that people would actually take the time to polish this old game up and it's still fun as hell.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fxj7n7/the_original_far_cry_still_holds_up_pretty_well/

Not a lot of games in this sale, and you can check the full list to know what's available.

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is at from $79.99 to 54.39 for a limited time.

**Recommendations:**

* **GTA 5 - (67%, $19.79)** - For maybe the 2-3 people that still doesn't own this, now's your chance, as it doesn't get lower than this. Perhaps if GTA 6 is nearing launch maybe it will? But do you want to wait that long?
* **WWE 2K24 (-50%, $59.99)** - This game is free on PS Plus for October. If you aren't a member of PS Plus, then yeah, this is a solid wrestling game which has DLCs on the way.
* **Hogwarts Legacy Digital Deluxe (-70%, $23.99)** - Fun game regardless if you're a Harry Potter fan or not. No co-op or multiplayer of any kind but it lets you live the dream of becoming a mass murdering machine like Voldemort.
* **The Crew Motorfest (-60%, $27.99)** - Still getting support to this day. If you want a more arcade-y racing game.
* **AC Mirage (-50%, $24.99**) - Last year's Assassin's Creed game. Might not have made as big of a thud than Valhalla, but sitting at a generally favorable score at [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/assassins-creed-mirage/).
* **Red Dead Redemption 2 (-70%, $29.99)** - Some might not believe or like it, but this is even better than GTA 5. Fantastic story, engrossing side missions and loads of secrets. You can kill of racist mobs, get anal raped, encounter a vampire and more!
* **Madden 25 (-35%, $64.99)** - Your yearly NFL sim. Can't say if it's good or not since I'm not a football fan but if you're thinking of getting this one, then here you go.
* **Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League (-80%, $19.99)** - Season 3 just launched, but can't really say if this is worth it, since chances are, this will be on PS+ soon?!
* **Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (-55%, $40.49)** - Follow up to the Fallen Order, and better in almost every way. Cal doesn't run around like he has poop in his pants, backtracking issue has been more or less resolved. There's a third one on the way, so if you played the first one, then go pick this one up.
* **Borderlands 3 Next Level Bundle (-90%, $6.99)** - Includes a crapload of DLC and whatnot. Loads of Borderlands stuff are on sale, which fans might wnat to check out. This is well worth the purchase for those looking for some co-op loot action, and there's a free PS5 upgrade available as well.
* **A Way Out (-80%, $5.99)** - Usually on sale alongside It Takes Two, so no rush in getting it. Remember: this is a mandatory co-op game, so if you don't have anyone to play this with, don't bother.
* **Avatar Frontiers of Pandora (-50%, $39.99)** - Ubisoft open word in Avatar! All kidding aside, better than expected. The Gold Edition which includes the DLCs are also on sale.
* **Hi-Fi Rush Deluxe (-40%, $23.99)** - Tango's last game for Microsoft. GOTY contender and generally a different beast than what we usually get. Worth a pick up, but YouTube it first since the aesthetics, etc. might not be a fit for what you're looking for.
* **Midnight Suns (-75%, $19.99)** - Strategy Marvel game. Fun, good length and challenging. Not MCU but proves Marvel franchise can work in almost any genre as long as done right.
* **LEGO Star Wars Skywalker Saga Deluxe Edition (-75%, $17.49)** - Lighthearted Star Wars game you can play with friends or your kids. Familiar LEGO gameplay so expect loads of humor.
* **Mafia 3 Definitive Edition (--75%, $7.49)** - Period GTA but with a better story. There's a new one out next year, so if you want to get on-board this might be the time. Mafia 2 is also on sale for the same price.
* **AC Valhalla (-60%, $15.99)** - Viking Creed! Good action game, but be prepared to sink a lot of time into this.
* **Red Dead Redemption + RDR2 Bundle (-45%, $54.99)** - Not sure about RDR1 performance, but from a gameplay standpoint, should still hold up somewhat.
* **Gotham Knights (-80%, $17.99)** - Support has ended but the game is technically complete. Bat Family are the stars here and you can pull off some insane combos. Might be a bit repetitive, but not a bad game.
* **Back 4 Blood (-90%, $8.99)** - Zombie co-op FPS! Fun with friends. Support has ended, but servers are still up.
* **Alien Isolation The Collection (-85%, $5.99)** - Horror done with the Aliens franchise. Don't expect Resident Evil action, but loads of tense moments. Pick it up if you dig horror games.
* **XCOM 2 Collection (-90%, $9.99)** - Strategy game featuring guns, aliens and did I say strategy?! Not an easy game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fw64n3/psn_store_weekend_offer_sale_for_oct_4_launched/

Regards to recent Unisoft drama and since Skopos came out I have seen many opinions like ""WHAT DOES WHEELCHAIR CRIPPLE DOING IN MILITARY GAME""  or like ""UBISOFT IS DOING WOKE STUFF AGAIN"" and I can't contain the growing rage inside me, this are the dumbest things I have seen in a while. I get the jokes about wheelchair operator and I was confused the same way, this was funny for like a 2 days until we all saw the goddamn robots. Like what is the problem if the only thing you see the goddamn wheelchair is the loading screen. And like what is woke about her? The thing that whe was previously in r6 games? Or the thing that her injury is explained lore-wise ? Or the thing that this operator provides unique ability and diverses gameplay? Of course, injured experienced operator, manipulating robots behind the scenes IS SO WOKE AND UNREALISTIC. This is actually crazy, these people seem to ignore anything about Skopos besides the word wheelchair.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1fw1d2f/skopos_hate_is_actually_crazy/
97,1fwsi8c,Fast-Staff-4416,1728140948.0,Watch_Dogs E3 2012,8,10,"I think there is no one who did not see the Watch Dogs game trailer at E3 in 2012

trailer link: [https://youtu.be/FcMRkyoHKeA?si=1sWaGW8muzPbXS22](https://youtu.be/FcMRkyoHKeA?si=1sWaGW8muzPbXS22)

When I watched the trailer, I couldn't believe what I was seeing in reality, and I was impatiently waiting for the game, and of course, in the end we all know what happened.

Sometimes I would say to myself everything that was shown at E3  
it was just a lie, or just a fake video that was recorded and shown only, and that game does not exist in the first place, but I am wrong. 

You can find another video on the Ubisoft channel

link: [https://youtu.be/7JcujYbctPk?si=DcpSh4NkOz9H2IlM](https://youtu.be/7JcujYbctPk?si=DcpSh4NkOz9H2IlM)

which shows one of the development team trying out the game in front of the audience, and it was very clear that the gameplay was different compared to the other video above.

This means that that copy of the game already exists and is hidden somewhere and no one knows where it is. I'm really sad that we can't get that version, even if we did get that short demo, we might have been able to take advantage of it and integrate it with the original game.

There are some people who tried to work on the game to make it resemble a trailer, but unfortunately, even despite all these efforts, it is very difficult to approach it.

It's been almost 12 years since this happened, and I still go and watch that trailer, which really blows my mind every time, even though it's 2024, but it was really ahead of its time. I'm not saying that the game in the latest version was bad, on the contrary I actually liked it, but if the experience had been as it appeared in the trailer, it would have been the same. It will be completely different.

Unfortunately, we can do nothing but hope that Ubisoft will remake this game for this generation.

Now gameplay-wise, it brings in the best elements of both black flag and AC3 gameplay with some additional mechanics like the assassin's stalker, being boarded from another ship , bounty hunters , the air rifle and the assassination interception missions 

Now, if ubisoft planned this game as a more mainline entry instead of a backup plan for last gen due to AC unity being next gen only and the developers had enough time to give a solid concept of a story enough justice it could have been an easy top 5 entry for me but for what it's worth it's a great farewell from the franchise to the Xbox 360 and ps3 era and I'll definitely take that over some botched last gen version of AC unity like some companies were doing around the time ",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1fvag4q/ac_rogue_is_an_impressive_game/

after trying any possible solution, i contacted Microsoft support and after trying everything again they could not find a solution and sent me give feedback to Microsoft and also open a forum thread to see if anyone else on the internet can help

the problem seems to be caused by the latest windows update (according to some other people on the internet).

trying to uninstall the update did not work for me since the update is refusing to be uninstalled.

also, tried to repair / uninstall easy anticheat

also, tried to log in to a different user / profile

also, tried other game that uses easy anticheat (fall guys (which uses epic games launcher and not Ubisoft)) and got the same error.

also, tried to enable / Disable memory integrity / kernel mode hardware enforced stack protection and the other settings in the cored isolation in windows security settings

also, tried system restore. which failed.

and of course running the game as Admin / verify files

Anyone can help?

1. Get the season pass by purchasing the ubisoft+ membership
2. Just buy the dlc separately

Season pass says that you can play the first episode for free, then again says that i can play the two DLCs out of the total 3 for free (and the dates mentioned in the description are outdated already)...
I am so confused here about it. 

A. Would it only allow me to play a part of the DLC? 

B. Would i have the access to the dlc even if the pass runs out?

C. I don't even know when does their season pass runs out cuz there's no date written anywhere.



Buying the DLCs separately is gonna be costly for me, so that's the least preferred...

I am almost 100% certain that everyone on their team is cheating except for ""Oppz"".

Their usernames are, xim.iso (Gerg), vDisqqq (Raz), itsrenkylo (NotWalling), and pixyyy-\_-. They've been playing for multiple seasons cheating.

UPDATE: I went up against them again and they just straight up admitted to cheating and that Ubi won't do anything about it, that they've been doing it for a service boost for a month.

Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is one of the first games I ever played. It was magical, like a playable Disney movie (back when Disney was good) with engaging action and amazing unforgettable music from Stuart Chatwood.

The first few Splinter Cell games were always captivating to me. I'm stealthy at heart, and the whole secret agent spy theme always appealed greatly to me. Using all the cool gadgets and sneaking past enemies (and shooting when you have to!) was always a blast. There are some elements of the older SC games that haven't aged well at all (needing to stand still for 5 seconds to aim at a light on the ceiling only to miss anyways...) but for their time, they were great games.

And do I even need to bring up Assassin's Creed? I remember being a kid looking at gaming magazines advertising AC2, and ***I remember being hyped about the fact that Ezio could swim.*** Like, that just blew my mind. And actually playing the game was incredible. To this day, AC1 and 2 STILL have the best parkour in the entire series. Wtf, Ubisoft? You already had a high quality parkour system with great skill expression back then. As someone who's been with Ubisoft and Assassin's Creed LITERALLY since the BEGINNING, it has been HEARTBREAKING to see each game after AC2 just slowly killing the parkour system. One by one, slowly, worse and worse. God it's so disgusting.

And, well, I guess that was a rather natural segue into why I'm now *happy* that Ubisoft is going down the drain.

I'm not even going to start about what's stupid about AC Shadows (I don't know where to start. Just yikes all around.) but in general, Ubisoft's monetization has become extremely unfun. Back in the day I actually **didn't really mind** buying a cute cosmetic pack here and there. I liked the flaming horse armor in Origins. But it's a corporate joke that some of the pre-purchase packs for these games are exceeding $100 just to play the game ""early"". That's a lie and a marketing term. You're making people who **purchased your product** play it **later** because they didn't pay as much as you wanted them to. You don't incentivize people to pay more by **locking the game away from them you dolt,** you incentivize people to pay more by **providing them with greater service.**

Seeing the parkour system in AC slowly die, seeing the joke of the way their games are monetized in the last decade, and seeing their narcissistic egos falling apart in their Twitter comments when Elden Ring was new and successful have all contributed to my schadenfreude at Ubisoft's current failing state.

I'm sad, but also happy, because you aren't the Ubisoft I remember. You aren't the same quality studio that made those incredible games. You are incredibly out of touch and I am disappointed in you. I also feel bad because I'm looking forward to the Splinter Cell remake and I want it to be good and successful, but at the same time I want the studio itself to fail because they deserve it. 

Anyway.

Note: No FromSoftware Games discounted, no Stellar Blade. Not a lot of horror games but that should change soon. Halloween PSN sale should launch Oct. 23.

**PSN Deal of the Week:** [**Lies of P (-40$, $41.99)**](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/eff78812-7d8a-4871-935d-71626db857fe/1)

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

* **NBA 2K25 (-30%, $48.99)** – Literally the only basketball game in town. If you like basketball, the NBA, you pretty much only have this as your lone choice. Not a bad entry, but be prepared for gargantuan patches.
* **Madden NFL 25 (-35%, $45.49)** – Same as with the NBA 2K series, this is the only NFL game on consoles.
* **EA Sports MVP Bundle: Madden NFL 25 + College Football 25 (-25%, $112.49)** – Don’t play football games, but based on reviews, College Football is the superior title. If you’re planning on picking both up, this is the first time it’s on sale.
* **Destiny 2: The Final Shape (-40%, $29.99)** – Doesn’t go on sale often. The latest expansion for Destiny 2.
* **GTA 5 (-50%, $19.99)** – PS4 version is $5 less. This is the lowest it’ll go, so if you’re one of the handful that still doesn’t own this, here’s your chance to line Rockstar’s coffers.
* **Hogwarts Legacy (-70%, $20.99)** – PS4 version is a few bucks less, but this is the version to get. At that price, this should be an impulse buy unless you hate wizards, witches or casting spells. Prepare to make a name for yourself as the youngest wizard with the highest killcount in history.
* **Star Wars Jedi Survivor (-60%, $27.99)** – PS4 version surprisingly costs more. This is the version to get. Souls but with a Jedi flavor. Better than the first one in almost every way, and Cal can run properly here. Third game in development, so this is a good time to get into the franchise.
* **It Takes Two (-75%, $9.99)** – Goes on sale almost every other week. Definitely worth it, but just bear in mind you need a co-op partner to play this,
* **Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered (-50%, $24.99)** – Rarely goes on sale, and this isn’t a bad price at all. If you haven’t played this franchise yet, now might be a good start.
* **Cyberpunk 2077 (-40%, $29.99)** – Rocky launch, but now in a stable state. This is what CDPR envisioned for the game. Definitely worth a buy now.
* **Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC (-15%, $25.49)** – Jampacked with content. If you’re done with the main story, then pick this up.
* **Red Dead Redemption 2(-67%, $19.79)** – Even if you’re not a fan of Westerns, this is still a must-play. Amazing story, gameplay and loads of Easter eggs. Actually prefer this over GTA5.
* **Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart (-58%, $29.39)** – Amazing platformer, loads of weapons to use. Has that rift mechanic that’s only possible on PS5. Give this a shot.
* **Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League (-80%, $13.99)** – The lowest I’ve seen this on PSN. Might be heading to PS Plus soon? It’s worth a try at that price, but depends on how much you like these type of games. Just be mindful that support should be ceasing soon.
* *Mortal Kombat 11 (-50%, $24.99)* – Possibly the lowest I’ve seen it on PSN so far. Your dose of violence, and latest Khaos Reigns content drop was just released and brings Animalities.
* **Avatar Frontiers of Pandora (-50%, $34.99)** – Might be the lowest it’s been on PSN without a bundle. Ubisoft’s formula but with an Avatar coating. Better than expected.
* **Still Wakes the Deep (-33%, $23.44)** – Fairly new. Have this but haven’t started yet. Surprised to see it here this fast.
* **Cuphead (-30%, $13.99)** – DLC is also on sale. Gorgeous visuals, tight controls but hard as hell.
* **F1 24 (-50%, $34.99)** – Latest F1 game from Codemasters. If you’re a fan, then this is a good buy.
* **The Last of Us Part 1 Digital Deluxe (-38%, $49.59)** – Just in case you haven’t played this, still a bit high.
* **WWE 2K24 (-50%, $49.99)** – Free this month for PS+, solid wrestling game and still getting DLCs.
* **Skull and Bones (-60%, $27.99)** – Unsure how well this turned out, but apparently there’s enough players to support its seasonal content.
* **Witcher 3 (-75%, $9.99)** – Super low price, and this is one of my all-time fave games. Fantastic side quests, meaty experience all around. Once you get past the floaty controls/combat, and once it clicks, it’s one hell of an experience. Expansion is also on sale and worth the price.
* **Battlefield 2042 (-$85%, $10.49)** – Worth it at that price. Game is in a much better state now than before.
* **AC Valhalla (-75%, $14.99)** – Assassin’s Creed Vikings! Insane amount of content, though overstays its welcome a bit.
* **Borderlands 3 (-90%, $5.99)** – Looter shooter but not live service. Insane action, and a steal at that price.
* **Earth Defense Force 6 (-20%, $47.99)** – If you dig these types of games, might be worth a pickup.
* **The Outlast Trials (-33%, $33.49)** – Multiplayer-focused horror game. Still getting lots of support.
* **GTA The Trilogy (-50%, $29.99)** – Unsure how performance is nowadays. Three games in one in case you want more GTA gaming before GTA6 drops.
* **Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy (-60%, $15.99)** – Crash platforming. Harder than it looks.
* **Mafia Trilogy (-75%, $14.99)** – Three Mafia games in one. Definitely not a bad deal, and there’s a new one on the way.
* **Star Wars Battlefront 2 (-70%, $5.99)** – Definitely worth the price. No content support incoming, but servers still up and someone said here previously that there’s no shortage of players. Fun to smash people around playing as your favorite Star Wars character.
* **LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga (-75%, $14.99)** – Star Wars adventure with Lego humor. Fun to play with kids or your partner.
* **Payday 3 (-60%, $15.99)** – Lowest I’ve seen this on PSN. Not sure if worth it now, but still getting loads of support.
* **Horizon Burning Shores (-50%, $9.99)** – First time I’ve seen this on sale. In case you want more for the game, then this DLC should scratch that itch.
* **Powerwash Simulator (-30%, $17.49)** – Doesn’t go on sale often. Surprisingly fun and getting regular support.
* **Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order (-75%, $9.99)** – If you’re planning on playing the trilogy, then this is your starting point. Lots of backtracking and Cal runs like he has crap in his pants that will never be OK.
* **Dead by Daylight Gold Edition (-40%,$41.99)** – Heavily supported, and DLCs are also on sale. Asymmetrical horror game for those who want something different.
* **Metro Saga Bundle (-85%, $8.99)** – Three games from the Metro franchise at a discounted rate.
* **Far Cry 6 (-75%, $14.99)** – Solid first-person campaign, and stars Giancarlo Esposito as the baddie.
* **Detroit Become Human (-50%, $9.99)** – More of an interactive movie than a game, but still solid. If you haven’t played Quantic’s games, it’s like Supermassive’s titles.
* **Midnight Suns (-75%, $17.49)** – Strategy with Marvel characters. Surprisingly fun even without MCU likenesses, and has solid length and depth.
* **Pacific Drive (-40%, $17.99)** – First-person driving survival game that’s still getting a lot of support.
* **Divinity Original Sin 2 (-65%, $20.99)** – Larian’s breakout hit. If you want your RPGs deep and long.
* **Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition (-20%, $15.99) –** First time this is on sale. If you ever wanted to play the cult classic, then this is the newest way of doing so. You might finish it in time for the sequel which should be coming any day now…
* **Persona 3 Reload Digital Deluxe Edition (-40%, $47.99) –** If you’re looking to play Persona 3, then this is it. Just got it last DLC drop this September as well.
* **System Shock (-40%, $23.99)** – Remake of a classic. SHODAN!
* **For Honor (-85%, $4.49)** – Multiplayer action game but more melee focused. Still getting loads of support after all these years.
* **Flintlock Siege of Dawn (-25%, $29.99)** – AA action game that didn’t sell well. Might be worth a look? Surely will go down in price more in a few months though.
* **Sifu (-60%, $15.99)** – Beat-’em-up but with more modern mechanics. Neat aging system for life, and harder than expected. Fun when you know what you’re doing.
* **Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 Turbocharged (-75%, $12.49)** -Still getting support. If you like your racing games more arcade-y than sim.
* **Hi-Fi Rush (-40%, $17.99)** – Tango’s last game before leaving Microsoft. JP style action-adventure. GOTY contender as well.
* **Mass Effect Legendary Edition (-85%, $8.99)** – Will never not recommend this. Probably my fave RPG trilogy of all-time. You can get your money’s worth with just the first game, but to have your decisions carry over until the last one? Yean, BioWare at their peak!
* **LA Noire (-50%, $19.99)** – Still priced high for an old game. Amazing visuals and makes you feel like a detective.
* **Back 4 Blood (-90%, $5.99)** – Support has ended but still fun if you can round up friends for co-op.
* **Need for Speed Unbound (-85%, $10.49)** – Still getting support somewhat. Arcade racing and has a less serious take on the franchise. Controls feel a bit floaty for me.
* **Banishers Ghosts of New Eden (-30%, $41.99)** – Criminally underrated game. Not AAA, but certain aspects of it do feel AAA. Combat is ists weakest link but it has a lot of content, good story and loads of secrets.
* **Tomb Raider I-III Remastered (-50%, $14.99)** – The old Tomb Raider games but with added sheen. Prepare for pixelated Lara and lots of mindless jumping while shooting.
* **Gotham Knights (-80%, $13.99)** – Underperformed but still fun. At that price, might be worth jumping into it just to test out the combos you can pull off since each character has their own moveset.
* **Lords of the Fallen (-50%, $34.99)** – The reboot. Sequel is in development and the studio pushed out a ton of new features and whatnot.
* **Crash Bandicoot Bundle: N. Sane Trilogy + CTR Nitro-Fueled (-65%, $26.24) –** Crash overload! Platforming and kart racing in a bundle.
* **Titanfall 2 (-75%, $4.99)** – One of the best FPS’ ever made. Play the campaign and jump into the multiplayer to get melted by sweats.
* **Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes (-35%, $32.49)** – Old-school RPG that surprisingly sold and reviewed well. Still getting support and this is the first time it’s on sale on PSN if I’m not mistaken.
* **Shadow of the Tomb Raider (-80%, $3.99)** – Didn’t finish it, but it’s a solid third-person action game. At that price? Yeah, definitely worth a shot.
* **Alone in the Dark (-30%, $41.99)** – Nota successful remake, but not a bad one either. It’s OK. Combat is nothing special and graphics won’t blow anyone away. Ambience is fine, and worth a look for horror fans.
* **A Plague Tale Bundle (-60%, $31.99)** – Don’t play if you get scared of rats, but this is a solid two games and story is well done.
* **Control – (-80%, $7.99)** – Remedy’s pure action game. In the same universe as Alan Wake. This includes the DLCs as well.
* **Hell Let Loose (-40%, $35.99)** – Era multiplayer FPS that’s still getting a lot of support from the devs.
* **The Division 2 Ultimate (-75%, $14.99)** – Fun especially with friends. Includes Warlords of NY expansion. Still getting support and getting new story DLC next year.
* **The Order 1886 (-50%, $9.99)** – Super short but sweet. Loved this when it was released. Amazing visuals then. Shame we won’t see what happens to the tale.
* **Evil West (-60%, $23.99)** – Vampire action game. AA fare but not bad at all. Expect jank and some unpolished visuals but could do worse than this.
* **Cult of the Lamb Cultist Edition (-50%, $14.99)** – Still getting supported. Fun and surprisingly deep. Who knew it was so much fun to have your own cult.
* **Nioh Collection (-58%, $29.39) –** Team Nnja’s Souls game. Hard as nails though, but lots of fans swear how good these games are.
* **Tomb Raider Definitive (-80%, $3.99)** – The first game in the new Tomb Raider trilogy. Solid action games.

110,1fytvun,Nolan_q,1728371147.0,When did Ubisoft fall off a cliff? Or was it a gradual decline?,27,107,"I’ve been a fan of Ubisoft for years, but it’s clear something went very wrong along the way. I’m curious, when exactly did Ubisoft fall off for you? Was it gradual or did they jump the shark at one particular moment?

For me, Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag was their last true high point. The naval combat was fantastic, and it felt like they had so much potential. But look at what they’ve turned out recently. Star Wars Outlaws is embarrassingly mediocre for a franchise with limitless possibilities, and Skull and Bones is just a shadow of what Black Flag achieved years ago. It’s like they completely lost sight of what made their games special.

Maybe it was with Assassin’s Creed Unity and its buggy launch, or was the writing was on the wall with the Watch Dogs series not quite delivering on its promises?

The way I see it, the rot has fully set in at Ubisoft, and honestly, I don’t see them recovering anytime soon. Unless some Elon Musk-type figure steps in, fires the execs and all these managers obsessed with squeezing every last penny out of us with microtransactions, and brings in developers who actually love making games, not just monetising them, it’s hard to see a way out. The culture need to be completely overhauled.

When exactly did their priorities shifted entirely to cranking out cookie-cutter open-world games and pushing live-service models, instead of focusing on creativity and gameplay innovation?

Do they have any chance of turning it around, or are they too far gone at this point? Can Ubisoft can be saved?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fytvun/when_did_ubisoft_fall_off_a_cliff_or_was_it_a/

114,1frjbm5,zaza991988,1727544179.0,Ubisoft make me sad,69,93,"The obligatory thing to say is that I am not a hater, and I own so many Ubisoft games from their major franchise (AC, Ghost Recon, Far Cry, watchdogs, Prince of Persia, The Crew, The Division...)

In the last few years, you have noticed a drop in the gameplay quality of their games. I have a tolerance for long games if they are well-made. I truly enjoyed AC: odyssey and considered it as one of my favorite Ubisoft games (AC: odyssey should have been the start of another separate franchise that focuses more on mythology-based RPG and not an assassin game), i liked Ghost Recon Wildlands and Breakpoint (after the patches). I enjoyed Far Cry 6 and the division series.

Ubisoft art direction and environmental artists are truly some of the best in the industry and capable of releasing amazing-looking games that run well year after year. The cities they create feel very authentic.

Ubisoft also has good gameplay systems, from how the weapons feel and perform, to how the combat flows, to the additional tools they give you to take several scenarios. to usually decent progression system that let you feel more powerful at times goes on

The stories they tell aren't bad, but aren't great either, almost every Ubisoft game follows the same formula, a starting locked-off area that teaches you game mechanics, then three (or more) independent separate areas with separate stories and characters that you can take in any order, and then a final confrontation.

If I have to summarize what makes games turn away from Ubisoft games are constant small frustrations that eventually add up to makes the game feels like a chore to play. Let’s give you some examples.

you can take a look at Far Cry 6 with repeated quest design, and removal of leveling up perks instead of sticking them to clothing pieces each scattered on a different part of the map behind puzzles or enemy camps. Or the not-present main villain, or the fact best gear is hidden behind a paywall.

Almost every Ubisoft game's best weapons and abilities are hidden behind a paywall. Their games are built around frustrating/edging you enough to shell out extra in-game monetization for a game that you already paid for. I am here wondering how much extra money are they making in these MTX console/PC games ? 

Every Ubisoft game must have a merchant that doesn’t take the regular currency, but only takes a premium currency that either has to grind for an unreasonably long time with random weekly reward.

Or selling a complete edition or ultimate edition of the game that doesn’t contain all the content, and you expected to fork extra money on that.

Not to mention the online requirements for single-player games, live services for most Ubi games and finally removing content from your library that you paid for.

All these frustrations add up to gamers automatically feeling like they are about to get screwed because Ubisoft has done so repeatedly in the past.

Some Ubisoft games feel off is that in most cases gameplay systems don't work well together.

In LoZ:Botw almost every upgrade is behind a temple puzzle, but these puzzles are diverse enough with a separate theme that allows challenge your problem-solving skills, different combat skills, timing skills, or creativity and the game gives you all the tools to do that early on.  AC: Valhalla obviously tries to copy the idea of a puzzle behind weapon and upgrade but you end up with a badly designed puzzle that is either not properly introduced, or just looking around to find an opening from an angle to shoot a lock so you can enter a door to shoot another lock to get to a lame rewards (ingots). And the best/coolest rewards (weapons/armors) are hidden behind a paywall. What makes matters worse is that you will spend more time than you like just to find the angle from where you want to shoot because of the game's dense geometry and the art style. Or the never-ending skill tree that is filled with +1% damage while (random action)…. It just feels disrespectful of your time. Even Immortal: fenyx rising suffers from a similar puzzle design but to a slightly lesser degree. These games just feel constantly frustrating you so go and buy ingots from the store using real world money

Or stealth section in star wars outlaws where you don’t have any stealth tools and broken line of sight system.

Or shallow characters and repetitive missions in every Ubisoft game that the writers of the game think they are amazing and cool.

And this makes me sad. Most Ubisoft games aren’t bad, they are a company that targets a 7/10 or 8/10 game that hasn’t released anything a real GOTY in the last decade. It feels like maybe if they spend more time polishing the gameplay systems, better writing,  and better quest design they can end up with solid games every time because you can see the potential. Ubisoft feels like the smart kid in highschool class, who is set to do the bare minimum to get a passing grading that you know can ace the exam if they make the effort, but after a long time doing these, you started wondering if that can even recover because of their bad habits. That is why their games always go on sale soon after launch because no one wants to pay the full price for a game they have played before with a different skin on top, especially when you know another one in releasing in few month that will end up a similar experience. The best way to enjoy a Ubisoft game is to take a long break between their franchise and that what I think instinctively we are doing as gamers.

The game only launches when Ubisoft Connect is offline, which has been made needlessly difficult ever since the redesign. And on Geforce Now (which is one of my most used ways to play games atm) offline mode is impossible to activate, leaving me with almost no option to play the game without inconvenience.

I've been trying to tell Support for a few days now in an ongoing case, but they just keep suggesting steps they've already suggested before, requesting files and data I've already given them or completely missing what the actual issue is. It's as if they can't even be bothered to read any previous messages.

I understand that the game is already over a decade old (God, I feel old), but it's still being sold, so imo they have a responsibility to keep the game working.

So I contacted Ubisoft 4 days ago because when I tried to launch my game library through GFN(GeForce Now) I got a Ubisoft connect DRM authentication error. It took them 56 hours to initially respond, then they bounced through 25 different agents in 9 hours, MADE ME MAKE A NEW EMAIL ACCOUNT, A NEW UBISOFT CONNECT ACOUNT, AUTHENTICATED ONLY ONE OF 6 GAMES I REQUESTED AFTER ASKING FOR THE EXACT SAME PROOF OF PURCHASE PHOTO 9 TIMES(which wasn’t even for the original game I asked for), SEPARATED MY GAME LIBRARY BETWEEN TWO ACCOUNTS, THEN SUPPORT DELETED THE BRAND NEW ACOUNT THEY FORCED ME TO MAKE. 

After all of that they still  failed to resolve issue, and then  they stonewalled me because I suggested at this point I’d probably just end up making a complaint with the FTC(an excellent resource if you have transactional issues with businesses), that I’d possibly speak with someone about getting refunds for my entire catalog through the respective markets, and speak to someone in the Ubisoft legal department, because I’ve spent a considerable amount on my Ubisoft Catalog, and they’ve wasted a lot of my time. Now none of my games work, including newer purchases for the ghost series which were made directly through the Ubisoft connect account I merged with when uplay shut down. 

Oh yeah, did I forget to mention I already dealt with this when Uplay first shut down? Yeah this is round 2 of this service inexplicably messing up. And even more confusingly, all of my games are shown as owned under my main account, including keys, and I played them all only a few months ago the last time I was subscribed to GFN. 

After this 5 day ordeal, I only have thing to say. 
Dear Ubisoft, from the absolute bottom of my heart, you destroyed my love for your games this weekend, and even worse you soured all the nostalgia I used to have.

121,1fdkrpz,brodiebradley51,1725982392.0,[CONFIRMED] Siege is sticking with the 2 operator per year format (which sucks!),1405,261,"Justin, who is one of the lead operator designers, revealed that there has been a definitive change to the release schedule of operators down to 2 a year.

This started in Year 9 (which we are currently in) and unfortunately seems to be maintained into the future. I’m guessing the other two seasons will either come with a new map or an operator rework.

Either way, this is damning news. We have such little content entering the game now that the operator was the saving grace. Now we will get season inevitably with very minimal content that will hurt the game long-term just like New Blood did (which the dev team themselves apologised for in the Twin Shells reveal).

We are essentially guaranteed 2 seasons per year with little to no interesting or engaging content for the masses. New characters will ALWAYS be the biggest attraction for new and existing players so limiting this is absolutely insane.

Considering Siege is Ubisofts big live-service money maker and nothing is on the horizon to dethrone this, they should be pumping more resources into the game to keep it fresh and engaging thus keeping players happy and wanting to spend money.

Having 2 ops a year will be the thing that hurts the game the most. They will never get on top of the cheating problem and now we have literally no substantial content to keep existing players engaged enough for 2-3 months per these dry, content-lacking seasons.

122,1fenftm,RedditIsDyingYouKnow,1726094748.0,Siege has the most negative Community,8,21,"Is there anything in particular that makes this games community whine so much? I’ve been using this sub for a couple months now and it seems to thrive entirely on the negativity. I understand that Siege is facing some serious problems at the moment, but frankly it’s getting ridiculous.

Maybe it’s a mix of Siege being a game of ego and general dissatisfaction with the way the game is going, and there’s a ton of valid criticisms to be made of Ubisoft (Anti-Cheat, Gamebreaking bugs (clash esports lol), lack of content, etc

However it seems like Siege’s Community is incapable of being happy with changes of any kind. It must not be easy being a Ubi Dev since no matter what you do, someone is going to want to yell at you. There’s no winning.

Even when Siege’s balancing is the most solid it’s been in a long time, that’s still not enough. Even when for the last year every operator (bar the recruits) have revolutionized their respective teams. Brava is amazing, Fenrir is such a cool operator although he was overpowered. Azami has to be the most interesting and dynamic character ever added to the game, Ram is a one woman army, Deimos released balanced and he’s the perfect roam clear we’ve been needing.

They got rid of the 1.5x meta and practically nobody talked about it despite the community praying for it for 2 years. I can’t be the only one that thinks the direction the game is heading in is fine. (Woahhhh the game that’s nearly a decade old is not getting as much content as compared to the first year of its live service launch model!!! Who could have guessed???)

No but seriously, people complain about the lack of content but then they get mad anytime anything is changed in the game. It’s not possible to do both. As new things get added to the game the balancing needs to be, well, balanced.

I’ll say it, Siege now is significantly better as a game compared to any of the first 6 years. I know this is an unpopular opinion and I accept that but that’s what I truly believe. I love current Siege, I love how the mix of aggressive plays and utility usage allows both types of players (the slow and the fast) to have a role. I love how the game has been slowed down but not enough to the point that every round is spent clearing utility and waiting until the last 30 seconds to flood site.

This post has been a little bit jumbled, but I think it could start a conversation. Why are Siege players so resistant to change? Is it Nostalgia? For those of you that believe the game is worse now compared to the past I don’t want to just agree to disagree I want to hear from you why you think that if you don’t mind sharing.

So I recently came back to playing PC which I was unable to do for the last 6 months and now I wanted to play Frontiers of Pandora. So far so good. Had to reset passwords cause I forgot my previous one and wrote the new one down and told the Pc to remember my login. 

Did update the game afterwards.

Came to start FOP…. And it crashes. Cloud Sever can’t be synchronized and when I tried skipping that step it didn’t work. Try it again 20 times and it keeps crashing. At this point I’m annoyed. So I checked the installed game data for errors. When that was done, I launched it again. And it crashed …. Because after I started it an add window for the new Assassin‘s Creed game that’s gonna be released in November pops open. I try it again. Same thing happens. I try it another 20 times, disconnect and reconnect from the internet, use a differ WiFi source etc. Any attempt to play offline fails. I am foaming from my mouth. After half an hour the game starts. I play it just fine.

Next day, same shit happens. The program keeps saying that it can’t update cloud data which is weird because I have a stable internet connection. Anyway, after another half an hour of restarting my pc, the internet, uplay and whatever gods approval I need for a bloody game to launch. It does. I play in piece. 

Today, I was logged out of my Ubisoft account. I put in my email and password; it doesn’t start. I put it in another few times, it doesn’t start. I check if I have the right password, which I have because I wrote it down when I resettled it. I can’t login to my account because of a connection error, which again is weird because I have stable WiFi. 

I try to reset my password again. Get the email, reset it, generate a new password and copy it via shortcut…. Or. So. I. Thought. It didn’t copy. I try resetting again. The box that I have to check to verify I am not a robot and therefore attempt to resent my password is now loading for half an hour. I get that this one is on me and my stupidity but the constant crashing has ticked me off a few too many times the past days.

What do I do? I cannot log into my account at the moment, I cannot reset my password at the moment, Ubisoft has no service hotline. What do I do? Help? Do I just wait? Do I complain? If yes, where?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1f0x57i/game_launch_crashes_and_resetting_passwords_is_a/

142,1enr9cl,Jolly-Chemistry-7764,1723179520.0,Many issues with Ranked 2.0 (Ranked 2.0 Rant + New Ranked System Idea!),2,11,"I wanna start by stating that I understand this isn't really the best place to talk about this and it's probably just another Ranked 2.0 rant about how much I hate the new system but I will be talking about a new look at the Ranked system if you stick around long enough for that (Or if your mind doesn't explode from all the reading). If you wanna downvote this or just completely moderate and erase it, that's fine by me I guess.

But for those who do want to read through this hell-scape of a mini hate essay, here it is. 

There is obviously a major issue going on with Ranked 2.0. Thoroughly combing through R6Fix reports, I managed to find more than 10 issues related to unfair matchmaking and took screenshots of them all after I abandoned a game with a 9% chance of winning, they were all the same. Silvers getting matched against Emeralds and Diamonds. All of these reports were archived rather quickly and I expect the one that I made on R6Fix to be archived as well, under the tag, ""Not a bug"".

These issues have to be bugs, there is no other title that seems adequate for them and since Ubisoft would rather shutter these issues instead of confront them, the future is not looking so bright for the upcoming years of R6 Ranked. There is no good way to cut the matchmaking system, it will always be unfair to a number of people, no matter how small that number may be. I'll try to put this in perspective for you.



\[You're a Gold III, you just entered a game after sitting in the main menu and requeuing every 30 seconds for fair matchmaking pools. You check your teammates stats and ranks. They are all decent, fair ranking team members who actually seem to know what they are doing. You look and you see that 2 of your teammates are Emeralds...This is strange, because you should be playing in Gold lobbies.\]



\[You don't mind the Emeralds, you let them do their own thing. Action Phase starts, you get into a couple of outgoing gunfights but eventually, you get your head beamed off your shoulders. You look at the kill-cam and you see that the enemy has a Diamond card background for Deadly Omen. ""Huh? Why am I facing Diamonds?"" You say to yourself, you hop on cams only to find that the basement one is the only cam that is still alive so its useless.\]



\[Your gold teammates get absolutely mowed down by the Diamond player who is better than everyone in the lobby except his Emerald teammate, it all comes down to the Emeralds. 2 v 1. The Emeralds lose braincells mid-game and now they start throwing, you lose the match unfortunately and then you see that you have a 9% chance of winning the game and using this information, you summon all your strength not to yell and curse at the incompetent Emeralds who had the advantage and still lost. You also use this strength to completely abandon the match and shut off your PC.\] 

(That was just an example, totally not true.)

Now, using that example, try to imagine that happening to you, every 3 in 5 games. This can't be a regular thing with Ranked 2.0, this has to be some sort of bug or glitch, right? Well, hidden MMR is a thing but, you'd think, if you had the hidden MMR of a Diamond, wouldn't you be in Diamond? Or have better RP gain? Something isn't right. I'm a Gold III, I used to be a casual player but now I wanted to become a little more competitive (To impress people, usually friends but, I have none of those.) Why am I getting matched with people between Platinum and Diamond? My hidden MMR can't be THAT high or else I'd be really good.

I'm not talking about current Diamonds or Plats or Emeralds. I'm talking about people who got really high rankings in the past seasons but in the current season, they are gold. All of the sudden I'm getting ranked with them for a reason I don't fully understand or understand at all actually.

If this is ""Skill-Based Matchmaking"", what is measured as skill? K/D? If it's K/D then that is a very poor and inaccurate measurement, the reason I have a 1.3 K/D is because I am good at gunfights when the opponent is the same skill level as me. I can kill golds, not sweaty Diamonds who are hyped up on Adderall and Black Ice GFuel.

I recently made a new account, just to test what the system does to a new player, I entered Standard and got a lucky ace while screwing around with the M870 on Sentry. The next match. Chaos. It was hell. Instantly matched up against sweaty Platinums who think they get something after completely destroying everyone in a Standard match. Mind you, quick match requires level 10 to even enter. So, if you're a new player and you have some sort of semblance of what is going on and you get a high K/D on your first match in Standard, you will get punished for that. The system doesn't care if it's luck, skill, or pure coincidence. It WILL drag you into high rank lobbies, there is no escaping it. You're next.



# New Ranked System Idea!

Onto the important part or maybe the part that will save this entire post from being completely deleted when a moderator comes and smacks down the hammer.

Now, it is probably unpolished and completely built upon my anger for this so called, ""Matchmaking system"". I'll try my best to explain this in a coherent form.

Ubisoft's R6S R&D Team has access to Tracker Network, or better known as R6 Tracker. They have the raw player data at headquarters but I don't think they are fully using it or, at the very least, using it correctly. A new season is here, everyone is unranked or copper. Take all of the people who were previously highly ranked or whatever ranks they were in the previous season and put them up against people who were the same ranking AND Hidden MMR Rating as them. All is fair. Sunshine and rainbows. (Cupcakes too, if you like them

However, some issues pop up here...What about the people who didn't play for a while and they are just now returning? No system is perfect. But with this system, at least you can rank back up or shake that rust off and get back into Ranked without having to face unbearably unfair odds. Take a rusty player and put them in Ranked 2.0? They will take their leave for good, because in Ranked 2.0, it's either you're good from the start or you will remain hardstuck and being hardstuck is a pain that all of us, even veteran players, have felt once in their R6 career.

In conclusion, while this post might still be deleted for how long it is, I just wanted to post this so it could go out to people, maybe some of you can relate to some of the issues I mentioned or hinted at? I hope so. Feel free to comment or something. This is like, my first time posting on Reddit so this whole post might be completely trash since I don't know if there are any unwritten rules for posting. (What the hell is Markdown?).

Oh! And a message to Ubisoft developers, if you see this...If you want to keep a fanbase alive over the many years that R6 will be out, don't waste your time trying to drown everyone in overpriced cosmetics and a skin gambling service (R6 Marketplace), we saw what you did with your subscription membership, that was greedy and uncalled for. Such a waste of time. We know that you guys have much on your plate for upcoming seasons, like a better Anti-Cheat (Thank God!) but consider putting more time into actually fixing your ranking system and explaining what the hell Hidden MMR is. (If it isn't so important anymore, why keep it hidden? Seems fishy.)

147,1ehoozv,LunaFudge,1722538657.0,Reimagining the mainline Assassin's Creed games (some spoilers),14,9,"I’ve been thinking on how, over the years, the *Assassin’s Creed* mainline series has become slightly disorganized.

While the games are still individually entertaining, there is less cohesion across the franchise, and the recent RPG-style games have moved away from the traditional assassin-focused gameplay suggested in the series title.

Below are my recent thoughts on how I’d reimagine the franchise. This what I’d do if I had the ability to retrospectively make changes which would provide better cohesion for the whole series, and which I think provide more flexibility and scope with future installments.

**Disclaimer**: I haven’t played / read / watched all *Assassin’s Creed* content. There are most likely gaps in my knowledge that would impact the below.

**Disclaimer**: This is just for the mainline games, not the mobile games, books, comics, upcoming TV series, etc.

—

# New additions to the franchise

—

**Assassin’s Creed Outlaws**

Historical setting:

* England, 12th c.

Plot synopsis:

* The protagonist is the person on whom Robin Hood stories are based.
* It makes sense — hooded character, shrouded in legend, combat expert, served the common people, fought tyranny.
* This is an origin-story arc following a charitable bowman who is recruited into the Brotherhood. Instilled by a purpose of 'helping his people', he becomes a bowman in the army. But then he discovers the corruption and cruelty, pushing him toward the Brotherhood.
* Some retellings of Robin Hood depict him as having fought in the Crusades. This could overlap with the plot of *Assassin’s Creed* (2009), tying the story in with Altair’s story and showing how the Creed was brought (or re-introduced, considering *Valhalla*) to England through a single, linear mission set in the Holy Land.
* The protagonist's hideout is Sherwood Forest, serving as a base of operations where you can upgrade your equipment and plan missions.
* The protagonist must navigate the political intrigue and power struggles of the time, forging alliances and making enemies along the way.

Gameplay:

* The gameplay has all the expected mechanics of an *Assassin's Creed* mainline game — one-hit assassinations, stealth, social stealth, parkour. However, the game would have much deeper ranged combat mechanics, e.g. different ranged combat styles, a wider array of types of bow and ranged weapons, different types of arrows (a depth of ranged combat similar to the *Horizon* games).
* You build a band of 'Merry Men' during the story. You can, for example, use these characters in black box missions to help you distract guards or find access routes (e.g. Maid Marian causing a distraction; Little John brawling with guards; Friar Tuck giving you disguises or information to access fortifications).
* Leaning into the ‘Robin Hood’ reputation: You can pickpocket people, but only wealthy people. You have to identify them by their clothes, where they’re located, eavesdropping on their conversations, etc. You can gain favour by redistributing accumulated wealth to the common people. This can create more social stealth opportunities, get supplies or services for cheaper, open new infiltration or escape routes (e.g. guards who’ll give you access, being able to hide or escape through the back of taverns, etc.)

Map:

* This game would be set in a large map of England, centrally focused on Nottingham (*Valhalla*’s map would be slightly different, see below).

—

**Assassin’s Creed Origins**

2017’s *Origins* would be given a different name, see further below.

Historical Setting:

* Rome, 44BC and 96AD

This a different story about the origin of the Assassin Brotherhood (hence the renaming of 2017’s *Origins*).

* *Assassin’s Creed Origins* (2017) still exists in-universe, but is given a different name and the Hidden Ones do not originate in that story. There is >!no epilogue showing how Aya and Bayek founded the the Hidden Ones (see further below)!<.

The prologue follows the assassination of Julius Caesar.

* This is one of the most famous assassinations in history. It’s fitting that it would be the inception of the Assassin Brotherhood (as opposed to >!an epilogue event in 2017’s *Origins*!<).
* Caesar represented order, security, prosperity, but was a dictator. Those who assassinated him were motivated (in part) by maintaining democracy and the freedom the Republic.
* *Assassin’s Creed* is the story of ‘Assassins versus Templars’ as and allegory for ‘freedom and liberty’ versus ‘order and security’. It’s a philosophical war waged violently and secretly. It would be more suitable that these philosophical motivations were the origins of the Brotherhood. In 2017’s *Origins*, Bayek and Aya were principally seeking to >!avenge their son!<. By contrast, in this retelling, the prologue’s protagonist is principally acting to prevent ‘order and security’ through dictatorship, represented by Caesar, in the name of freedom.
* The most apt figure to play as in the prologue is Brutus. Aya / Bayek could make a cameo appearance, but the player gets a better sense of the motivations for the assassination of Caesar when playing as one of the assassins who murdered him in the name of democracy. Playing as Brutus also connects to Brutus’ appearance in the Ezio trilogy.

The main storyline takes place in 96AD.

* At this point, Rome was under the rule of a “despotic” emperor, Domitian. The plot culminates in the assassination of Domitian (a historical event), so that power could transfer to Nerva (regarded as a “good” Roman ruler who vowed to restore personal liberties).
* The playable protagonist is a descendant of Brutus (or whoever the playable prologue protagonist is). Messages and information have been left by the prologue for the main-game protagonist. The main-game protagonist tries to continue the legacy. Over the course of the game, they recruit allies and formalise their work into a ‘brotherhood’.
* Aware that the assassination of Caesar did not return Rome to a republic, the group establish ‘parameters’ for their work (a ‘creed’) in the hopes that these parameters will make sure their work is not unchecked. This causes tension with some members of the group during the course of the story, but it ultimately proven worthwhile.
* Because the game is set 96AD, the Colloseum is a playable location. To get close to Domitian to assassinate him, the protagonist disguises themselves as a gladiator and gains an audience with the Emperor after winning a series of fights, i.e. there are a several gladiatorial boss battles preceding the final assassination.
* Because the setting is Italy, there can be many easter eggs referencing the Ezio trilogy.

A DLC could follow how the Templars latched onto early Christianity as a vessel for spreading their power across Europe and the globe.

* The origin of the Templars’ influence in Christianity being revealed in letters in a non-main mission in *Valhalla* was underwhelming.

**Assassin's Creed Rogue**

This is a different version of the idea behind 2014's Rogue. So, I guess, Rogue (2014) wouldn’t exist in this reimagined universe (though I do love the game).

Historical setting:

* Europe, 1914 – 1918 (WW1 generally)

Plot synopsis:

* The same story beats happen like in Rogue (2014) — you begin as a novice Assassin, become disillusioned with the Brotherhood, turn to the Templar Order, and begin to hunt down other Assassins.
* The protagonist is a novice Assassin. They are part of a group that infiltrate the Black Hand. They collude to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand, aware that he is part of / influenced by the Templar Order and has pledged to commit some sort of crack-down or use some Isu device on their behalf once in power.
* The assassination goes awry, the Duchess is also killed, and the protagonist witnesses the fallout of this assassination leading to the death and destruction of WW1.
* The protagonist begins to believe the Assassins’ modus operandi is reckless and unchecked, despite the ‘creed’, and that the Brotherhood does not act with enough forethought to be able to prevent fallouts like WW1 resulting from their actions.
* The protagonist becomes disillusioned with the Brotherhood as a results, and begins to believe that the ‘order and security’ proposed by the Templars could have prevented WW1.
* The protagonist tracks down and kills Brotherhood leaders in Europe over the course of the game. This could culminate with a show-down in London against Lydia Frye (or a cameo from Evie Frye).

Why is this a better storyline than Rogue (2014)?

* This plot provides a more direct cause and effect between the philosophy and modus operandi of the Brotherhood and the fallout that pushes your character out of the Brotherhood and toward the Templars.
* Shay turned to the Templars after becoming disillusioned with the Brotherhood's handling of Precursor artifacts. He believed that disturbing these artifacts caused earthquakes, a view that put him at odds with the Brotherhood's leadership due to their recklessness and disregard for the consequences of disturbing Precursor artefacts. His disagreement was with the leaders' approach, not the core tenets of the Brotherhood itself — suggesting that a change in leadership could resolve the issue, rather than a full dissolution of the Brotherhood. However, in this new version of Rogue, the protagonist’s disagreement is with the act of assassinating key figures and the consequences therefrom, which is the Brotherhood’s core method and namesake. In this way, the protagonist has a stronger reason to seek the destruction of the whole Assassin Brotherhood.
* Rogue (2014)’s events may have given Shay motivation to leave the Brotherhood, but that doesn’t consequently mean he would have joined the Templars, too. His motivation for leaving the Brotherhood didn’t give him a strong reason to join the Templars (who were also seeking to disturb Precursor artefacts). In this reimagining of Rogue, the protagonist leaves the Brotherhood and is drawn to the Templars in the hope that the ‘order and security’ they’re preaching could prevent such cataclysmic wars.
* Precursor artefacts appear in many other games and don’t appear to cause such sizeable earthquakes when disturbed in those games, so there’s a slight continuity error in the series from Rogue (2014).
* This would be the closest a historical setting in a mainline game has been to the modern-day story (bar the WW2 missions in Unity). This game ends with the protagonist having killed a lot of the Brotherhood leadership. This helps explain why, in the modern-day storyline, the Brotherhood seems much smaller than it had been in other periods in history.

Map:

* The map is set across key locations in Europe during WW1.
* As the story progresses, there are time jumps, and as a result the status of the War changes. Parts of the map open up / become easier to explore as the nations win and lose battles.
* Your character is agnostic on the sides of the war effort, intent primarily on taking down the Assassins. Therefore, you can build alliances with different Powers or disguise yourself in order to open up new 'fronts' on the map.

Gameplay:

* Using disguises to access Map areas or buildings requires learning knowledge. You can wear a uniform to disguise yourself, but must also be prepared to answer questions based on information you might have learned elsewhere. For example, when you disguise yourself in uniform to infiltrate a military camp and you are spotted, you have an opportunity to answer a security question — but the correct answer to security question is gleaned from investigating information and clues in other parts of the map.
* Different fronts, battles, etc. provides an opportunity to bring back the conquest battle dynamic from Odyssey.

# An 'Assassin’s Creed Legends' series

—

This is a reimagined title series for mainline *Assassin’s Creed* games that do not fit into the traditional, assassin-focused, historically-accurate formula.

In other words, the RPG-type games would be ‘Assassin’s Creed Legends’ titles (*Origins* (2017), *Odyssey*, *Valhalla*) as well as any other *Assassin's Creed* game that experiments with the formula and realism (e.g. *Assassin’s Creed Hexe*, based on rumours). So, *Assassin’s Creed Valhalla* would be *Assassin’s Creed Legends: Valhalla*.

One of the key differences is that the modern-day story follows the activities of an Assassins’ Bureau historian. This character (which could be Layla) is piecing together the stories of allies of / inspirational figures for the Brotherhood through manuscripts, letters, tomes, diaries, etc. in an attempt to uncover clues about the Isu, the Templars, or whatever the through-line plot is.

Bayek, Kassandra/Alexios, and Eivor were not, foremost, Assassins in these games. Bayek was a Medjay, Kassandra/Alexios was a mercenary, Eivor was a Viking. >!None became ‘Assassins’ in the main game storyline!<. By reframing these games as retellings of the stories of people that were allies of / inspiration to the Brotherhood, and setting them under a different but related title, it gives Ubisoft a stronger licence to tell the story of non-Assassin protagonists in the *Assassin’s Creed* universe.

Most importantly, these stories are presented to the player as semi-factual legends within the game world rather than literal events.

Why would this set-up be more suitable for these games in the overarching *Assassin’s Creed* story?

Incorporating fantastical and mythological elements:

* The RPG games include much more fantastical elements, like undead pharaohs in *Origins* (2017), minotaurs and cyclops in *Odyssey,* and witches in *Valhalla.* The protagonists’ abilities are also more exaggerated to the point of being superhuman-like.
* This reimaging more elegantly explains the incorporation of fantastical, non-realistic elements. In this ‘Assassin’s Creed Legends’ reimagining, the source material is written accounts (manuscripts, diaries, etc.) rather than memories in the Animus, so the accounts of Bayek, Kassandra/Alexios and Eivor are coloured and exaggerated by the way the chronicler has recorded them.
* For chroniclers at these times, what we’d consider to be mythological were probably believed to be factual. So, from the perspective of the writer who recorded these protagonists’ stories, they were giving an accurate account.
* Rumours are that *Hexe* will be a “very different” type of *Assassin’s Creed* game, and that it >!will involve magical elements!<. I think this is another game that would be more suited to the ‘Assassin’s Creed Legends’ title for this reason.

Incorporating mythological DLC:

* *Origins* (2017), *Odyssey* and *Valhalla* had DLC based in mythological realms. However, in each game they function differently: in *Origins*, the Pieces of Eden ‘transport’ Bayek there; in *Odyssey*, the realms are ‘simulations’; in *Valhalla*, having taking hallucinogens, Eivor experiences ‘memories’ of these realms in which they look like Norse mythology. Instead, ‘Assassin’s Creed Legends’ would introduce DLC as newly-discovered manuscripts, chronicles, etc. retelling the protagonists’ adventures in mythical realms, conflating fact and fiction the way many ancient historians did. They could be presented as an epic semi-fictitious retelling (e.g. *The Iliad*). The modern-day protagonist is attempting to extract the fact from the fiction.
* This set-up can be used across the ‘Assassin's Creed Legends’ series, and even explains why DLC occurs later than the main storyline — because these stories were discovered or studied later.
* Some of the DLC are currently presented in these games as Animus memories, or memories within memories (e.g. *Valhalla*’s *Dawn of Ragnarok*). These are first-hand accounts. However, a second-hand account of these stories allows for a greater suspension of belief in the events that occurred.

Retelling the Isu story through the account of a chronicler:

* Because chroniclers at these times had mythology and religion as their frame of reference for most things, it also better explains why Isu stories from these games are presented to look like Norse, Greek or Egyptian mythology.
* For example, the Isu event of >!Loki betraying Odin!< retold in *Valhall*a would be presented in a classic Norse environment because that’s how the story was best explained to audiences and has been orally adapted over the years before it was transcribed into a manuscript (as opposed to just being conflated with Eivor's religious beliefs).

# Overall changes across the franchise

—

I think the overarching changes below would have improved the story and helped with overall cohesion in the series.

Remove the male/female protagonist choice.

* Choosing between Alexios or Kassandra, or male or female Eivor didn’t add to the story. And one of each of these had to end up being canon, anyway. So, they should have just gone with whichever makes the most sense for the plot and for the historical setting.

Remove most of the dialogue choices.

* The dialogue choices in the RPG games are mostly inconsequential. Instead, they undermine character development. For example, choosing the aggressive response in one dialogue choice and then the rationale response in the next detracts from developing the protagonist's own persona. Let the writers write compelling stories / characters.

The Templars have always been called the Templars.

* The name may have modified over the millennia (e.g. “Temple Order”, “Order of the Temple”), but the organization should be the same.
* Preceding organizations (Order of the Ancients, Cult of Cosmos) are generally unnecessary when they serve the same purposes as an antagonist of the Assassin Brotherhood. While the ‘Templar’ name is tied to the Crusades, I don't think there's a reason why it couldn't have existed in periods preceding the game. The name change felt unnecessary. >!That the “Templars” were founded after King Alfred destroyed the Order of the Ancients was revealed mostly in letters in a non-story mission was anticlimactic.!<

Similarly, the Assassin Brotherhood has always been called the Assassin Brotherhood

* The difference in name between ‘Hidden Ones’ and ‘Assassins’ was unnecessary when the operations and objectives were/are the same. Instead, from its origin, the Brotherhood should always have called itself the Assassin Brotherhood.

Remove the enumeration on the early games and give each game a subtitle.

* See changes to specific games in the series, below.

Reduce the amount of Isu content

* The ‘mystery box’ appeal of the Isu lore has waned with so many reveals over the course of the games.
* It feels like there are too many storylines that culminate in a fight over an Isu McGuffin in an underground Isu temple.
* The significance of Isu artefacts is lost when there are so many artefacts, Isu weapons and temples littered throughout the games.
* It’s harder and harder to suspend belief that the rest of society did not / does not know about the Isu when there are so many artefacts, machines and temples around the world.
* The end-of-the-world stakes in the early games was probably premature, it makes it harder to build stakes in the more recent games after that.
* I personally find the philosophical and literal war between Assassins and Templars more compelling than the Isu stuff.

# Changes to specific mainline titles

—

***Assassin’s Creed Valhalla***

Reimaging this game, there would be greater emphasis on Viking naval exploration.

* The base-game map would consist of Norway, England, Ireland, France, and another region (Denmark, Iceland, etc.). The ‘England’ region would be much smaller and more densely populated than in the 2020 game.
* Each of these regions in the base game would have more diverse regional enemy archetypes you encounter. This adds more variety for the long period spent exploring and navigating in this game.
* Splitting the base-game map between these several regions encourages the player to use their ship (which wasn’t a particularly useful mode of transport in the original) and it leans into the Viking fantasy of longship exploration.
* The map would be presented visually as a map of Northern Europe from the Viking perspective, created by cartographers at the time.
* You can travel between regions by sailing in that direction off-map (e.g. *Black Flag*, *Rogue*) or zooming into that region on the map to get the more detailed view (similar to how the world map functions in *Witcher 3*).
* This also helps explain why distances and land masses are skewed in the game — because they’re skewed on the map and in this Viking retelling.

You wouldn’t create just one ‘settlement’.

* Norway would serve as the ‘base’ of operations, but you set up ‘outposts’ in the different regions (England, Ireland, France, etc.). There is less emphasis on settlement building and more emphasis on nomadic exploration.

Looting and jomsvikings would serve a deeper function in the game.

* Leveling-up would not be a solo endeavor based on gaining XP through story and side missions. It’d also involve accumulating resources through raids, recruiting and developing jomsviking and building out the settlements.
* Similar to how you can have different ‘builds’ for the protagonist based on different objectives, you can create different ‘builds’ for your jomsviking that are more or less helpful depending on the archetypes of different regions in the game.

Vinnland would be a DLC.

* Instead of being a small region in the base game, Vinnland would be a much larger region introduced as DLC.
* It seemed jarring in 2020’s *Valhalla* that you could jump back and forth from North America like it wasn’t a huge distance and effort for a Viking longship. It was also odd that you would visit this region before Ireland or France, which are far closer to Ravensthorpe.
* Instead, I think this arc should be presented as an epilogue for Eivor. Considering that >!she is buried in North America!<, it would be befitting that this arc is a farewell to Ravensthorpe and explains how and why she settled in North America. It’s not unprecedented that and *Assassin’s Creed* DLC tells a story set a few years into the future, e.g. *Assassin’s Creed Syndicate: Jack the Ripper* DLC.
* You would be able to jump back-and-forth between Vinnland and the base-game map, but you’re jumping between different ‘manuscripts’ telling stories of Eivor at different periods in her life.

You can kill the monks.

* This *Valhalla* would bring back the ‘wanted’ / bounty system from *Odyssey,* with the zealots. Killing monks would increase the wanted meter faster, but it’s not a Viking fantasy if you’re ‘game over’ whenever you intentionally / accidentally kill a monk.

It would be called ‘Assassin’s Creed Legends: Valhalla’ (see above).

—

***Assassin’s Creed Syndicate***

Evie would be the sole playable protagonist.

* She acts and operates like a more traditional Assassin. Her objectives are more in-line with the Creed.
* By the time *Syndicate* was released, *Assassin’s Creed* was overdue a female-protagonist game.
* Splitting the story between two characters undermines the character-building for both characters, and they end up one-dimensional.
* Jacob’s actions in the story are more a hinderance than a help to their overall objectives.
* The story would focus even more on the socio-political issues of the time, such as child labor, poverty, and the stark class divides, making it a more grounded and realistic narrative.

The tone would be much darker:

* The historical setting of Victoria London should be dark and gritty. It was a grim time for many people, and it was literally dark and gritty from the Industrial Revolution pollution.
* Jacob’s light-heartedness jars with what should be a grim backdrop. This is another reason why Evie should be the sole protagonist.

Essentially, the changes they made for the *Jack the Ripper* DLC should be applied to the whole game.

—

***Assassin’s Creed II***

Rename to “*Assassin’s Creed Dynasty*”

* Reflects the mantle of Assassin being passed down through the Auditore family.
* Reflects the dynastic powers at the time — the Borggia, the Medici.

—

***Assassin’s Creed III***

Rename to “*Assassin’s Creed Revolution*”.

* Reflects the American Revolution setting.
* Reflects Connor revolting against >!his father’s legacy as a Templar!<.
* Disadvantage is that it sounds a lot like the preceding title, *Revelations*.

—

***Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag***

* Just name it *Assassin’s Creed Black Flag.*
* Otherwise perfect, no notes.

—

***Assassin’s Creed Unity***

Rename to 'Assassin’s Creed Liberty'.

* ‘Unity’ only made sense in relation to the multiplayer, not in relation to the game’s storyline.
* ‘Liberty’ reflects the values of the Creed, and reflects the “liberté, égalité, fraternité” French motto.
* Disadvantage is that it sounds like *Assassin's Creed Liberation*.
* ‘Fraternity’ would have been a good alternative to be able to reflect the Brotherhood and the multiplayer aspect of the game as well as “liberté, égalité, fraternité”, but it probably has too many connotations relating to college fraternities.

—

***Assassin’s Creed*** ***Origins***

Rename to 'Assassin’s Creed Legends: Legacy'

* ‘Origins’ is used instead for a new addition to the franchise, above.
* Bayek would not >!found the Hidden Ones (or Assassins)!< at the end of the main storyline, but instead provides inspiration for the Brotherhood and the Creed. That is his ‘legacy’.
* Disadvantage is that ‘Legends: Legacy’ is a bit of a tongue-twister.
* Alternatives are 'Assassin’s Creed Legends: Echoes' (echoing into the future of the Brotherhood) or 'Assassin’s Creed Legends: Book of Dead' (long-winded, but Egypt-related and sounds like an assassin's kill-list).

151,1e9q0is,pizzapockets1234,1721683726.0,What is the siege team doing?,40,41,"First of all I think the biggest question is what does the siege team actually accomplish on a daily basis? The game is so full of bugs and problems and even the small ones will remain unfixed likely for weeks/months, even something as simple as the last spawn on skyscraper having no name. 

The game is completely unplayable due to cheaters on pc which once again I see no progress on, my entire ranked 5 stack including me have quit the game until we can actually play a single legit game without a cheater which currently isn’t even remotely possible. 

The support is a absolute joke, me and my stack lost over 200+ elo to obvious spin botters/ 
rage cheaters but we’ve never got any rollback, I recorded the match replay of some of these people and spent hours collecting the names of all the cheaters and all the people they are intentionally boosting from copper to champ with their cheats (about 50 accounts in total) and it’s been about a week with not even as much as a response on my support ticket and I think anybody who has ever had to use ubi support can vouch how awful it is 90% of the time and it usually ends up in them saying “we do not have the ability to help with this issue” or something to that extent. 

Everytime they post anything on social media the comments show a major majority of the community is unhappy and feels unheard and ignored, not many people are discussing it but I also find it kinda wild in the middle of all these cheater problems Ubisoft gave a twitch streamer charm to a person who was previously banned for cheating. 

The servers are down literally all the time or lagging which they don’t even compensate the playerbase for anymore. 

Lastly it’s pretty obvious nobody is listening or working on balancing anything, before the shield buff I think most people were fine with how the shields worked, that was until ubi decided to “nerf shields” but all they did was make them annoyingly overpowered and unbalanced and with some practice and a tiny bit of luck they can easily get you many many kills where before they were more of a support operator and weren’t so painfully OP.


TLDR/Conclusion 

So for all these reasons I can say from my perspective at least, the siege team is not working on fixing bugs, stopping cheaters, providing useful support, banning boosted accounts, boosters/boosting services and cheaters, player relations and keeping the playerbase happy, maintaining stable servers or properly balancing operators (especially shields). 

So what are they working on? What are they doing? The game is falling apart and there isn’t a single aspect they seem to be working on so what exactly are they even doing all day besides sitting down at their desks and staring into space? They have some major problems with the game, none of which they appear to have any urgency or interest whatsoever in fixing or working on, at this point a job at Ubisoft isnt looking too bad, at least you know you’ll never have to get any work done and when half the playerbase is quitting due to developer incompetence you’ll continue to get your paycheque for sleeping in your office for 6 hours and going home 💀

It seems the only thing they focus on is making and selling cosmetics which they can’t even do right because recently all the skins they’ve been making have been awful ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1e9q0is/what_is_the_siege_team_doing/

155,1gc28be,SoSneeKee,1729883697.0,Ubisoft Support Experience,12,8,"Hello, everyone.  2 years ago, I signed up for a Referral Program for Rainbow Six Siege. If the program were completed, you would be granted an in-game skin.  I completed the program according to all parameters, but never received any reward. The program showed completed on my user.  However, the progression was stuck for multiple of my participants I recruited. No matter how many games we played, the progress bar would not increase. After filing a support case, which was subsequently escalated to an internal team, it was confirmed that the progress tracking was bugged and thus failed to deliver the reward that I earned.  At the time, ubisoft support said there is nothing they could do, as there was no way for them to generate a skin for my account.  I dropped it because I believed that this made sense at the time. Fast forward 2 years to now.  With the inception of Rainbow6 marketplace, players can obtain skins from past events, challenges, etc, so long as they have enough r6 currency to pay for it.  Thus, I opened a new support case in hopes Ubisoft Support could either provide me with the r6 credits necessary to buy the skin, or buy the skin themselves and help transfer it to my account.  Below is a record of my experience with this issue.

After referencing previous cases and once again providing screenshots that the progression tracking was bugged, an Ubi rep escalated my case again.  The result they found was that the tracking was indeed bugged at the time, which is why I never got the skin.  Thus, I explained that this skin is now available on marketplace and requested the allotted amount of credits so I may purchase it at no expense to myself.  For reference, this skin is now worth $700USD+/88k  r6 credits+ due to its rarity.  This is why I cannot just buy it myself. Ubisoft support once again told me there is nothing they could do, which I find hard to believe.  How is a support team that assists with r6 credit issues unable to issue r6 credits? They then said ""sorry about that!"" and closed my case.  Naturally, I reopened the case and asked to speak with someone who COULD help me.  Well, support continued to stonewall me, citing that the rewards program was over by the time I opened a case.  This is true, but their own website says that rewards may take 24hr+ to appear on the account, so how could I have known there was a bug before that 24hr time period?  I pushed this issue with support and continued to reopen the case, but they have now resorted to copying/pasting canned responses and bullying me with the threat of support strikes due to ""inappropriate behavior on this case."" As far as I can tell, the only inappropriate thing I've done here is ask Ubisoft Support to do their jobs. I have meticulously provided every shred of detail and evidence they requested regarding this issue.  I had to bother real-life friends to reinstall this game to help me with this referral program two years ago, then bother them again for screenshots proving it is bugged.  Ubisoft does not seem to care and refuses to provide me with a fake, in-game currency to resolve this issue.  It is a very simple solution in my eyes, but they claim there is nothing anyone at the company can do.

I have played this game since day 1 early access, with 9 years of purchase history illustrating my support of this game. My intention is not to generate malice towards Ubi Support, it is to give you some insight on what the ubisoft support experience is like: ""Yes we see proof of the issue, yes the issue was our fault, no we will not do anything about it whatsoever. Sorry you are out $700+, just let it slide this time, okay?"" I have included my entire correspondence with support regarding this matter so you may independently decide who is at fault here.  Please do not harass ubi representatives below.  I have censored the individual rep names to prevent this. It is extremely frustrating that they cannot facilitate such a simple request. I just want the damn skin that I earned.

I wish Ubisoft would provide just a bit more support for the main game.

the problem seems to be caused by the latest windows update (according to some other people on the internet).

trying to uninstall the update did not work for me since the update is refusing to be uninstalled.

also, tried to repair / uninstall easy anticheat

also, tried to log in to a different user / profile

also, tried other game that uses easy anticheat (fall guys (which uses epic games launcher and not Ubisoft)) and got the same error.

also, tried to enable / Disable memory integrity / kernel mode hardware enforced stack protection and the other settings in the cored isolation in windows security settings

also, tried system restore. which failed.

and of course running the game as Admin / verify files

Anyone can help?

My husband and I just got back from a 3 week vacation in Japan and while we were there all his socials were hacked. He managed to get everything back except his instagram. However, when we got home the first thing he did was get on Xbox to play Siege with his friend just to find out his Ubisoft account had been hacked. He is completely devastated and I feel terrible. He has played Siege since it has came out and he had tons of rare skins and things that he was super proud of. Now, he’s debating quitting gaming all together. He’s emailed Ubisoft support but told me that they never respond or reach out so it’s probably gone for good. Is there anything at all we can do? Or anything I can do to help him? I really want to get it resolved, as it was one thing he was very proud and passionate about. I know this is a Siege page and that you all aren’t Ubisoft, however I’m posting here in hopes someone else went through this and got it resolved and could send me advice.

166,1g97hj5,AintNoLaLiLuLe,1729563460.0,My humble collection and opinions on the series as a whole,138,21,"Day 1 Splinter Cell enjoyer here. This sub has become an absolute cesspool full of copium for a remake that likely won't come out so here's something different for a change.

Originally got into the series exclusively on the PS2 until I got a 360 and then PC - my PS2 copies are long gone. Here are some hot takes and opinions on each installment:

Splinter Cell: The game that started it all, and I'm very fond of it. The graphics and gameplay were unheard of at the time and I spent years playing it as a kid. I've played every version of this game and the PC version is by far the worst, mostly coming down to the awful keyboard/mouse controls. I've got the steam version, Uplay Version, PC disk, and *had* the PS2 & GBA copies at one point in time in my childhood. The best way to play is emulating the PS2 or Xbox version depending if you want the bonus levels on either platform.

Pandora Tomorrow: Weakest game in the series (minus essentials) by a longshot. Horrible controls and lack of support for modern graphics cards (Shadows only render using Voodoo graphics unless you wanna use DGVoodoo. The original SC thankfully has a fallback mode so it's less of an issue) make this game an absolute chore to play on PC. Also, Allstate Lambert sucks. I prefer emulating the PS2 version on my steam deck.

Chaos Theory: The mother of all stealth games! I've sunk quite literally thousands of hours into this game between every version. There is no understating how incredible this game is and it will always be my favourite game of all-time. The PC version is my preferred way to play after some graphics mods and fixed controller support via SCfix. It works great on my gaming PC and steam deck. Honourable mention to the NDS copy of this stellar game (I *used* to have it as a kid and loved it, fight me).

Double Agent: I know this will rustle some jimmies but the 360 version is better than the OG Xbox/PS2 copies of the game, though I really liked those ones too. The jump from Chaos Theory's already amazing graphics to DA when it came out was incredible even though I played them on a 32inch CRT way back in the day. The MP was great, although not as great as CTs. I prefer the 360 version of v1 over the PC strictly because of the bugs and frustrating amount of configuration needed on the PC. I prefer emulating the PS2 version of v2 on the steam deck.

Conviction: I was hyped for years for this game, from when it was just the tech demo we never got to play, to the revised version. Although not the strongest in the series, it was a nice change in pace and co-op/deniable ops were insane to play with my friends and on xbox live. I prefer the PC version primarily because of the graphics and framerate.

Blacklist: Hot take, this is the second best game in the series. I bought every copy of this game, including the Wii U version! Since my PS3 and Wii U copies were digital and those systems are long gone, I didn't get to picture them here. This game was the perfect combination of methodical stealth from traditional entries and the *optional* action of conviction. I've got probably well over 1000 hours between all versions of the game with 400 just in the PC version. I prefer the PC version of this game simply because of the graphics and ability to play it on my steam deck. I'm currently playing through the Chaos Theory mod and its awesome!

Play these games in order and absolutely do not start with Chaos Theory, it will ruin your appreciation for the first 2 games. I've found that if you're playing on PC only, play them like this:

SC 1&2: Emulate the PC/Xbox Versions
SCCT: Play the PC version with SCFix and other fixes here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=728093866
DA: Play the PC version with the fixes here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=935210001
Convicton: Just play the steam/uplay verison
Blacklist: Just play the steam/uplay version

Remake: I want a remake more than anyone in the world, but it's not happening with the current state of Ubisoft. Even if there was a possibility of a remake coming out, why would anyone trust modern-day ubisoft to deliver on this masterpiece of a series? We've seen where other iconic ubisoft franchises have gone in the past decade and I frankly do not want to see another entry if it's going to be full of farcry tower exploration, weak storytelling and shoehorned identity politics. The game is in development hell for a reason and if it's not going to be respectful to the rest of the series and the fans, I don't want it.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",https://i.redd.it/kq2djzf5w7wd1.jpeg

This is absolutely insane , how desensitized people are to death threats , It's incredibly vile and disgusting , especially over mundane topics like video game discussion. 

It's obviously a empty threat , but it's distressing nonetheless , WHAT THE HELL is going on with this sub?  Anti-Woke sentiments in comments , constant ubisoft slandering and unrelated discourse , it's just sad. 

Pathetic 

Edit: ""no need to make a post about it"" oh sorry , I didn't get the memo that it was just the causal Saturday where we throw death threats at each other. Sorry for taking up 1kb of space with my post on the internet and bothering you about this tiny issue. 


Edit 2: I woke up fully expecting to see more messages telling me I’m being ""soft"" and dismissing the situation as just the internet being the internet. To my surprise, I received so many heartwarming responses from people who truly understood how serious this is. Death threats, even if fake, are inhumane and insensitive. The more we ignore and normalize them, the more they’ll continue to happen.

172,1g18x0t,ileanaki,1728650700.0,Ubisoft Support Ignoring Cheating Reports – Cheater Still Active in Rainbow Six Siege,1,19,"Hey fellow Siege players,

I’m reaching out to the community because I’ve been dealing with an ongoing issue, and Ubisoft Support hasn’t taken any real action to resolve it. I’ve reported a blatant cheater multiple times using the in-game report system, but they’re still active, ruining matches for everyone involved.

Here’s what’s going on:

* **Type of Cheating:** Wallhacking
* **Frequency:** I’ve encountered this player in multiple games, and the cheating is obvious. Despite reporting them through the in-game system, nothing seems to be happening.

I’ve contacted Ubisoft Support multiple times, but I keep getting generic responses telling me to “use the in-game report system” or that they “cannot communicate the outcome of the investigation.” While I understand they can’t share details, the fact that this player is still cheating in plain sight weeks later is incredibly frustrating.

I’ve even posted the player on [reputation.gg](http://reputation.gg) and he already got a reputation ban.

**Has anyone else had a similar experience with reporting cheaters and not seeing any action? How can we, as a community, get Ubisoft to take this seriously?**

I’m considering escalating this issue further and possibly making it more visible on other platforms, but I wanted to see if any of you have suggestions or success stories with getting cheating reports addressed.

Let’s keep Siege fun and fair!

Thanks for any advice or support.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1g18x0t/ubisoft_support_ignoring_cheating_reports_cheater/
173,1g1j7xt,sevansup,1728678331.0,"Ubisoft ""fixed"" an automatic cloud save issue in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown by removing the feature altogether, whereas Steam Cloud would have worked perfectly fine.",442,40,"This happened almost two months ago. [Here are the patch notes.](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2751000/view/6215616669618800922)

I've been waiting to post this because I keep hoping that Ubisoft will patch the feature back in, but I don't think it will happen.

I remembered that [Ubisoft removed cloud saves from Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag on PC](https://x.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1645739808126279680) and to this day still hasn't brought them back, despite other AC games supporting that feature.

This time they disabled automatic cloud saves in Prince of Persia in order to prevent an issue some people were having where progress was lost. But the ironic part is [now people are losing progress anyways by not knowing that they have to manually upload their saves](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2751000/discussions/0/4426562436920028247/). Perhaps they are playing on multiple devices, or they uninstalled the game and came back to it later to see their saves gone.

To be fair, they did add a feature that enables you to at least **manually** back up one of your saves to the cloud, but it isn't obvious. If you have to stop playing in a hurry, you may easily forget to upload your save. And many users aren't aware of this ""feature"" in the first place.

Here are some more examples of people being confused about their saves missing after this update. Yes, many of these are Steam Deck examples because A) Deck users are more likely to be playing a game on multiple devices, and B) This style of game is especially well suited to a handheld. But others will notice it over time when they come back in 3, 4, 10 years to 100% the game and see their saves are gone.

[Example 1 (literally posted today)](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2751000/discussions/0/6989114975920757902/)

[Example 2](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2751000/discussions/0/4854406759561032370/)

[Example 3](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2751000/discussions/0/4854406951640524504/)

[Example 4](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2751000/discussions/0/4854406759563145357/)

**I think it's reasonable to assume in 2024 that your saves will just automatically upload to the cloud for a game from an AAA publisher.** It seems that this is an issue that wouldn't be a problem if Ubisoft Connect wasn't required on PC, and if Ubisoft made use of the Steam Cloud feature which already works great.

In addition to things like having to hunt down your phone that you left in another room in order to enter a 2FA code, remember a 2nd password, etc. I feel Ubisoft is introducing unnecessary barriers to people just playing their games, and I wouldn't be surprised if it contributes towards the negative sentiment towards them + slower sales.

**This issue further highlights that Ubisoft Connect should be optional for features like cross-progression, rewards, etc. If they led with the carrot vs the stick, people wouldn't have such a problem with it. Especially when the stick isn't working as intended.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1g1j7xt/ubisoft_fixed_an_automatic_cloud_save_issue_in/

Note: No FromSoftware Games discounted, no Stellar Blade. Not a lot of horror games but that should change soon. Halloween PSN sale should launch Oct. 23.

**PSN Deal of the Week:** [**Lies of P (-40$, $41.99)**](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/eff78812-7d8a-4871-935d-71626db857fe/1)

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

* **NBA 2K25 (-30%, $48.99)** – Literally the only basketball game in town. If you like basketball, the NBA, you pretty much only have this as your lone choice. Not a bad entry, but be prepared for gargantuan patches.
* **Madden NFL 25 (-35%, $45.49)** – Same as with the NBA 2K series, this is the only NFL game on consoles.
* **EA Sports MVP Bundle: Madden NFL 25 + College Football 25 (-25%, $112.49)** – Don’t play football games, but based on reviews, College Football is the superior title. If you’re planning on picking both up, this is the first time it’s on sale.
* **Destiny 2: The Final Shape (-40%, $29.99)** – Doesn’t go on sale often. The latest expansion for Destiny 2.
* **GTA 5 (-50%, $19.99)** – PS4 version is $5 less. This is the lowest it’ll go, so if you’re one of the handful that still doesn’t own this, here’s your chance to line Rockstar’s coffers.
* **Hogwarts Legacy (-70%, $20.99)** – PS4 version is a few bucks less, but this is the version to get. At that price, this should be an impulse buy unless you hate wizards, witches or casting spells. Prepare to make a name for yourself as the youngest wizard with the highest killcount in history.
* **Star Wars Jedi Survivor (-60%, $27.99)** – PS4 version surprisingly costs more. This is the version to get. Souls but with a Jedi flavor. Better than the first one in almost every way, and Cal can run properly here. Third game in development, so this is a good time to get into the franchise.
* **It Takes Two (-75%, $9.99)** – Goes on sale almost every other week. Definitely worth it, but just bear in mind you need a co-op partner to play this,
* **Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered (-50%, $24.99)** – Rarely goes on sale, and this isn’t a bad price at all. If you haven’t played this franchise yet, now might be a good start.
* **Cyberpunk 2077 (-40%, $29.99)** – Rocky launch, but now in a stable state. This is what CDPR envisioned for the game. Definitely worth a buy now.
* **Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC (-15%, $25.49)** – Jampacked with content. If you’re done with the main story, then pick this up.
* **Red Dead Redemption 2(-67%, $19.79)** – Even if you’re not a fan of Westerns, this is still a must-play. Amazing story, gameplay and loads of Easter eggs. Actually prefer this over GTA5.
* **Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart (-58%, $29.39)** – Amazing platformer, loads of weapons to use. Has that rift mechanic that’s only possible on PS5. Give this a shot.
* **Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League (-80%, $13.99)** – The lowest I’ve seen this on PSN. Might be heading to PS Plus soon? It’s worth a try at that price, but depends on how much you like these type of games. Just be mindful that support should be ceasing soon.
* *Mortal Kombat 11 (-50%, $24.99)* – Possibly the lowest I’ve seen it on PSN so far. Your dose of violence, and latest Khaos Reigns content drop was just released and brings Animalities.
* **Avatar Frontiers of Pandora (-50%, $34.99)** – Might be the lowest it’s been on PSN without a bundle. Ubisoft’s formula but with an Avatar coating. Better than expected.
* **Still Wakes the Deep (-33%, $23.44)** – Fairly new. Have this but haven’t started yet. Surprised to see it here this fast.
* **Cuphead (-30%, $13.99)** – DLC is also on sale. Gorgeous visuals, tight controls but hard as hell.
* **F1 24 (-50%, $34.99)** – Latest F1 game from Codemasters. If you’re a fan, then this is a good buy.
* **The Last of Us Part 1 Digital Deluxe (-38%, $49.59)** – Just in case you haven’t played this, still a bit high.
* **WWE 2K24 (-50%, $49.99)** – Free this month for PS+, solid wrestling game and still getting DLCs.
* **Skull and Bones (-60%, $27.99)** – Unsure how well this turned out, but apparently there’s enough players to support its seasonal content.
* **Witcher 3 (-75%, $9.99)** – Super low price, and this is one of my all-time fave games. Fantastic side quests, meaty experience all around. Once you get past the floaty controls/combat, and once it clicks, it’s one hell of an experience. Expansion is also on sale and worth the price.
* **Battlefield 2042 (-$85%, $10.49)** – Worth it at that price. Game is in a much better state now than before.
* **AC Valhalla (-75%, $14.99)** – Assassin’s Creed Vikings! Insane amount of content, though overstays its welcome a bit.
* **Borderlands 3 (-90%, $5.99)** – Looter shooter but not live service. Insane action, and a steal at that price.
* **Earth Defense Force 6 (-20%, $47.99)** – If you dig these types of games, might be worth a pickup.
* **The Outlast Trials (-33%, $33.49)** – Multiplayer-focused horror game. Still getting lots of support.
* **GTA The Trilogy (-50%, $29.99)** – Unsure how performance is nowadays. Three games in one in case you want more GTA gaming before GTA6 drops.
* **Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy (-60%, $15.99)** – Crash platforming. Harder than it looks.
* **Mafia Trilogy (-75%, $14.99)** – Three Mafia games in one. Definitely not a bad deal, and there’s a new one on the way.
* **Star Wars Battlefront 2 (-70%, $5.99)** – Definitely worth the price. No content support incoming, but servers still up and someone said here previously that there’s no shortage of players. Fun to smash people around playing as your favorite Star Wars character.
* **LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga (-75%, $14.99)** – Star Wars adventure with Lego humor. Fun to play with kids or your partner.
* **Payday 3 (-60%, $15.99)** – Lowest I’ve seen this on PSN. Not sure if worth it now, but still getting loads of support.
* **Horizon Burning Shores (-50%, $9.99)** – First time I’ve seen this on sale. In case you want more for the game, then this DLC should scratch that itch.
* **Powerwash Simulator (-30%, $17.49)** – Doesn’t go on sale often. Surprisingly fun and getting regular support.
* **Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order (-75%, $9.99)** – If you’re planning on playing the trilogy, then this is your starting point. Lots of backtracking and Cal runs like he has crap in his pants that will never be OK.
* **Dead by Daylight Gold Edition (-40%,$41.99)** – Heavily supported, and DLCs are also on sale. Asymmetrical horror game for those who want something different.
* **Metro Saga Bundle (-85%, $8.99)** – Three games from the Metro franchise at a discounted rate.
* **Far Cry 6 (-75%, $14.99)** – Solid first-person campaign, and stars Giancarlo Esposito as the baddie.
* **Detroit Become Human (-50%, $9.99)** – More of an interactive movie than a game, but still solid. If you haven’t played Quantic’s games, it’s like Supermassive’s titles.
* **Midnight Suns (-75%, $17.49)** – Strategy with Marvel characters. Surprisingly fun even without MCU likenesses, and has solid length and depth.
* **Pacific Drive (-40%, $17.99)** – First-person driving survival game that’s still getting a lot of support.
* **Divinity Original Sin 2 (-65%, $20.99)** – Larian’s breakout hit. If you want your RPGs deep and long.
* **Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition (-20%, $15.99) –** First time this is on sale. If you ever wanted to play the cult classic, then this is the newest way of doing so. You might finish it in time for the sequel which should be coming any day now…
* **Persona 3 Reload Digital Deluxe Edition (-40%, $47.99) –** If you’re looking to play Persona 3, then this is it. Just got it last DLC drop this September as well.
* **System Shock (-40%, $23.99)** – Remake of a classic. SHODAN!
* **For Honor (-85%, $4.49)** – Multiplayer action game but more melee focused. Still getting loads of support after all these years.
* **Flintlock Siege of Dawn (-25%, $29.99)** – AA action game that didn’t sell well. Might be worth a look? Surely will go down in price more in a few months though.
* **Sifu (-60%, $15.99)** – Beat-’em-up but with more modern mechanics. Neat aging system for life, and harder than expected. Fun when you know what you’re doing.
* **Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 Turbocharged (-75%, $12.49)** -Still getting support. If you like your racing games more arcade-y than sim.
* **Hi-Fi Rush (-40%, $17.99)** – Tango’s last game before leaving Microsoft. JP style action-adventure. GOTY contender as well.
* **Mass Effect Legendary Edition (-85%, $8.99)** – Will never not recommend this. Probably my fave RPG trilogy of all-time. You can get your money’s worth with just the first game, but to have your decisions carry over until the last one? Yean, BioWare at their peak!
* **LA Noire (-50%, $19.99)** – Still priced high for an old game. Amazing visuals and makes you feel like a detective.
* **Back 4 Blood (-90%, $5.99)** – Support has ended but still fun if you can round up friends for co-op.
* **Need for Speed Unbound (-85%, $10.49)** – Still getting support somewhat. Arcade racing and has a less serious take on the franchise. Controls feel a bit floaty for me.
* **Banishers Ghosts of New Eden (-30%, $41.99)** – Criminally underrated game. Not AAA, but certain aspects of it do feel AAA. Combat is ists weakest link but it has a lot of content, good story and loads of secrets.
* **Tomb Raider I-III Remastered (-50%, $14.99)** – The old Tomb Raider games but with added sheen. Prepare for pixelated Lara and lots of mindless jumping while shooting.
* **Gotham Knights (-80%, $13.99)** – Underperformed but still fun. At that price, might be worth jumping into it just to test out the combos you can pull off since each character has their own moveset.
* **Lords of the Fallen (-50%, $34.99)** – The reboot. Sequel is in development and the studio pushed out a ton of new features and whatnot.
* **Crash Bandicoot Bundle: N. Sane Trilogy + CTR Nitro-Fueled (-65%, $26.24) –** Crash overload! Platforming and kart racing in a bundle.
* **Titanfall 2 (-75%, $4.99)** – One of the best FPS’ ever made. Play the campaign and jump into the multiplayer to get melted by sweats.
* **Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes (-35%, $32.49)** – Old-school RPG that surprisingly sold and reviewed well. Still getting support and this is the first time it’s on sale on PSN if I’m not mistaken.
* **Shadow of the Tomb Raider (-80%, $3.99)** – Didn’t finish it, but it’s a solid third-person action game. At that price? Yeah, definitely worth a shot.
* **Alone in the Dark (-30%, $41.99)** – Nota successful remake, but not a bad one either. It’s OK. Combat is nothing special and graphics won’t blow anyone away. Ambience is fine, and worth a look for horror fans.
* **A Plague Tale Bundle (-60%, $31.99)** – Don’t play if you get scared of rats, but this is a solid two games and story is well done.
* **Control – (-80%, $7.99)** – Remedy’s pure action game. In the same universe as Alan Wake. This includes the DLCs as well.
* **Hell Let Loose (-40%, $35.99)** – Era multiplayer FPS that’s still getting a lot of support from the devs.
* **The Division 2 Ultimate (-75%, $14.99)** – Fun especially with friends. Includes Warlords of NY expansion. Still getting support and getting new story DLC next year.
* **The Order 1886 (-50%, $9.99)** – Super short but sweet. Loved this when it was released. Amazing visuals then. Shame we won’t see what happens to the tale.
* **Evil West (-60%, $23.99)** – Vampire action game. AA fare but not bad at all. Expect jank and some unpolished visuals but could do worse than this.
* **Cult of the Lamb Cultist Edition (-50%, $14.99)** – Still getting supported. Fun and surprisingly deep. Who knew it was so much fun to have your own cult.
* **Nioh Collection (-58%, $29.39) –** Team Nnja’s Souls game. Hard as nails though, but lots of fans swear how good these games are.
* **Tomb Raider Definitive (-80%, $3.99)** – The first game in the new Tomb Raider trilogy. Solid action games.
* **Rise of the Tomb Raider (-80%, $5.99)** – You can literally get all three games for less than $15.
* **Kena Bridge of Spirits (-60%, $15.99)** – Made waves before. Fun adventure game. Has you collecting hats.
* **Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade (-42%, $3.79)** – If you haven’t played this yet, go get started. Wil make you understand why FF7 is one of the most revered games of all-time.
* **Mega Man X Legacy Collection (-60%, $7.99)** – Includes Mega Man X1-X4. Solid titles from the 32-bit era.
* **LOTR Gollum (-85%, $8.99)** – Lowest I’ve ever seen it on PSN. Promised patches never came. Still not worth it. Buy it if you want to torture your friends.
* **Zombie Army 4 (-90%, $4.99)** – From Rebellion. Content support has ended, but this is a surprisingly fun shooter.
* **Returnal Digital Deluxe (-50%, $39.99)** – Housemarque’s first AAA title. Fun, but might not be everyone’s cup of tea.
* **Outriders Complete  (-35%, $19.49)** – Criminally underrated. Not live service but plays like one. Includes story expansion. Play with friends and you will have a ball trying on different builds.
* **Star Wars Squadrons (-80%, $7.99)** – Support has ended but the most recent game where we can dogfight with Star Wars ships.
* **Anthem (-85%, $2.99)** – Lacks content, but at that price? Might be worth to play through the campaign. Fantastic feeling of flight.
* **Prey (-80%, $5.99)** – Arkane’s finest work according to some.
* **Quantum Error (-50%, $14.99)** – Might get a deeper discount for Halloween. Janky survival horror.
* **Dredge Complete Edition (-20%, $31.59)** – Horror fishing game. Yes, you read that right. Still getting loads of support.
* **Dishonored Death of the Outsider Bundle (-80%, $11.99)** – Arkane’s finest work? Maybe the most popular.
* **Fort Solis (-35%, $22.74) –** More walking simulator than horror. If it worked for Kojima…",https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fzwbkm/playstation_store_fall_savings_promotion_launches/

178,1g0p9qf,DomFakker37,1728584032.0,I actually love AC: Unity! Sorry (or not?) for being 10 years late.,98,59,"From what I've read, Unity has one of the worst reputations of all the AC games, but if I understand it correctly, the reason for this comes mostly out of the technical issues the game had when it launched back in 2014. I guess I'm glad I did not know anything about the game back then, thus my experience was not ruined.

I just started it recently and the game is amazing! Sure, it gets a little time to get used to, but the visuals are astonishing, the cutscenes are not boring, the story is (despite some small flaws) really good and the missions are rich!

**Visuals:**

The details in faces are almost unbelievable, considering the game came out in 2014. I probably can't name any game that looked that good back in that time except The Witcher or GTA V, which really surprised me. Not only that, the streets of Paris look really good, whether it's the dirty outskirts or the noble houses of the rich people. This is also the first AC game where there is that many pedestrians just randomly doing their stuff and blocking your way. I suppose this is a performance issue, and since this was the first AC released for PS4 (correct me if I'm wrong), I understand that the devs were able to go a step further this time.

**Missions:**

The quests aren't repetitive at all, there was not a single time when I would feel bored. The main story missions are innovative, the side quests are not long, they're simple (that goes to basically every side mission, such as helping your assassin fellows or helping your Social houses etc). I also adore the way the game handles assassinations, it basically gives you multiple options how to enter, how to kill and how to deal with situations. I love that you can simply run at your target and stab them, but you can think your approach through and choose your way of distracting the guards and getting in. There is also not that many tailing missions, which AC series is (mostly negatively) famous for, which I really appreciate.

**Collectibles:**

Another typical AC mechanic (not only, I guess). I remember being tired to death when collecting feathers in Ezio's trilogy. I also hated collecting anything in Connor's game. But Unity? Nothing feels forced. There are chests that have some kind of interaction to it, which is fun. There are cockades that are your typical AC collectible, you usually have to free-run or climb to get them, nothing excessively boring though. And there are side-missions that, as I menitoned, are not long enough to be boring, even though they're sometimes vague thanks to that, so completing them feels good, unlike some previous AC titles.

**Controls:**

They feel clunky when one starts with Unity right after finishing Black Flag and Rogue, and they get some time getting used to, but once you do, the controlled descent is an amazing thing and so is the intentional climbing. I still sometimes jump up instead of jumping down just cause it's not intuitive for me, but I guess I'll learn that. The combat system is not bad at all, even though it's tough for a beginner, who is used to clear fights without even upgrading his weapons, to die after two hits. Not being able to use enemies as Human Shiled and not being able to Whistle is surprising and not a welcome choice, but again, it's not that hard to get used to the new system.

**Coop:**

This is the only thing that I have a problem with, since it seems that [since 30th September, noone has achieved a PS trophy that is strictly linked to coop play](https://psnprofiles.com/trophy/3072-assassins-creed-unity/46-never-say-die). That, sadly, applies to me as well, since I'm unable to connect to anyone, I just get the ""Connection Failed 0x70000006 Error"". And I'm not the only one, many people playing on consoles seem to have the same issue. It seems like the servers are down, even though on Ubisoft's page it says that they're not. I tried going through their PS5 troubleshooting guide and I tried following some random advice from people with similar issue but nothing worked for me. It's a shame, since this is the only thing that prevents me from getting the platinum trophy, but most importantly, I can't enjoy the coop gameplay that I was really looking forward to, especially since I was hoping for something better than that poorly executed multiplayer from Black Flag. I contacted the Ubisoft Support, currently waiting for their reponse, but in case anyone too has this issue, please, let me know.

  
So that's it, that's my post, AC: Unity is awesome and I really hope I'll be able to enjoy 100% of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1g0p9qf/i_actually_love_ac_unity_sorry_or_not_for_being/

Assassins Creed,Division, Splinter Cell, Far Cry, Rainbow, and Ghost Recon. Splinter Cell has been off the radar since 2014 (Blacklist came 2013). Siege is almost 10 years old. Division only has 2 games and honestly we have the most stable online community in the games in my opinion. Then Heartlands got canceled. And now we're waiting on 3. Still. Far Cry and Assassins Creed fall ill to the same things. ""We"" didn't want level systems and ""looter shooters"". And the story got stale and gameplay repetitive.  Far Cry plots starting at 3: Pirates vs Natives and MC, Dictatorship vs rebels, Cult vs rebels, Dictatorship vs rebels. Ghost Recon Breakpoint came in 2019. It's a great game except it feels repetitive but still fun. I don't know, it feels like Assassins Creed isn't even Assassins Creed anymore. Ghost Recon and Div are barely holding on it seems like. Please listen to your fan base. Whats left of it I guess. Ubisoft is a cornerstone to my gaming childhood. I don't want people to fail or people to lose jobs.

Or should I wait for pre orders for the game to go live again and then claim my copy? I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I don't know of any alternatives.

Update: claimed the game, it's now added to my account. Ubisoft support says it won't get removed or auto refunded.

1) community is full of shit, literally anytime I give callouts in the mic disaster strucks. This includes:
-Guys shouting ""WOMAN?!"" in the mic all game
-Sexists comments 
-Rape threats

2)Game doesn't run on linux, the reason I already had a break from this game after thunderbird's release up to release of Deimos, windows nowadays just sucks, yet ubisoft are not willing to turn on linux support besides it taking no effort at all these days. Their reasoning are cheater problems, but most players know, that despite no linux support, this game is already infested with cheaters to the point where every second high-rank match someone is cheating. So yeah, cheaters don't need linux.

3) cheater problem, see the prior point.

4) devs generally don't listen to the community, most balance changes are bs and literally noone was asking for them

That's really unfortunate, game is still one of the better shooters and can be fun, but I got too fed up, there's too much shit being thrown at you, so it really isn't worth it sticking to it for some fun once in a while, honestly hope your experience is different, but until linux support, better anticheat and better moderation tools, I won't go back to this game, see yall in tf2 and dbd",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1fxtvyp/a_month_ago_i_completely_abandoned_siege_after/

I'm having a really frustrating issue with Rainbow Six Siege during ranked matches. I keep getting disconnected mid-game (I usually have a stable 19 ping), and I've submitted multiple support tickets to Ubisoft. Unfortunately, they haven't been able to provide any real solutions and just tell me they're ""working on it.""

This has been ongoing for a while, but it’s especially frustrating now because I can't rejoin the matches. I keep running into error codes like 4-0xfff0be25 and 2-0x0000c015. When I try to rejoin, I get error code 4-0xf, and if I'm kicked, it's the 2-0x0 error. Right before I get kicked, everything freezes, which is super annoying.

Interestingly, I don’t have these issues in standard, quick matches, or custom games—just ranked. I’ve followed numerous tutorials to fix these errors and have already tried all the troubleshooting steps provided by Ubisoft, including reinstalling the game and verifying my files.

If anyone has any insights or solutions, I’d really appreciate it. This is honestly the last thing I can think of before I just give up on ranked altogether. Thanks in advance for any help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1fxjg0z/constant_disconnections_in_siege_ranked_matches/

Not a lot of games in this sale, and you can check the full list to know what's available.

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is at from $79.99 to 54.39 for a limited time.

**Recommendations:**

* **GTA 5 - (67%, $19.79)** - For maybe the 2-3 people that still doesn't own this, now's your chance, as it doesn't get lower than this. Perhaps if GTA 6 is nearing launch maybe it will? But do you want to wait that long?
* **WWE 2K24 (-50%, $59.99)** - This game is free on PS Plus for October. If you aren't a member of PS Plus, then yeah, this is a solid wrestling game which has DLCs on the way.
* **Hogwarts Legacy Digital Deluxe (-70%, $23.99)** - Fun game regardless if you're a Harry Potter fan or not. No co-op or multiplayer of any kind but it lets you live the dream of becoming a mass murdering machine like Voldemort.
* **The Crew Motorfest (-60%, $27.99)** - Still getting support to this day. If you want a more arcade-y racing game.
* **AC Mirage (-50%, $24.99**) - Last year's Assassin's Creed game. Might not have made as big of a thud than Valhalla, but sitting at a generally favorable score at [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/assassins-creed-mirage/).
* **Red Dead Redemption 2 (-70%, $29.99)** - Some might not believe or like it, but this is even better than GTA 5. Fantastic story, engrossing side missions and loads of secrets. You can kill of racist mobs, get anal raped, encounter a vampire and more!
* **Madden 25 (-35%, $64.99)** - Your yearly NFL sim. Can't say if it's good or not since I'm not a football fan but if you're thinking of getting this one, then here you go.
* **Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League (-80%, $19.99)** - Season 3 just launched, but can't really say if this is worth it, since chances are, this will be on PS+ soon?!
* **Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (-55%, $40.49)** - Follow up to the Fallen Order, and better in almost every way. Cal doesn't run around like he has poop in his pants, backtracking issue has been more or less resolved. There's a third one on the way, so if you played the first one, then go pick this one up.
* **Borderlands 3 Next Level Bundle (-90%, $6.99)** - Includes a crapload of DLC and whatnot. Loads of Borderlands stuff are on sale, which fans might wnat to check out. This is well worth the purchase for those looking for some co-op loot action, and there's a free PS5 upgrade available as well.
* **A Way Out (-80%, $5.99)** - Usually on sale alongside It Takes Two, so no rush in getting it. Remember: this is a mandatory co-op game, so if you don't have anyone to play this with, don't bother.
* **Avatar Frontiers of Pandora (-50%, $39.99)** - Ubisoft open word in Avatar! All kidding aside, better than expected. The Gold Edition which includes the DLCs are also on sale.
* **Hi-Fi Rush Deluxe (-40%, $23.99)** - Tango's last game for Microsoft. GOTY contender and generally a different beast than what we usually get. Worth a pick up, but YouTube it first since the aesthetics, etc. might not be a fit for what you're looking for.
* **Midnight Suns (-75%, $19.99)** - Strategy Marvel game. Fun, good length and challenging. Not MCU but proves Marvel franchise can work in almost any genre as long as done right.
* **LEGO Star Wars Skywalker Saga Deluxe Edition (-75%, $17.49)** - Lighthearted Star Wars game you can play with friends or your kids. Familiar LEGO gameplay so expect loads of humor.
* **Mafia 3 Definitive Edition (--75%, $7.49)** - Period GTA but with a better story. There's a new one out next year, so if you want to get on-board this might be the time. Mafia 2 is also on sale for the same price.
* **AC Valhalla (-60%, $15.99)** - Viking Creed! Good action game, but be prepared to sink a lot of time into this.
* **Red Dead Redemption + RDR2 Bundle (-45%, $54.99)** - Not sure about RDR1 performance, but from a gameplay standpoint, should still hold up somewhat.
* **Gotham Knights (-80%, $17.99)** - Support has ended but the game is technically complete. Bat Family are the stars here and you can pull off some insane combos. Might be a bit repetitive, but not a bad game.
* **Back 4 Blood (-90%, $8.99)** - Zombie co-op FPS! Fun with friends. Support has ended, but servers are still up.
* **Alien Isolation The Collection (-85%, $5.99)** - Horror done with the Aliens franchise. Don't expect Resident Evil action, but loads of tense moments. Pick it up if you dig horror games.
* **XCOM 2 Collection (-90%, $9.99)** - Strategy game featuring guns, aliens and did I say strategy?! Not an easy game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fw64n3/psn_store_weekend_offer_sale_for_oct_4_launched/

as a former jacklust stan [i no longer ship the two anymore since it’s clear that they are half brothers, and i don’t support incest nor 
proship.] , i was in complete shock ,, a lil disappointed too.

BUT as the complete lore freak and theorist that i am, i like to think out of the box, dig deeper holes … think about all the plot twists that could possibly happen . 

the question that i really want a answer to is how the HELL is jack’s hair red if traveler nor leda have red hair? .. what if traveler finally decides to take that musty ass beanie off, thinking he’s dashiegames [no shame to dashie, love the guy sm] and reveals his HAIR COLOR?? what if his hair is RED ?? but that’s probably not possible due to the fact that wanderlust’s hair is black and si’ha’s hair is pink … maybe a red hair gene is roaming around in either leda’s or traveler’s family 

another possible theory i have is … leda cheated. leda could have possibly gotten knocked up by another man behind traveler’s back WHO actually has red hair ! .. but, leda decided to tell traveler that the child is his, and he believed her .

ANOTHER theory i have is … traveler has actually been living a double life . he got leda and nova PREGNANT at the same TIME ! … traveler decided to make up his mind ,, and he left to go be with nova permanently . this left leda broken , made her think she wasn’t good enough .. and this is what made her chase after perfection , this is what made her known today as night swan ! 🤯 [ngl this is actually my fav theory]

i also like to think that traveler made a promise to jack , promising he’ll come back to see him and his mother again . every day jack waited, and waited … and waited . but his father never came back .. poor jack , he deserves so much better ☹️

or maybe traveler is just like every other bum , dead beat , trash baby daddy and left for milk .. bro went 🥛🚶‍♂️💨

these are my theories and they’re most likely not possibilities … but WHO knows , just gotta wait till this game drops .. i been taking notice that ubisoft likes to slip lil plot twists into their stories lol 

i’m genuinely so excited to see what actually happens , i am in LOVE with the just dance lore , reason why i’m still a fan of 6+ years … i find it so unique for a DANCING game to have a LORE 😋 AND I LOVE GAMES WITH LORE 

i hope traveler knows he lost a good one cuz night swan / leda is … 😩 [IM SORRY]

207,1gc28be,SoSneeKee,1729883697.0,Ubisoft Support Experience,9,8,"Hello, everyone.  2 years ago, I signed up for a Referral Program for Rainbow Six Siege. If the program were completed, you would be granted an in-game skin.  I completed the program according to all parameters, but never received any reward. The program showed completed on my user.  However, the progression was stuck for multiple of my participants I recruited. No matter how many games we played, the progress bar would not increase. After filing a support case, which was subsequently escalated to an internal team, it was confirmed that the progress tracking was bugged and thus failed to deliver the reward that I earned.  At the time, ubisoft support said there is nothing they could do, as there was no way for them to generate a skin for my account.  I dropped it because I believed that this made sense at the time. Fast forward 2 years to now.  With the inception of Rainbow6 marketplace, players can obtain skins from past events, challenges, etc, so long as they have enough r6 currency to pay for it.  Thus, I opened a new support case in hopes Ubisoft Support could either provide me with the r6 credits necessary to buy the skin, or buy the skin themselves and help transfer it to my account.  Below is a record of my experience with this issue.

After referencing previous cases and once again providing screenshots that the progression tracking was bugged, an Ubi rep escalated my case again.  The result they found was that the tracking was indeed bugged at the time, which is why I never got the skin.  Thus, I explained that this skin is now available on marketplace and requested the allotted amount of credits so I may purchase it at no expense to myself.  For reference, this skin is now worth $700USD+/88k  r6 credits+ due to its rarity.  This is why I cannot just buy it myself. Ubisoft support once again told me there is nothing they could do, which I find hard to believe.  How is a support team that assists with r6 credit issues unable to issue r6 credits? They then said ""sorry about that!"" and closed my case.  Naturally, I reopened the case and asked to speak with someone who COULD help me.  Well, support continued to stonewall me, citing that the rewards program was over by the time I opened a case.  This is true, but their own website says that rewards may take 24hr+ to appear on the account, so how could I have known there was a bug before that 24hr time period?  I pushed this issue with support and continued to reopen the case, but they have now resorted to copying/pasting canned responses and bullying me with the threat of support strikes due to ""inappropriate behavior on this case."" As far as I can tell, the only inappropriate thing I've done here is ask Ubisoft Support to do their jobs. I have meticulously provided every shred of detail and evidence they requested regarding this issue.  I had to bother real-life friends to reinstall this game to help me with this referral program two years ago, then bother them again for screenshots proving it is bugged.  Ubisoft does not seem to care and refuses to provide me with a fake, in-game currency to resolve this issue.  It is a very simple solution in my eyes, but they claim there is nothing anyone at the company can do.

I have played this game since day 1 early access, with 9 years of purchase history illustrating my support of this game. My intention is not to generate malice towards Ubi Support, it is to give you some insight on what the ubisoft support experience is like: ""Yes we see proof of the issue, yes the issue was our fault, no we will not do anything about it whatsoever. Sorry you are out $700+, just let it slide this time, okay?"" I have included my entire correspondence with support regarding this matter so you may independently decide who is at fault here.  Please do not harass ubi representatives below.  I have censored the individual rep names to prevent this. It is extremely frustrating that they cannot facilitate such a simple request. I just want the damn skin that I earned.

## Season 2.0

Seasons were introduced to The Division 2 in March 2020 with the release of Warlords of New York. They have become a key aspect of the endgame, however, after four years, this model has reached its limit. To prepare for the game's future, they needed to reevaluate the season model, update it, and equip the game with the right tools to make each season truly unique. 

TU 22 & Seasons 2.0 offers an exciting mix of new gameplay elements, new story, and rewards, all presented in a fresh way that allows for greater creativity and surprise. The main idea behind Seasons 2.0 is to break away from the current seasonal model by transforming the entire experience. 

&nbsp;

### Seasonal Journey Missions

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season’s content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

### Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

&nbsp;

### Manhunt Scouts

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

&nbsp;

### Balancing - Weapons & Talents, Gear & Brand Sets, Exotic Weapons & Gear

With the introduction of Seasons 2.0, which brings new features like Modifiers, Scouts, Priority Objectives and the Seasonal Journey, we’ve taken a fresh approach to balancing, aiming to give different playstyles more distinct personalities.

This update will address a wide range of elements, including various weapon categories, Exotic weapons and gear, weapon mods, talents, and gear sets.

These new loot drop chances are exclusively available for characters at level 40 or above and are limited to regular versions of missions - they do not apply to ""invaded"" missions.

#Shades of Red

Year 6 Season 2: Shades of Red is marking the start of a new seasonal journey. With Aaron Keener in custody at the White House, he aims to strike a deal with The Division. Before Agents can learn what he knows, they have to secure the other members of Keener's team, starting with Theo Parnell.

&nbsp;

***
##SEASONS 2.0

###Seasonal Journey

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season's content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

###Seasonal Modifiers

=> [Season Modifiers]( https://i.imgur.com/XfduRhn.png)

The Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience: 

*   **Global Modifiers** set the overall theme of the season and are active at all times while the system is enabled, affecting the core gameplay loop. 
    *   This season, the theme is ""range."" The Global Modifier, ""Point Blank,"" grants a bonus damage based on distance from enemies. 
*   **Active Modifiers** function like ""ultimate"" abilities, giving your character a short burst of power. 
    *   Players can choose from a selection of Active Modifiers, but only one can be equipped at a time. This season, they manipulate the range zones set by the Global Modifier. 
*   **Passive Modifiers** work in conjunction with the Global Modifier, adding extra bonuses. 
    *   Players can equip up to three Passive Modifiers simultaneously. In the first season, these modifiers provide additional benefits based on the range zones from the Global Modifier. 
*   **Hostile Modifiers:** These represent how the enemies adapt to your new abilities. 
    *   As players progress through the season, enemies will gradually gain new abilities linked to specific enemy types, forcing you to use the Global, Passive, and Active Modifiers strategically to counter them. 

The modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges. 

&nbsp;

###Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

Players can choose from three objectives, selecting one based on limited information such as duration, reward category, and mission type. Once a selection is made, it is locked in, and the full details of the objective and its rewards will be revealed.

If none of the objectives appeal to the player, the system allows for rerolls and has an Abandon Objective feature. Players can earn reroll points by completing Priority Objectives, with a maximum of three rerolls stored at any time.

There is no limit to the number of Priority Objectives a player can complete, and rewards include XP, Season Pass XP, items, resources, and passive modifier unlocks.  

&nbsp;

###Manhunt Scouts

=> [Parnell Manhunt](https://i.imgur.com/khEGjlR.jpeg)

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

Each week, players can tackle a Scout, which consists of three different activities. These activities will vary, and players must solve a small riddle to complete each one. Activities should be completed in order, and once all three are finished, players will receive the Scout Reward.

Once all activities in a Scout are completed, players will receive a bigger reward, including a unique collectible. However, new Scouts cannot be accessed until the current one is completed.

By the end of the season, completing all Scouts unlocks the Manhunt Climax Mission, and finishing that unlocks the Master Climax Mission, so make sure to stay on track each week.

&nbsp;

The game becomes unresponsive. I noticed using MSI Afterburner and RivaTuner that after every frame drop, the **CPU usage spikes to around 90-100%**, while the **GPU usage drops to 0%**.  
I also observed that after each frame drop, I experience **high jitter/ping** and **packet loss**. I don't understand how to fix this. I have watched a lot of videos and guides, but nothing has changed.

I use Process Lasso to keep Ubisoft **processes at low priority** and **restricted to just 1 core** (the 4th core) (processes affinity).  
I set RainbowSix\_BE.exe to low priority and restricted it to just 1 core (the 4th core).

213,1gd9zha,himan1010,1730032594.0,Get DLC with the season pass or buy?,12,8,"So I am playing on xbox currently and have two options to get the DLCs
1. Get the season pass by purchasing the ubisoft+ membership
2. Just buy the dlc separately 

However both options have their caveats...

Season pass says that you can play the first episode for free, then again says that i can play the two DLCs out of the total 3 for free (and the dates mentioned in the description are outdated already)...
I am so confused here about it. 

A. Would it only allow me to play a part of the DLC? 

B. Would i have the access to the dlc even if the pass runs out?

C. I don't even know when does their season pass runs out cuz there's no date written anywhere.



Buying the DLCs separately is gonna be costly for me, so that's the least preferred...

Veterans, please help me out with this ",https://i.redd.it/njqoayh4naxd1.jpeg
214,1gd6crt,JokerUnique,1730017581.0,The Division 2 - Year 6 - Season 2: Shades of Red - Special Report,64,37,"#Stream Summary

=> [Shades of Red Trailer]( https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2287662980?t=0h0m14s)

This summary only covers the delta of what is already listed in the patch notes. 

&nbsp;

##Revisit Seasonal Modifiers

The goal is that each season is unique, and replaying an entire season with a modifier that you already know is also not something they think is fun for players that participate in every season. But what could happen is, that they bring a modifier back for a time-limited event – similar to the Throwback Event that we just had. 

&nbsp;

##Master Difficulty

Will only be applied to the Climax Mission of the Manhunt and not any other mission. 

It is a handcrafted experience that is intended to be hard in the area between legendary and incursion difficulty. 

&nbsp;

##Twitch Drops

=> [Image]( https://i.imgur.com/8F7O8fT.jpeg)

There will be a Twitch Drops campaign between October 29th and November 12th where you can watch Twitch Streams and earn multiple rewards. 

&nbsp;

## Friend Referral

=> [Insurgent Outfit]( https://i.imgur.com/rzbskrp.png) / [Backpack]( https://i.imgur.com/AnPT7xX.png)

As of October 31st, there is a new Friend Referral Program active. The old Stinger Hunter Outfit is still there for new players, but there is now also a second outfit. When you invite a player into the game, you get a new “Insurgent” outfit and backpack as reward. 

The main goal is that you do it again and not just once. You can also invite players back that have stopped playing. So, for example, when you bring back a player that had their last play session before June 2024, you can also get the reward.

The goal is to update the Friend Referral Program as we go through the seasons. 

&nbsp;

##Apparel Collection – S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

This apparel collection will become available in the in-game store later in the season.

&nbsp;

## Halloween Giveaway

=> [Image]( https://i.imgur.com/S4jEVpg.png)

To celebrate Halloween, there will be a “Laughing Gas” Bundle giveaway on the official The Division channels (Discord / Twitter) and participating creators. 

It will also be available in the store. 

&nbsp;

## Special Events

During the season they are also planning further special events. As of now we don’t have specific dates: 

* Winter Event
* More XP Events

More details to follow.

&nbsp;

## Q&A

**Will there be an Apparel Event this Season**

At the moment they are not planning an Apparel Event this Season. The idea is to reward apparel items through other ways – like special events – and not just the grind of an Apparel Event. 

&nbsp;

**Are seasonal characters still a thing**

You can play the Seasonal Journey with a level 1 character, but it is not required. So, you can play with your level 40 character. 

&nbsp;

**More Legendary Missions**

Not planned at the moment, since they were intended for Strongholds only, but maybe down the road. 

&nbsp;

**Extra character slot*

No, that is no longer planned. 

&nbsp;

**Brooklyn DLC Information**

Will be revealed when it is ready. 

&nbsp;

**New Raids / Incursions**

Not planned at this point – but maybe down the road. 

&nbsp;

**New Conflict Map**

Not planned at this point. 

&nbsp;

**Is Faye Lau still alive**

NO

&nbsp;

**Crossplay?**

Not on the table at the moment. 

&nbsp;

**Global Events in Division 1**

They are a small team and they have prioritized Division 2. While some people have been working on it to bring the Global Event back, it is very difficult to make any changes to Division 1 at this point. 

&nbsp;

**Raid Exclusives on Master Difficulty**

Raid exclusive Exotics remain raid exclusive. 

&nbsp;

**Blueprints from old seasons**

The goal is to make them available. 

&nbsp;

**Revisit Descent**

At this point they know what is working with the game mode and what does not, and while they want to revisit Descent, it is not planned in the near future. 

&nbsp;

**Multiple Exotics**

Exotics are balanced so that you can equip only one at a time. When you want to equip multiple Exotics, they have to be nerfed, because you would give you too much power. 

&nbsp;

**Descent Audio Logs**

There will be new collectibles with this season and they are looking into ways to make the old ones accessible. 

&nbsp;

**Monetize backpack trophies and arm patches**

There are no plans to add those to the store, since they were part of those seasons. 

&nbsp;

**Collaborations with other Ubisoft Titles**

They are also in discussions with other Ubisoft titles – not just external partners - what they could do that fit the Division. But no announcement at this point. 

&nbsp;

**New Faction in the game**

A new faction is a lot of work, because it also requires new behavior, new looks and new challenges and that is not in scope at this point. 

&nbsp;

**More Clan Members**

Nothing is planned at this point, but they want to revisit clans. 

&nbsp;

**Gear Mods rework**

They know it is not a good experience.

216,1g18x0t,ileanaki,1728650700.0,Ubisoft Support Ignoring Cheating Reports – Cheater Still Active in Rainbow Six Siege,3,19,"Hey fellow Siege players,

I’m reaching out to the community because I’ve been dealing with an ongoing issue, and Ubisoft Support hasn’t taken any real action to resolve it. I’ve reported a blatant cheater multiple times using the in-game report system, but they’re still active, ruining matches for everyone involved.

Here’s what’s going on:

* **Type of Cheating:** Wallhacking
* **Frequency:** I’ve encountered this player in multiple games, and the cheating is obvious. Despite reporting them through the in-game system, nothing seems to be happening.

I’ve contacted Ubisoft Support multiple times, but I keep getting generic responses telling me to “use the in-game report system” or that they “cannot communicate the outcome of the investigation.” While I understand they can’t share details, the fact that this player is still cheating in plain sight weeks later is incredibly frustrating.

I’ve even posted the player on [reputation.gg](http://reputation.gg) and he already got a reputation ban.

**Has anyone else had a similar experience with reporting cheaters and not seeing any action? How can we, as a community, get Ubisoft to take this seriously?**

I’m considering escalating this issue further and possibly making it more visible on other platforms, but I wanted to see if any of you have suggestions or success stories with getting cheating reports addressed.

Let’s keep Siege fun and fair!

Thanks for any advice or support.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1g18x0t/ubisoft_support_ignoring_cheating_reports_cheater/
217,1g0p9qf,DomFakker37,1728584032.0,I actually love AC: Unity! Sorry (or not?) for being 10 years late.,101,59,"From what I've read, Unity has one of the worst reputations of all the AC games, but if I understand it correctly, the reason for this comes mostly out of the technical issues the game had when it launched back in 2014. I guess I'm glad I did not know anything about the game back then, thus my experience was not ruined.

I just started it recently and the game is amazing! Sure, it gets a little time to get used to, but the visuals are astonishing, the cutscenes are not boring, the story is (despite some small flaws) really good and the missions are rich!

**Visuals:**

The details in faces are almost unbelievable, considering the game came out in 2014. I probably can't name any game that looked that good back in that time except The Witcher or GTA V, which really surprised me. Not only that, the streets of Paris look really good, whether it's the dirty outskirts or the noble houses of the rich people. This is also the first AC game where there is that many pedestrians just randomly doing their stuff and blocking your way. I suppose this is a performance issue, and since this was the first AC released for PS4 (correct me if I'm wrong), I understand that the devs were able to go a step further this time.

**Missions:**

The quests aren't repetitive at all, there was not a single time when I would feel bored. The main story missions are innovative, the side quests are not long, they're simple (that goes to basically every side mission, such as helping your assassin fellows or helping your Social houses etc). I also adore the way the game handles assassinations, it basically gives you multiple options how to enter, how to kill and how to deal with situations. I love that you can simply run at your target and stab them, but you can think your approach through and choose your way of distracting the guards and getting in. There is also not that many tailing missions, which AC series is (mostly negatively) famous for, which I really appreciate.

**Collectibles:**

Another typical AC mechanic (not only, I guess). I remember being tired to death when collecting feathers in Ezio's trilogy. I also hated collecting anything in Connor's game. But Unity? Nothing feels forced. There are chests that have some kind of interaction to it, which is fun. There are cockades that are your typical AC collectible, you usually have to free-run or climb to get them, nothing excessively boring though. And there are side-missions that, as I menitoned, are not long enough to be boring, even though they're sometimes vague thanks to that, so completing them feels good, unlike some previous AC titles.

**Controls:**

They feel clunky when one starts with Unity right after finishing Black Flag and Rogue, and they get some time getting used to, but once you do, the controlled descent is an amazing thing and so is the intentional climbing. I still sometimes jump up instead of jumping down just cause it's not intuitive for me, but I guess I'll learn that. The combat system is not bad at all, even though it's tough for a beginner, who is used to clear fights without even upgrading his weapons, to die after two hits. Not being able to use enemies as Human Shiled and not being able to Whistle is surprising and not a welcome choice, but again, it's not that hard to get used to the new system.

**Coop:**

This is the only thing that I have a problem with, since it seems that [since 30th September, noone has achieved a PS trophy that is strictly linked to coop play](https://psnprofiles.com/trophy/3072-assassins-creed-unity/46-never-say-die). That, sadly, applies to me as well, since I'm unable to connect to anyone, I just get the ""Connection Failed 0x70000006 Error"". And I'm not the only one, many people playing on consoles seem to have the same issue. It seems like the servers are down, even though on Ubisoft's page it says that they're not. I tried going through their PS5 troubleshooting guide and I tried following some random advice from people with similar issue but nothing worked for me. It's a shame, since this is the only thing that prevents me from getting the platinum trophy, but most importantly, I can't enjoy the coop gameplay that I was really looking forward to, especially since I was hoping for something better than that poorly executed multiplayer from Black Flag. I contacted the Ubisoft Support, currently waiting for their reponse, but in case anyone too has this issue, please, let me know.

  
So that's it, that's my post, AC: Unity is awesome and I really hope I'll be able to enjoy 100% of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1g0p9qf/i_actually_love_ac_unity_sorry_or_not_for_being/

",2036,324,"Full list of discounts here: [https://mp1st.com/news/playstation-store-fall-savings-promotion-launches-today-lies-of-p-is-deal-of-the-week](https://mp1st.com/news/playstation-store-fall-savings-promotion-launches-today-lies-of-p-is-deal-of-the-week)

Note: No FromSoftware Games discounted, no Stellar Blade. Not a lot of horror games but that should change soon. Halloween PSN sale should launch Oct. 23.

**PSN Deal of the Week:** [**Lies of P (-40$, $41.99)**](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/eff78812-7d8a-4871-935d-71626db857fe/1)

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

* **NBA 2K25 (-30%, $48.99)** – Literally the only basketball game in town. If you like basketball, the NBA, you pretty much only have this as your lone choice. Not a bad entry, but be prepared for gargantuan patches.
* **Madden NFL 25 (-35%, $45.49)** – Same as with the NBA 2K series, this is the only NFL game on consoles.
* **EA Sports MVP Bundle: Madden NFL 25 + College Football 25 (-25%, $112.49)** – Don’t play football games, but based on reviews, College Football is the superior title. If you’re planning on picking both up, this is the first time it’s on sale.
* **Destiny 2: The Final Shape (-40%, $29.99)** – Doesn’t go on sale often. The latest expansion for Destiny 2.
* **GTA 5 (-50%, $19.99)** – PS4 version is $5 less. This is the lowest it’ll go, so if you’re one of the handful that still doesn’t own this, here’s your chance to line Rockstar’s coffers.
* **Hogwarts Legacy (-70%, $20.99)** – PS4 version is a few bucks less, but this is the version to get. At that price, this should be an impulse buy unless you hate wizards, witches or casting spells. Prepare to make a name for yourself as the youngest wizard with the highest killcount in history.
* **Star Wars Jedi Survivor (-60%, $27.99)** – PS4 version surprisingly costs more. This is the version to get. Souls but with a Jedi flavor. Better than the first one in almost every way, and Cal can run properly here. Third game in development, so this is a good time to get into the franchise.
* **It Takes Two (-75%, $9.99)** – Goes on sale almost every other week. Definitely worth it, but just bear in mind you need a co-op partner to play this,
* **Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered (-50%, $24.99)** – Rarely goes on sale, and this isn’t a bad price at all. If you haven’t played this franchise yet, now might be a good start.
* **Cyberpunk 2077 (-40%, $29.99)** – Rocky launch, but now in a stable state. This is what CDPR envisioned for the game. Definitely worth a buy now.
* **Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC (-15%, $25.49)** – Jampacked with content. If you’re done with the main story, then pick this up.
* **Red Dead Redemption 2(-67%, $19.79)** – Even if you’re not a fan of Westerns, this is still a must-play. Amazing story, gameplay and loads of Easter eggs. Actually prefer this over GTA5.
* **Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart (-58%, $29.39)** – Amazing platformer, loads of weapons to use. Has that rift mechanic that’s only possible on PS5. Give this a shot.
* **Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League (-80%, $13.99)** – The lowest I’ve seen this on PSN. Might be heading to PS Plus soon? It’s worth a try at that price, but depends on how much you like these type of games. Just be mindful that support should be ceasing soon.
* *Mortal Kombat 11 (-50%, $24.99)* – Possibly the lowest I’ve seen it on PSN so far. Your dose of violence, and latest Khaos Reigns content drop was just released and brings Animalities.
* **Avatar Frontiers of Pandora (-50%, $34.99)** – Might be the lowest it’s been on PSN without a bundle. Ubisoft’s formula but with an Avatar coating. Better than expected.
* **Still Wakes the Deep (-33%, $23.44)** – Fairly new. Have this but haven’t started yet. Surprised to see it here this fast.
* **Cuphead (-30%, $13.99)** – DLC is also on sale. Gorgeous visuals, tight controls but hard as hell.
* **F1 24 (-50%, $34.99)** – Latest F1 game from Codemasters. If you’re a fan, then this is a good buy.
* **The Last of Us Part 1 Digital Deluxe (-38%, $49.59)** – Just in case you haven’t played this, still a bit high.
* **WWE 2K24 (-50%, $49.99)** – Free this month for PS+, solid wrestling game and still getting DLCs.
* **Skull and Bones (-60%, $27.99)** – Unsure how well this turned out, but apparently there’s enough players to support its seasonal content.
* **Witcher 3 (-75%, $9.99)** – Super low price, and this is one of my all-time fave games. Fantastic side quests, meaty experience all around. Once you get past the floaty controls/combat, and once it clicks, it’s one hell of an experience. Expansion is also on sale and worth the price.
* **Battlefield 2042 (-$85%, $10.49)** – Worth it at that price. Game is in a much better state now than before.
* **AC Valhalla (-75%, $14.99)** – Assassin’s Creed Vikings! Insane amount of content, though overstays its welcome a bit.
* **Borderlands 3 (-90%, $5.99)** – Looter shooter but not live service. Insane action, and a steal at that price.
* **Earth Defense Force 6 (-20%, $47.99)** – If you dig these types of games, might be worth a pickup.
* **The Outlast Trials (-33%, $33.49)** – Multiplayer-focused horror game. Still getting lots of support.
* **GTA The Trilogy (-50%, $29.99)** – Unsure how performance is nowadays. Three games in one in case you want more GTA gaming before GTA6 drops.
* **Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy (-60%, $15.99)** – Crash platforming. Harder than it looks.
* **Mafia Trilogy (-75%, $14.99)** – Three Mafia games in one. Definitely not a bad deal, and there’s a new one on the way.
* **Star Wars Battlefront 2 (-70%, $5.99)** – Definitely worth the price. No content support incoming, but servers still up and someone said here previously that there’s no shortage of players. Fun to smash people around playing as your favorite Star Wars character.
* **LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga (-75%, $14.99)** – Star Wars adventure with Lego humor. Fun to play with kids or your partner.
* **Payday 3 (-60%, $15.99)** – Lowest I’ve seen this on PSN. Not sure if worth it now, but still getting loads of support.
* **Horizon Burning Shores (-50%, $9.99)** – First time I’ve seen this on sale. In case you want more for the game, then this DLC should scratch that itch.
* **Powerwash Simulator (-30%, $17.49)** – Doesn’t go on sale often. Surprisingly fun and getting regular support.
* **Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order (-75%, $9.99)** – If you’re planning on playing the trilogy, then this is your starting point. Lots of backtracking and Cal runs like he has crap in his pants that will never be OK.
* **Dead by Daylight Gold Edition (-40%,$41.99)** – Heavily supported, and DLCs are also on sale. Asymmetrical horror game for those who want something different.
* **Metro Saga Bundle (-85%, $8.99)** – Three games from the Metro franchise at a discounted rate.
* **Far Cry 6 (-75%, $14.99)** – Solid first-person campaign, and stars Giancarlo Esposito as the baddie.
* **Detroit Become Human (-50%, $9.99)** – More of an interactive movie than a game, but still solid. If you haven’t played Quantic’s games, it’s like Supermassive’s titles.
* **Midnight Suns (-75%, $17.49)** – Strategy with Marvel characters. Surprisingly fun even without MCU likenesses, and has solid length and depth.
* **Pacific Drive (-40%, $17.99)** – First-person driving survival game that’s still getting a lot of support.
* **Divinity Original Sin 2 (-65%, $20.99)** – Larian’s breakout hit. If you want your RPGs deep and long.
* **Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition (-20%, $15.99) –** First time this is on sale. If you ever wanted to play the cult classic, then this is the newest way of doing so. You might finish it in time for the sequel which should be coming any day now…
* **Persona 3 Reload Digital Deluxe Edition (-40%, $47.99) –** If you’re looking to play Persona 3, then this is it. Just got it last DLC drop this September as well.
* **System Shock (-40%, $23.99)** – Remake of a classic. SHODAN!
* **For Honor (-85%, $4.49)** – Multiplayer action game but more melee focused. Still getting loads of support after all these years.
* **Flintlock Siege of Dawn (-25%, $29.99)** – AA action game that didn’t sell well. Might be worth a look? Surely will go down in price more in a few months though.
* **Sifu (-60%, $15.99)** – Beat-’em-up but with more modern mechanics. Neat aging system for life, and harder than expected. Fun when you know what you’re doing.
* **Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 Turbocharged (-75%, $12.49)** -Still getting support. If you like your racing games more arcade-y than sim.
* **Hi-Fi Rush (-40%, $17.99)** – Tango’s last game before leaving Microsoft. JP style action-adventure. GOTY contender as well.
* **Mass Effect Legendary Edition (-85%, $8.99)** – Will never not recommend this. Probably my fave RPG trilogy of all-time. You can get your money’s worth with just the first game, but to have your decisions carry over until the last one? Yean, BioWare at their peak!
* **LA Noire (-50%, $19.99)** – Still priced high for an old game. Amazing visuals and makes you feel like a detective.
* **Back 4 Blood (-90%, $5.99)** – Support has ended but still fun if you can round up friends for co-op.
* **Need for Speed Unbound (-85%, $10.49)** – Still getting support somewhat. Arcade racing and has a less serious take on the franchise. Controls feel a bit floaty for me.
* **Banishers Ghosts of New Eden (-30%, $41.99)** – Criminally underrated game. Not AAA, but certain aspects of it do feel AAA. Combat is ists weakest link but it has a lot of content, good story and loads of secrets.
* **Tomb Raider I-III Remastered (-50%, $14.99)** – The old Tomb Raider games but with added sheen. Prepare for pixelated Lara and lots of mindless jumping while shooting.
* **Gotham Knights (-80%, $13.99)** – Underperformed but still fun. At that price, might be worth jumping into it just to test out the combos you can pull off since each character has their own moveset.
* **Lords of the Fallen (-50%, $34.99)** – The reboot. Sequel is in development and the studio pushed out a ton of new features and whatnot.
* **Crash Bandicoot Bundle: N. Sane Trilogy + CTR Nitro-Fueled (-65%, $26.24) –** Crash overload! Platforming and kart racing in a bundle.
* **Titanfall 2 (-75%, $4.99)** – One of the best FPS’ ever made. Play the campaign and jump into the multiplayer to get melted by sweats.
* **Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes (-35%, $32.49)** – Old-school RPG that surprisingly sold and reviewed well. Still getting support and this is the first time it’s on sale on PSN if I’m not mistaken.
* **Shadow of the Tomb Raider (-80%, $3.99)** – Didn’t finish it, but it’s a solid third-person action game. At that price? Yeah, definitely worth a shot.
* **Alone in the Dark (-30%, $41.99)** – Nota successful remake, but not a bad one either. It’s OK. Combat is nothing special and graphics won’t blow anyone away. Ambience is fine, and worth a look for horror fans.
* **A Plague Tale Bundle (-60%, $31.99)** – Don’t play if you get scared of rats, but this is a solid two games and story is well done.
* **Control – (-80%, $7.99)** – Remedy’s pure action game. In the same universe as Alan Wake. This includes the DLCs as well.
* **Hell Let Loose (-40%, $35.99)** – Era multiplayer FPS that’s still getting a lot of support from the devs.
* **The Division 2 Ultimate (-75%, $14.99)** – Fun especially with friends. Includes Warlords of NY expansion. Still getting support and getting new story DLC next year.
* **The Order 1886 (-50%, $9.99)** – Super short but sweet. Loved this when it was released. Amazing visuals then. Shame we won’t see what happens to the tale.
* **Evil West (-60%, $23.99)** – Vampire action game. AA fare but not bad at all. Expect jank and some unpolished visuals but could do worse than this.
* **Cult of the Lamb Cultist Edition (-50%, $14.99)** – Still getting supported. Fun and surprisingly deep. Who knew it was so much fun to have your own cult.
* **Nioh Collection (-58%, $29.39) –** Team Nnja’s Souls game. Hard as nails though, but lots of fans swear how good these games are.
* **Tomb Raider Definitive (-80%, $3.99)** – The first game in the new Tomb Raider trilogy. Solid action games.

1) community is full of shit, literally anytime I give callouts in the mic disaster strucks. This includes:
-Guys shouting ""WOMAN?!"" in the mic all game
-Sexists comments 
-Rape threats

2)Game doesn't run on linux, the reason I already had a break from this game after thunderbird's release up to release of Deimos, windows nowadays just sucks, yet ubisoft are not willing to turn on linux support besides it taking no effort at all these days. Their reasoning are cheater problems, but most players know, that despite no linux support, this game is already infested with cheaters to the point where every second high-rank match someone is cheating. So yeah, cheaters don't need linux.

3) cheater problem, see the prior point.

4) devs generally don't listen to the community, most balance changes are bs and literally noone was asking for them

That's really unfortunate, game is still one of the better shooters and can be fun, but I got too fed up, there's too much shit being thrown at you, so it really isn't worth it sticking to it for some fun once in a while, honestly hope your experience is different, but until linux support, better anticheat and better moderation tools, I won't go back to this game, see yall in tf2 and dbd",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1fxtvyp/a_month_ago_i_completely_abandoned_siege_after/
220,1fy3yj7,pyrofire95,1728295040.0,It's so exhausting talking to people about AC outside of this sub. (Series appreciation and thoughtfully written ramble),54,148,"Firstly Thank you everyone here for being respectful and reasonable humans.  
We all have our reasons for being here and appreciation for these games, what they've been and what they can be.  
What they've given us and the hours they've taken.  
Within the vastness of this illusory world of the internet there is a blanketed and ignorant view of what these games are and what they should be, the grand majority of the time falsely informed by a misunderstanding of what these games achieve as well as simply what they are, what makes them Assassin's Creed games.  
It seems to me that many gamers do not know that they just might not like something and instead of peacefully going on to something they do enjoy, they put effort into poorly barking vague demands of what AC games should do. They do this without points of specific critique and no offers of solution.  
The past sins of Ubisoft have blinded denizens to the great lengths and strides the series has made and accomplished.  
  
Thousands of people around the world have been pressed into the machine to put these games out as consistently has they have been, and in putting these peoples life force into them they have been able to iterate, experiment, and expand what these games can be, what it looks like to be an AC game. No two games are completely alike. The cost of this frequent iteration is the appearance of stagnation but small iteration over a decade makes any two games that far apart look very different. Other franchises might take 8 years to create a follow up and for that have an appearance of a great change. It's all perspective but it's all the same change, but the greater frequency has the added benefit for more iteration, more feedback, less risk for trying something new, so each AC game has.  
I haven't put to paper exactly what I believe to be the pillars of the series is but quickly, an offer of what they might be.

1. Immersion into a place and time.
2. Strongly Characterized Protagonist who is driven yet conflicted and challenged
3. Unending struggle between Freedom and Control

Historical accuracy is NOT a pillar of this series, never has been, and never stated so. It state before each game this is a work of fiction. They promote these games with the tagline ""History is our playground"" There is dialog in the first game stating that what is seen in the animus is the ""real"" past (if the simulation hasn't already been altered by Abstergo.) The games are the ""truth"" behind grand conspiracy.  
Any inaccuracies are not wrong, they are true within the games.  
It doesn't matter what Yasuke really did IRL, within the context of Shadows this is the secret life he did live.

Assassin's Creed is a modern marvel in my eyes. The technical achievement of realizing these moments in human history and allowing anyone to explore in that setting is truly something special and something you can observe being the target from the first game and improving ever since. That's why going to these REALLY massive open worlds kind of needed to happen, there's just some settings that need that scale to really feel out. Odyssey really plays right by it's name. The player goes on a truly massive journey and sees so much happen in the MCs life, so for me it really feels like coming home when I retired that game by traveling back to Kassandra's home, saving and quitting there. (then the vacation episode released)  
Ubisoft was on high with the Ezio trilogy. He was their mascot, the games were wildly successful and pretty much void of the baggage of today. And they did something cool with Ezio. They let him grow up, and they let Ezio die. A fan can follow Ezio's life LITERALLY from the moment he emerges from his mothers birth canal until he takes his dying breath.  
  
That is just incredible, magical, something heavy, and felt.  
\[next paragraph kinda spoils a scene at the end of AC Revelations\]  
Ezio's monologue when he finds Altairs corpse in Revelations is one of the most beautiful scenes ever put to screen for all that it carries. Working the whole game to unseal a vault of untold value. He only finds little more than the remains of Altair, then Ezio pays his respects to a brother he has never really met. Then in this powerful scene where Ezio has a flicker of memory the name Desmond reaches his mind. Ezio admits there is something much bigger than himself happening as he admits he doesn't understand how but knows that Desmond is listening, he acknowledges that he's realized that he's only a messenger after spending his whole life chasing something with a drive he couldn't explain. But without bitterness on that fact he only appreciates the beauty in it and says, ""Who are we, who have been so blessed to share our stories like this? To speak across centuries?"" GAH DAYUM.

Yes there are entries that I kinda hate, but I still love them.

What moments are really cool or special to you? Be they be a scene that resonates strongly or a moment you have tied to the games.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1fy3yj7/its_so_exhausting_talking_to_people_about_ac/

222,1fxlffo,adtrix101,1728234636.0,Make ranked great again!,2,2,"So, I posted some feedback on the Ubisoft Discord about matchmaking, win/loss streaks, and rank progression in Rainbow Six Siege, and Ubi-Ineradicable suggested I bring the discussion here on Reddit to get more input. So, here we are!

A bit of background: I’ve been playing since the beta, both on console and PC. Lately, it feels like ranked has been getting worse over time, so I finally decided to sit down and figure out what the main issues are and how they could be fixed. I know a lot of people in the community feel the same way, and I thought it’d be good to talk about it here. Let’s hear your thoughts!

I’ve been playing Rainbow Six Siege for quite a while now, and I wanted to share some thoughts about the current Ranked 2.0 system, specifically with matchmaking, win/loss streaks, and how ranks are progressing. I think the changes made were a step in the right direction, but after playing a bunch of ranked matches, there are a few things that don’t feel quite right. I figured I’d share my feedback along with some suggestions.

1. Matchmaking Balance Feels Off

One of the main issues I’ve noticed is that matchmaking often doesn’t feel fair. Even though the system separates MMR from Rank Points, there are huge discrepancies in player skill levels within matches. For example, we were in a match where a Champion 1 player with a 1.8 K/D and 7.8 kills per match was on the same team as a Silver 5 player with a 0.4 K/D and 1.9 kills per match. It makes no sense why these players would even be in the same bracket, let alone the same match. This kind of imbalance often leads to one-sided games, and the players involved don’t get a fair or competitive experience.

The idea behind MMR is great, but it seems like there’s a disconnect between visible ranks and the actual skill level of players. Lower-ranked players like Copper/Bronze are having to fight way above their level, while higher-ranked players get easy wins.

Suggestion:

It would help if matchmaking was stricter in pairing players based on their win/loss ratios and K/D stats. This could make the games more competitive and enjoyable for everyone. Players with much higher hidden MMR than their current rank should be boosted faster to where they belong instead of staying in lower ranks for multiple games.

2. Win/Loss Streaks Aren’t Rewarding Enough

The way win/loss streaks affect rank progression feels unbalanced. For example, we went on a 9-game win streak, starting at 39 rank points per win, but by the end of the streak, we were only getting 40 rank points. Then, after one loss, our rank points dropped back to 39, followed by a 3-game win streak that stayed at 39 rank points. After another loss, our rank points fell further to 37. It feels like losses are punished much more than wins are rewarded, making progression feel slow and frustrating.

Suggestion:

Introducing a win streak bonus where consecutive wins are rewarded with extra Rank Points would make progression feel more rewarding. This would help counterbalance the frustration of losing rank after just a few bad games, especially when players are putting in consistent performances.

3. ""Ranked 2.0 is Better than 1.0 Because Matches End in Overtime"" Argument

During the announcement of Ranked 2.0, Ubisoft developers mentioned that more matches are now ending in overtime, which was used as a justification for why the new system is more balanced and competitive. However, while teams may appear to be better matched overall, there’s still a huge imbalance within the teams themselves. For example, in the match mentioned earlier, the Champion 1 player with a 1.8 K/D and 7.8 kills per match dominated, while the Silver 5 player with a 0.4 K/D and 1.9 kills per match struggled to keep up. This kind of disparity between top and bottom fraggers happens across both teams, making the ""more matches go to overtime"" argument feel misleading.

Just because a match ends in overtime doesn’t mean it’s balanced. Often, one or two players carry the team, and the others struggle to keep up, which doesn’t reflect a truly competitive or balanced experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1fxlffo/make_ranked_great_again/

The addition of the Descent game mode and ""new"" content with the changes to seasons adding modifiers etc. etc. etc. has broken me. All I have ever wanted from the developers of this game is additional maps (Cities) with NEW missions and more legendary content. How about Chicago as a DLC? Miami and Los Angeles have been done to death with other games. The addition of ""expertise"" I managed to tolerate until now with the major grind to upgrade my weapons and gear...however there has been a corresponding ""balancing"" of NPC characteristics which has made the expertise system pretty much pointless. The Devs continue to talk balancing. It's like employers talking ""flexibility""...all their way! So I now can virtually never find others online to run Tidal Basin or Manning Zoo Legendary missions. These are a challenge indeed and I have completed them several times with a good group. However the rewards are lousy. Should be able to get minimum 3 exotic components for successful completion. I could go on but gets boring.

224,1fu4ony,RareSnake89,1727832379.0,How to enjoy the Prince of Persia Sands of Time trilogy for PC in 2024 (fixes and tweaks that make the experience almost like PS2 vanilla),19,3,"The Prince of Persia Sands of Time trilogy was made in early-to-mid 2000's, so, these games need some specific fixes and tweaks to run decently on modern hardware.

**Fix the game launcher:**  
Regedit @ ""Computer\\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Ubisoft\\\[game name\]\\\[version\]""

* Add or Edit parameter ""llang"" (value = ""EN"" for English. I haven't tested another language. This parameter is optional in some of these games, you may not need to add/edit it)
* Add or Edit parameter ""Product\_Executable"" (value = ""PrinceOfPersia.exe"")
* Add or Edit parameter ""Product\_Path"" (value = Full path of the game's root folder)
* Add or Edit parameter ""Profiles\_Path"" (value = Full path of the save folder. I personally set it to the game's root folder)

**Fix resolution:**  
Use Universal Widescreen (UniWS) Patcher:  
[https://www.wsgf.org/article/universal-widescreen-uniws-patcher](https://www.wsgf.org/article/universal-widescreen-uniws-patcher)  
It works fine with 1920x1080px, but it didn't work for 3440x1440px.  
Then select the new resolution in-game.

**Fix some settings for DirectX 9, Fog and UI Stretching:**  
I included a working ""Hardware.INI"" file for each of these games.

**Fix the physics bugs related to FPS:**  
The games physics bug at 60FPS and more.  
Ex: in Warrior Within, in the Water Tower Garden, we are supposed to climb a structure, but the prince can't wall run it vertically or does but doesn't grab onto the top.

* Limit FPS for POP/POP2/POP3.EXE in nVidia Control Panel to 30-59
* Set screen refresh rate to 60Hz (if you need to)
* Set V-Sync ON/OFF in-game after testing which works best for you

Since the games were released in the PS2 days, I set FPS to 30.

**Setup your controllers manually in-game:**

* Sands of Time and Warrior Within work fine with Xbox controllers, whether real or virtual device (I tested DS4Windows but x360ce v4 should be fine too. x360ce v3 didn't work neither with my DualShock4 nor my generic controller)
* The Two Thrones doesn't work well with Xbox controllers, prefer a generic controller without x360ce

**Get better colors:**  
Use ReShade:  
[https://reshade.me/](https://reshade.me/)  
I included 2 presets (.INI files), one for SoT & T2T, and another for WW.

You can download my config (zipped .INI files) here:

You should now have an acceptable gaming experience playing or replaying these great classics.

* I checked a lot of YouTube videos during my search, but the most important one is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaCXGVMFh4Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaCXGVMFh4Y)
* The hint about high FPS breaking the physics, I read in forums somewhere while searching.
* I tested a few Remaster Mods but they broke the games, they inject textures at runtime but since I have the Ubisoft Connect version, the games executables POP/POP2/POP3.EXE don't work directly, you have to launch the games through PrinceOfPersia.EXE, and setting up the injector to target these launchers causes crashes 2 out of 3 times, so the games usually play in Safe Mode, and the textures and models look buggy in-game.

trailer link: [https://youtu.be/FcMRkyoHKeA?si=1sWaGW8muzPbXS22](https://youtu.be/FcMRkyoHKeA?si=1sWaGW8muzPbXS22)

When I watched the trailer, I couldn't believe what I was seeing in reality, and I was impatiently waiting for the game, and of course, in the end we all know what happened.

Sometimes I would say to myself everything that was shown at E3  
it was just a lie, or just a fake video that was recorded and shown only, and that game does not exist in the first place, but I am wrong. 

You can find another video on the Ubisoft channel

link: [https://youtu.be/7JcujYbctPk?si=DcpSh4NkOz9H2IlM](https://youtu.be/7JcujYbctPk?si=DcpSh4NkOz9H2IlM)

which shows one of the development team trying out the game in front of the audience, and it was very clear that the gameplay was different compared to the other video above.

This means that that copy of the game already exists and is hidden somewhere and no one knows where it is. I'm really sad that we can't get that version, even if we did get that short demo, we might have been able to take advantage of it and integrate it with the original game.

There are some people who tried to work on the game to make it resemble a trailer, but unfortunately, even despite all these efforts, it is very difficult to approach it.

It's been almost 12 years since this happened, and I still go and watch that trailer, which really blows my mind every time, even though it's 2024, but it was really ahead of its time. I'm not saying that the game in the latest version was bad, on the contrary I actually liked it, but if the experience had been as it appeared in the trailer, it would have been the same. It will be completely different.

Unfortunately, we can do nothing but hope that Ubisoft will remake this game for this generation.

Well, that game's one year anniversary is on November 16th, 42 days after Mirage's! And while I doubt if they will do anything for Nexus as it is simply a small spinoff game, it is one of the best games Ubisoft have ever made since the release of Black Flag! A microtransactionless, fully complete experience that launched almost without a single bug to an audience that widely accepted the game to be good! Of course there were complaints that it's combat system was sub-par, but it was designed with stealth in mind so that is fine!

Never have I had such a shady and trash experience than I did with 2K games.

I bought NBA 2k17 sometime in 2018 and I LOVED it. I was lost in that game for months with my friends. We spent hundreds of hours leveling and putting work into our characters to get them all the badges and everything to make them top notch.

Then after those characters were good to go we spent 100$ each to boost new characters.

We also spent a decent chunk of money on the card system. You could play games with the characters attached to your cards, it was really cool, and the cards had rarities so that made it even more fun when you found those amazing ruby or emerald cards... So fun!

Then it happened. NBA 2k19 came out and they announced they would be shutting down 2k17 servers. You couldn't transfer anything. You lost all your cards(Aren't cards supposed to be collectible items? wtf?) Your characters were gone... The only thing you could now do in this game was play straight up team vs team basketball which if I was gonna do that I'd just go play NBA Jam for the Sega Genesis... I want The Park... I want my card team. But nope. It's gone...

Every time a new NBA game comes out they just scrap all your work and anything you've spent money on from the game 2 years prior. It's honestly thievery at its finest.

Imagine buying something and just TWO years later it's gone and you can't play it anymore.

I honestly can't believe I never see 2K games get put on blast for this shitty terrible behavior, but it's no better than what ubisoft is doing these days, so I'm letting people know.

I've played unity, syndicate, origins, Odyssey and Valhalla. Origins being my favorite in the recent Ancient civilization games.

Also played all the watch dogs games. But I can't keep playing Ubisoft games anymore.

Even with heavy discount, they feel like such a chore with the insane grinding. Valhalla broke me, so much grinding and so boring. At one point I stopped having fun and I gave up on the game, WD legion too felt so stale and not fun to play, I finished it but I'll never play it again. WD 2 was so fun.

Now it just feels like Ubisoft is pumping out games just to reach a certain financial goal. They stopped innovating the gameplay and now every single IP feels like same game with a different coat of paint.

Every game has the same stealth mechanic. Every game is monetized our of the ass. Even for AC which is now primarily a RPG series. The fun of RPG is not even present properly, in an RPG I want to feel immersed with various different branches, endings, ways to play which incentives multiple play throughs but after finishing an AC game I feel drained and don't want to play it again. It doesn't give me any reason for me to play again.

Where as CDPR even cyberpunk, I would play again, with different endings, different builds, different relationships. At the very least because the gameplay loop is engaging, I don't have to grind for hours. Same for the witcher, even though they are 2 different IPs and both being RPGs, they are different experiences. The DLC expands and innovates on the base game too.

Sucker Punch has very diverse IPs from Sly cooper which is a platformer stealth to infamous which is a pure open world power fantasy to the Ghost series.

In conclusion, I'm done with Ubisoft now until I see a actual effort to innovate in their games.

P.S. Imo since Origins came out, the AAA games quality bar has reached so high to where Ubisoft simply can't compete anymore. We have bangers every year like elden ring, God of War, Baldur's Gate, RDR 2, Alan Wake and all these games take time to cook, meanwhile Ubisoft out here pumping out new AC games on a pretty much yearly basis with same old formula like a making new iPhones with minimal new upgrades borrowed from other games but doesn't improve on it and I don't think Ubisoft understands why the games I mentioned and the features they borrow from other games were actually so popular and hits with the gamers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fscd1h/after_years_of_playing_ubisoft_games_i_gave_up_on/

# 1. Nostalgia for Longtime Players

Many veteran players have fond memories of the original House, as it was one of the most iconic and popular maps in *Rainbow Six Siege* from its early days. Reintroducing the map in custom games would cater to those nostalgic for the simpler times when House was one of the primary battlegrounds. This could create a bridge between old and new players, celebrating the map that helped shape the Siege community.

# 2. Variety in Custom Games

Custom games in *Rainbow Six Siege* thrive on offering diverse experiences, and bringing back the old House map would expand the pool of maps available for personalized matches. Custom matches are often used for fun, training, or community tournaments, and the original House, with its smaller and more simplistic design, could offer a different pacing compared to the reworked version. This map could be especially fun for more casual, laid-back play sessions.

# 3. Simplicity of the Layout

The original House had a very straightforward layout, which made it a perfect map for beginners to learn the game’s mechanics and operators. This simplicity can be contrasted with the complexity of the reworked version or other maps that can be difficult for new players to master. Bringing back the old map in customs would allow players to revisit a map with fewer angles, and tight, close-quarters combat, making for some fun, fast-paced gameplay.

# 4. Customization and Operator Testing

Custom games are often used to test operator strategies and practice skills, and the original House would provide a good environment for testing. Its small size and minimal vertical gameplay would allow players to focus on raw mechanical skills, operator gadgets, and interactions. For example, the map's smaller scale is perfect for fast rounds and 1v1 or 2v2 scenarios where tactics and reflexes are emphasized over complex strategies.

# 5. Balancing Concerns Are Minimized

One of the reasons old House was reworked was due to balancing issues in ranked play, as the map was seen as too attacker-favored and small for serious competitive play. However, in a custom game setting, where the stakes are lower, these balancing concerns are less important. Players in custom matches typically experiment with unorthodox strategies and operators, and the old House would allow for chaotic, fast, and fun matches that don't necessarily have to be balanced perfectly.

# 6. Community Events and Creative Use

Streamers, YouTubers, and other content creators love making unique events or game modes in Siege, and old House could serve as a backdrop for those events. From hostage rescues to custom deathmatches, the original House would be ideal for creative community-led gameplay, where fun is prioritized over competitive balance.

# 7. Ease of Implementation

Given that Ubisoft already has the assets for the original House (from before the rework), reintroducing it into custom games wouldn't require the same level of development effort as creating a brand-new map. It’s more about enabling access rather than building from scratch, which makes it a feasible and potentially low-effort addition.1. Nostalgia for Longtime PlayersMany veteran players have fond memories of the original House, as it was one of the most iconic and popular maps in Rainbow Six Siege from its early days. Reintroducing the map in custom games would cater to those nostalgic for the simpler times when House was one of the primary battlegrounds. This could create a bridge between old and new players, celebrating the map that helped shape the Siege community.2. Variety in Custom GamesCustom games in Rainbow Six Siege thrive on offering diverse experiences, and bringing back the old House map would expand the pool of maps available for personalized matches. Custom matches are often used for fun, training, or community tournaments, and the original House, with its smaller and more simplistic design, could offer a different pacing compared to the reworked version. This map could be especially fun for more casual, laid-back play sessions.3.

## Season 2.0

Seasons were introduced to The Division 2 in March 2020 with the release of Warlords of New York. They have become a key aspect of the endgame, however, after four years, this model has reached its limit. To prepare for the game's future, they needed to reevaluate the season model, update it, and equip the game with the right tools to make each season truly unique. 

TU 22 & Seasons 2.0 offers an exciting mix of new gameplay elements, new story, and rewards, all presented in a fresh way that allows for greater creativity and surprise. The main idea behind Seasons 2.0 is to break away from the current seasonal model by transforming the entire experience. 

&nbsp;

### Seasonal Journey Missions

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season’s content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

### Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

&nbsp;

### Manhunt Scouts

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

&nbsp;

### Seasonal Modifiers

=> [Season Modifiers]( https://i.imgur.com/XfduRhn.png)

The Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience.

The modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges.

&nbsp;

###Season Pass 

The optional Season Pass is available for all The Division 2 players starting at Level 1, priced at 1000 Premium Credits ($9.99 or your regional equivalent) in the in-game store and does not require ownership of the Warlords of New York DLC. While accessible from Level 1, please note that the rewards remain locked until Level 40.

Additionally, players can opt for the Premium+ option, available for 3000 Premium Credits ($29.99 or your regional equivalent), which bundles the Premium Season Pass with multiple rewards, offering even greater value.

&nbsp;

=> [SeasonPass]( https://i.imgur.com/BurFjAY.png)

&nbsp;

Players with the Season Pass can gain access to the following premium track rewards: 

*   10 gear dyes
*   10 weapon skins 
*   2 outfits 
*   2 new Prestige Arm Patches

&nbsp;

Moreover, players can earn 400 Virtual Currency by progressing through the Season Pass on the premium track.

But that's not all! Free players now can receive cosmetics in the Season Pass. The free track includes 1 outfit and 1 weapon skin, allowing every Agent to gear up and stand out in the streets of D.C.

##Balancing Pass

###Rework

**Sledgehammer** - Weapon Talent

Dealing damage with a grenade applies a mark on target. Targets with marks will take **15%(20%) more damage to armor** and have a -20% movement speed. Mark disappears after 10 seconds.  
  
_Previously: Dealing damage with a grenade applies a mark on target. Targets with marks will take 30% more damage to armor and have a -20% movement speed. Mark disappears after 10 seconds._

&nbsp;  

**Mosquito Song** - Exotic Pistol

Hitting an enemy applies a stack. Stacks are shared between players. At **5** stacks, the enemy will forcefully target the last player to apply a stack for 5s **and take 25% more damage to armor**. Stacks deplete every 5s. Activating the effect on an enemy will remove all stacks from other enemies.

&nbsp;

### Balancing - Weapons & Talents, Gear & Brand Sets, Exotic Weapons & Gear

With the introduction of Seasons 2.0, which brings new features like Modifiers, Scouts, Priority Objectives and the Seasonal Journey, we’ve taken a fresh approach to balancing, aiming to give different playstyles more distinct personalities.

This update will address a wide range of elements, including various weapon categories, Exotic weapons and gear, weapon mods, talents, and gear sets.

&nbsp;

### Loot Pool Update

In TU22, a fresh batch of Named Weapons will be added to the loot pool for missions and mission bosses. While the original loot tables remain unchanged, they now offer additional opportunities to obtain these new items.

Although these weapons have a higher drop rate, they are not guaranteed rewards and may require multiple attempts to acquire. The likelihood of these weapons dropping increases with the difficulty level of the mission.

These new loot drop chances are exclusively available for characters at level 40 or above and are limited to regular versions of missions - they do not apply to ""invaded"" missions.

#Shades of Red

Year 6 Season 2: Shades of Red is marking the start of a new seasonal journey. With Aaron Keener in custody at the White House, he aims to strike a deal with The Division. Before Agents can learn what he knows, they have to secure the other members of Keener's team, starting with Theo Parnell.

##SEASONS 2.0

###Seasonal Journey

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season's content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

###Seasonal Modifiers

=> [Season Modifiers]( https://i.imgur.com/XfduRhn.png)

The Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience: 

*   **Global Modifiers** set the overall theme of the season and are active at all times while the system is enabled, affecting the core gameplay loop. 
    *   This season, the theme is ""range."" The Global Modifier, ""Point Blank,"" grants a bonus damage based on distance from enemies. 
*   **Active Modifiers** function like ""ultimate"" abilities, giving your character a short burst of power. 
    *   Players can choose from a selection of Active Modifiers, but only one can be equipped at a time. This season, they manipulate the range zones set by the Global Modifier. 
*   **Passive Modifiers** work in conjunction with the Global Modifier, adding extra bonuses. 
    *   Players can equip up to three Passive Modifiers simultaneously. In the first season, these modifiers provide additional benefits based on the range zones from the Global Modifier. 
*   **Hostile Modifiers:** These represent how the enemies adapt to your new abilities. 
    *   As players progress through the season, enemies will gradually gain new abilities linked to specific enemy types, forcing you to use the Global, Passive, and Active Modifiers strategically to counter them. 

The modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges. 

&nbsp;

###Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

Players can choose from three objectives, selecting one based on limited information such as duration, reward category, and mission type. Once a selection is made, it is locked in, and the full details of the objective and its rewards will be revealed.

If none of the objectives appeal to the player, the system allows for rerolls and has an Abandon Objective feature. Players can earn reroll points by completing Priority Objectives, with a maximum of three rerolls stored at any time.

There is no limit to the number of Priority Objectives a player can complete, and rewards include XP, Season Pass XP, items, resources, and passive modifier unlocks.  

&nbsp;

###Manhunt Scouts

=> [Parnell Manhunt](https://i.imgur.com/khEGjlR.jpeg)

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

Each week, players can tackle a Scout, which consists of three different activities. These activities will vary, and players must solve a small riddle to complete each one. Activities should be completed in order, and once all three are finished, players will receive the Scout Reward.

Once all activities in a Scout are completed, players will receive a bigger reward, including a unique collectible. However, new Scouts cannot be accessed until the current one is completed.

By the end of the season, completing all Scouts unlocks the Manhunt Climax Mission, and finishing that unlocks the Master Climax Mission, so make sure to stay on track each week.

&nbsp;

##GEAR, WEAPONS & TALENTS

This season introduces two new Named Weapons and several new Talents, along with a new Gear Set and Brand Set. Exotic collectors can look forward to a new Exotic Assault Rifle, an Exotic Holster, and an exclusive Exotic Chest Piece awarded for completing the Climax Mission.

236,1femo0o,InbrainInTheMemsain,1726092664.0,Why is this game so bad?,6,0,"One of my biggest issues with Siege is that, we are in Year 9, more than half way through at this point. 

I am gonna bitch a bit, but there is a tl;dr if you wanna skip.

Is anyone else troubled by the lack of polish this game has? There's so much little issues and problems, consistent audio issues, a new invisible glitch, the new character constantly T-Poses on spawn, there's been massive hit-reg issues lately, consistent visual/had issues. PC removed Vulkan and the game is basically a stuttery mess right now. They significantly cut down on adding new content to make fixes which have not come, any events have been reused, with recycled and recolored skins. 

They confirmed being able to detect MnK on console but won't do anything about it and mousetrap is ridiculously easy to get around by design. On PC, cheaters will literally run streams, ""Day 89 of R6 while blatantly cheating"" and laugh because it's funny to them how bad the anti-cheat is. On both, you'll have people with ridiculously bloated w/l or k/d ratios which you can definitely use to fairly reliably locate both smurfs and cheaters, you'll have players whose account names are literally ""I am cheating at this game, but Ubisoft won't do shit"" while they blatantly cheat and Ubisoft will ""no idea how to find cheaters, *shrug*."" 

I get the MnK/Cheater situation isn't specific just to R6, it's a huge issue with gaming in general, but Ubisoft has such a bad approach to this it demands being called out.

My biggest thing is, the game lacks any refinement with its changes too. Anyone with half a brain can tell you a lot of the changes they make to the game make no sense. Ubisoft will constantly shoot themselves in the foot time and time and time again because they have no idea how to balance their operators properly. For example, Ash is over-picked, slightly over-performing, what do we do? Nerf the R4-C? Okay, but that will now also negatively affect Ram, who is pretty balanced as far as ops go, and Ram doesn't need any nerfs/buffs at this point. Maybe nerf Ash's gadget or speed? Nah, just take 5 bullets away from both of them. 

One of the biggest issues is nerfing an operator based off of just presence alone. With the exception of Jager, who has received several merciless kicks to the dick, changing an operator based off of their over-appearance in matches is just a stupid idea, especially if they're not over-performing by any large means. On both Console and PC, Ash is the most picked attacker, but has a relatively low success rate for such a picked character, whereas someone like Sens, on both Console and PC is by far the worst attacker based on both win and presence %. For all intents and purposes, I'd understand a massively underpicked/under-performing operator needing more attention than an overpicked but not exactly stellar performing op.

This is absolutely just my takes on a few things, I'm a huge fan of the game but damn dude, shit sucks. All that Ubisoft is doing is finding more and more ways to monetize the game while the devs fail to deliver on promised changes, the game remains broken, but hey, don't forget there's some nice perks for the membership.

Tl;dr
The game is over nine fucking years old, why does it feel like a just off early access mess when it's the big game basically keeping Ubisoft off the ground. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1femo0o/why_is_this_game_so_bad/

Ubisoft really need to do something here, for older games especially it’s not very pro-consumer. I don’t want to have to open up and login to another launcher for a game that is no longer supported. I just want to play the damn game.

The game runs amazingly on the deck, but it’s a shame to see older titles be plagued with dumb crap like this. The Deck has made handheld gaming feel, honestly, amazing! But 3rd party launchers for games you’ve purchased *on steam* adds a roadblock to that otherwise seamless experience. Please, consider seperating your older, unsupported titles from the launcher, or at least stop this logging in every time you launch an old title thing, it’s so abhorrently infuriating.

238,1f1w8sr,Status-Bug7380,1724698762.0,Playing every assassin's creed games (part 2),3,0,"Assassin's creed liberation was very interesting, I liked this was the first female assassin we played as, I liked the persona like mechanics even if it could be annoying to go back and forth at times, but I understood why they existed, and the swamp was unique even if it was clunky, however I was playing the HD version and it was terrible, the game kept crashing randomly to a point I was close to ignoring this game and moving on but kept going,

Aveline was a fine assassin, and I did like the whole idea of the Templars trying to change or hide moments by altering the memory, this game had many great ideas and was a good time, except for the crashing.


Assassin's creed 4!, my favorite assassin's creed game, I love Edward he's my favorite, he just does what he wants, and most of the time he isn't even a true assassin, which gives you this outsider perspective, yes you could say the issue of him doing good for the creed before knowing about them is strange, but I say that he did do them at different points in time, anyways, I love the ship, the shanties, the combat, I love the characters, its sad to see them all die around him, and the ending when he's with daughter was adorable, it's peak!

The only thing I could say I dislike about this game is of course everything outside, the tablet gameplay was ok at best, nothing amazing, and kinda forgettable..

Overall my favorite game alongside brotherhood.

Freedom cry was just more, this time a solo adventure with Adéwalé, to free slaves, it was a short nice time, and it wasn't a huge time sink, you can finish it in a day

It's perfectly good!


Assassin's creed rogue, the Assassin's creed game that I felt was great but also the fatigue of more of ac4 was there, I mean I just played 3 other games prior with the ships and this time we have icebergs, 

We have shay who is an assassin turned Templar, and while I like that I feel like they dumb downed the assassins in this game, made them complete assholes, and they didn't listen to any reason, I know shay isn't the most reliable person, but being there would have had more credibility then anymore else, overall exploring with shay was decent, the assassins attacking at random was alright, it was a fine time to play, even if it was written so confusing like, I do like shay however. Especially since this is a lead up to unity, and set up the story for it at the end.

Everything outside was just more of ac4 tablet gameplay and it wasn't nothing special.


Assassin's creed unity, I liked it but.
The parkour was really smooth and great but also clunky at times too, but what assassin's creed game wasn't,
Yet when it worked, wow

However I think the gameplay was bloated to be harder cause of the multiplayer mechanics, not saying it difficult or anything, you literally get the best weapon by the end of the game which makes all other weapons trivial, and you can just wreak everything grind money which is easy if you know what your doing.

Playing with other players was fun, a different taste definitely, and could be a great time, and the assassination missions were definitely a step up.

Arno was definitely just ezio, just not, and while I appreciate the attempt to capture ezio again, it just fell flat since Ubisoft doesn't do the whole multiple games per assassin anymore, so Arno is perfectly fine, I think more games would have probably gave him more time to build him up.

Also I do like the fact we were able to travel to other time periods and random, it was actually kinda cool.

The dlc sorry was a fine time, but I think too short to really have much to really think about, plus the sword you got at the end of the game was still too broken.


Assassin's creed syndicate is the last game prior to the rpg style games, it has two assassins this time, Jacob and Evie,
I like them, they are a good time, I think I like Jacob a lot for how he just want to do shit and get shit done.

The grapplehook made sense but it clearly made things trivial, and plus we can just ride a carriage now, so travel was even more less parkour and more just get in carriage and ram.

But I did like the whole gang war type of aspect even though it was half baked and kinda easy, heck the game was real easy,

Story wasn't anything too crazy too, but the final boss was strange how the twins kept getting thrown across many times

I did like how you could enter a portal and go some years into the future to one of Jacob's descendants, that was cool.

And the jack the ripper dlc was a fun time as well, especially when you played Jack.

And one big highlight was the assassinations, they were really well done here.

It was overall a good time.


After this comes origins, which I haven't played yet, but will soon and the rest, but overall I had a good time to the prior rpg games, and wonder how I'll feel about the big change from the others in origins.

I'll make my next post months later after I finished the rest, after shadow probably.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1f1w8sr/playing_every_assassins_creed_games_part_2/
239,1e2x1tw,Arcube,1720944670.0,A weird comparison between AC Unity and Footballer Olivier Giroud.,4,1,"I'm not sure how much overlap there is between the Assassin's Creed (AC) community and football fans, but for anyone who enjoys both, I think there are similarities in how AC Unity and Olivier Giroud are discussed online.

This idea came to me after watching So Says Jay's [excellent video](https://youtu.be/JNmOrmXGn0E?si=Bt3cYDHq0Klk22rb) on AC Unity. First, let's get it out of the way: they're both French. Now, let's talk presentations. AC Unity is arguably still the best-looking game in the series. Paris is incredible, with unmatched buildings, crowds, and level of detail. Similarly, Giroud is a tall, handsome man and probably one of the best-looking footballers out there.

To the point. In recent years, given how poorly the RPG games have been received by long-time fans, there's been a lot of talk about how Unity is actually one of the best in the series, with the best parkour and stealth systems. Short TikTok and YouTube videos highlight just how good the game can look, showcasing the iconic AC symbolism that is missing in newer games.

The same goes for Giroud. The TikTok crowd shows clips of his best goals and moments, with everyone in the comments talking about how underrated he is—one of the best strikers of this generation. But fans who watched him play at Arsenal, Chelsea, and for the French national team know just how mediocre and unreliable he can be. He'll score a screamer and then disappear for ten games. He missed so many easy goal opportunities it hurts to watch sometimes. He didn't score a single goal in the 2018 WC (Or shot-on-target) despite playing every single game.

I think the same of AC Unity. People focus on the great short compilations, but anyone who **actually** played the game knows how broken it still is. None of its systems work reliably, and the brief moments you manage to pull off something cool are overshadowed by the minute-to-minute gameplay.

Sorry for the long post, but I just can't stay silent while people praise this game and hold Ubisoft to such a low standard.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1e2x1tw/a_weird_comparison_between_ac_unity_and/
240,1e2i7c8,Sympthy,1720897818.0,Some Ideas for a Far Cry 4 Sequel,5,2,"Lately I've been really thinking about what happened after the events of FC4. The current story feels a little incomplete, which I think is what Ubisoft was going for, but I'm not a fan of unresolved plot points. So, I want to share my ideas for a potential sequel that I doubt we'll ever get.

First off, I think the player character would be Bhadra approximately 10 years after the events of FC4. She's a well established character, liked by the community, yet completely underdeveloped and underutilized in FC4. She's also received basic combat training from Amita, and expresses a desire to free Kyrat in the cutscene before the final balance of power mission. I imagine she would be unhappy with her role as the Tarun Matara and thinks that the country still isn't free. It would be very interesting to explore her character in depth, and she ticks all the boxes to be the protagonist.

With that, I'm assuming siding with Sabal would be the canon ending to FC4, along with sparing Amita and Pagan. He constantly guilt trips Ajay by appealing to his morality and sense of tradition. Given that Ajay is characterized as wanting to do the right thing, and is grieving throughout the game, he is more likely to be focused on the past than the future. Therefore, Sabal would get through the Ajay more effectively than Amita by playing the ""It's what your father would have wanted."" card at every opportunity. In addition, when talking to citizens around the country, their views tend to align with Sabal's views more often than not, implying more support for him from the general public. This means that in the sequel Sabal would be the new king and villain, ruling with an iron fist yet keeping the country poor. With him as the villain, we can expect to see a new deranged side of him, likely a calm, calculated madness with fits of explosive anger.

Sabal being in charge would have immediate effects on Kyrat. Drugs are now outlawed, yet still being  grown and used underground. With no reliable income and the poppy fields having destroyed good farmland, the country would be in a famine and an economic crisis. Tourists would be unwilling to travel to a country that was recently in a civil war. The only thing keeping people loyal to the crown is extreme devotion to religion. Sabal's solution is a ""cleansing"", as mentioned in FC4, and so the golden path would be on a mission to eliminate all atheists, skeptics, and followers of other religions. 

The golden path would no longer allow female fighters, destroyed statues and shrines would be prioritized for reconstruction, and industrial progress would be slowed while all of this takes place. Bhadra would have been forced to marry someone, though it’s inconclusive whether this would be Sabal. The game would kick off with a motivation for Bhadra to run away where she would meet Amita’s new freedom fighters in hiding. Amita would initially want to kill her, but realizes there would be more value in having the Tarun Matara turn against her own people, and thus convinces Bhadra to pick up a weapon once more. Bhadra likely never had to kill anyone in FC4, so she would have to bear the weight of killing people similar to Jason, but with perhaps more acceptance since she’s experienced death her whole life. 

Ajay, meanwhile, would become a governor or general of sorts, but he wouldn’t do much with the power apart from carrying out orders. I firmly believe that the events of FC4 would have left him depressed and in despair. He hates what he’s done but feels stuck where he’s at. Because of that, he was unable to claim the crown gifted to him by Min, and settled down as an empty husk. Halfway through the game, Bhadra would need to fight Ajay in an incredible battle, where our protagonists are evenly matched yet feel unwilling to fight one another. After her victory, Bhadra chooses to spare Ajay, where he disappears for a short while. A little later, Bhadra finds him waiting for her in a safe house, where he expresses wanting to help her. She accepts, and immediately he and Amita come into conflict, with Ajay enraged by the position Amita and Sabal put him in the previous game. Amita refuses to allow him into her rebellion, so Bhadra and Ajay meet in secret, where Ajay reveals he can contact Pagan for his help. If Bhadra is willing to do so, Pagan’s Royal Guard will arrive and create a third faction. From here, Bhadra must make the decision to side with Ajay/Pagan or Amita, but by choosing Ajay you will have to recapture every outpost you had captured while aligned with Amita. 

While all of this takes place, Amita and Sabal would be spouting their typical manipulative bullshit, while Ajay would be quietly listening to Bhadra’s blossoming leadership as he usually does. After learning about his past, Ajay would have been wanting to connect with Pagan somehow, but only found the courage to do so after being defeated and going into hiding. Bhadra should have greater reason to trust Ajay over Amita or Sabal due to their personalities, but she should also be wary of the fact he is backed by Pagan. Ajay had what felt like an older brother relationship with Bhadra in FC4, so I would want that to be explored.

The nukes would be a fairly important plot point, but I have no idea what they would be used for. Kyrat doesn't seem to be beefing with any other countries, so unless someone would want to use it on south Kyrat, I don't think the story would involve firing them. I also highly doubt that they would be fired at Hope County (except by accident?) because that just seems so random. Perhaps the motivation would be to illegally sell them to another country, turning it into another balance of power mission.

That’s all I’ve got so far. I’m sure it sounds a lot like weird fanfiction (because it honestly is), but I think it would be an interesting sequel where we really get to learn more about Ajay and Bhadra while getting to free Kyrat for real. Let me know what you think, or if something is missing or sounds ridiculous.",https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1e2i7c8/some_ideas_for_a_far_cry_4_sequel/

242,1djrswr,EternalDahaka,1718825449.0,Controller Deadzone and Curve Graphs and Potential Requests For Improvement,18,10,"Hello everyone.  I test deadzones and curves in games and have tested R6S a few times as it has popped up on free weekends. 
 Unfortunately because of the recent deadzone bugs I wasn't able to test reliably to make updated graphs for it, but I think there are some things to comment on for what I could test.

[Deadzone/Curve graph/tests](https://i.imgur.com/wtT4mzp.png)

(The rightmost dotgraph is the recent camera tests, the others are pre-advanced controls update.  Note: The outer deadzone was tested with the Classic curve.  The Updated curve outerdeadzone should be a few percent larger, like shown on the curve tests)

I've tried to illustrate the ranges I was able to test this past weekend in an interactive graph.  The ""random extra deadzone"" is to try and show how the randomly increasing deadzone can 'eat' some of the slower turn speeds:

[Graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gi1r3gwkyb)

***Deadzone - R6S's deadzone values have always been wrong***

With the bugs any deadzone size a players sets is inconsistent, and during play the deadzone can change size.  For example, setting the the deadzone at 0, the lowest I could test was 5%, but also saw 13%, 22%(these two are the rogue points in the top right glitched test), and even 50%.

It seems like there would be a 'set' deadzone, where the curve would scale around the deadzone, but random deadzone increases(that the game makes, not the player) during gameplay would eat into the curve, making small adjustments impossible.

All this ideally should be fixed when Ubisoft addresses this, and/or reverts whatever change causes this.  However, as the older tests show, the deadzone values have always been inaccurate.  The previous lowest deadzone you could set was 5%, but that gave a 10% camera deadzone, and at 50%, it was about 53/54%.  Movement deadzones were generally larger.

The deadzone slider allows setting the deadzone to 0, but the lowest I could tests was 5%.  Given the tested real sizes, there seems to be an underlying 5% deadzone that would need to be removed for the deadzone options to be accurate.  Fixing this recent bug won't be enough.

***Outer Deadzone***

All the tested outer deadzone values were wrong, but broadly consistent.  The Classic curve always had a slightly lower outerdeadzone than the Updated one.  Before the advanced controls update the outer deadzone was 0(100% stick tilt), but as of this test at a value of 0 with Updated the curve would cap/acceleration would trigger at 86%.

This may be an issue with the current deadzone bug, but these should be made correct.

***Separate axis acceleration***

You can see in the older tests/colored graph, there is a break in the acceleration regions which corresponds to a larger jump in horizontal acceleration.  These threshold were different when testing this weekend.  I wasn't able to test these properly, but the issue with this method is accelerating one axis at a time skew diagonal movement towards the more sensitivity axis.  Your diagonal movement is only correctly preserved if both axes are accelerated at the same time, which would occur in the regions they overlap.

***Classic curve always has acceleration + Updated curve always has smoothing***

There have been a few complaints around these since the Updated curve was first added.

The classic curve has always had ~2x jump in turn speed near the end of stick movement.  This could feel jarring since accidentally passing that threshold could have players overshoot.

Updated was a quadratic curve without an acceleration jump to address those complaints, but had some smoothing applied, which can make aiming feel more sluggish and less predictable.

The advanced controls have options to control both, but you cannot use them to remove acceleration from classic, or smoothing from updated, only add more to each.

It'd be better to remove those aspects from each curve and let players use the advanced options to apply those if they want them.

***TL;DR***

* Fix Deadzone bug

* Deadzone slider values were always wrong, make the options accurate to what they actually are.  Same with outer deadzone values.

* Unify the acceleration threshold.  Accelerating both axes at once will preserve correct diagonal movement.

* Remove acceleration from the classic curve, and smoothing from updated.  The advanced options can be used to do both.

That's it.  Hopefully the deadzone bug gets addressed soon.  The random increases that eat small acceleration values are especially bad and feel like they'd make potatoes out of anyone.  But hopefully the additional changes can be made to iron out some of the misc issues R6S has had for much longer.

243,1djvc2g,Smasherjet,1718834449.0,I’m finally done with siege,2,5,"I want to start this out by saying that Siege has garnered a substantial player base and  amazing critical acclaim since its release. Yet, despite its popularity, the game has a lot of problems that currently make it unplayable. In this short essay, I want to talk about various problems with Siege that have led me, and many other people to deem it an truly awful game.

1. Technical Issues and Bugs

One of the most constant complaints I have about Siege is its technical instability. Since launch, the game has been plagued with a variety of bugs and glitches. The issues range from minor graphical glitches to severe problems that impact gameplay, such as hit registration issues where bullets seemingly fail to hit their target despite accurate aiming. Bugs like this are incredibly frustrating, especially in a game that relies heavily on precision and strategy.

Additionally, server stability has been a recurring problem. I frequently experience connectivity issues, lag, and server downtimes, which can be particularly frustrating in a competitive environment. A stable and reliable online experience is crucial for any multiplayer game, and Siege often falls short in this regard.

Ubisoft is a multi billion dollar company and  According to a May 2024 report from Ubisoft, Rainbow Six Siege is one of the company's largest and most profitable games. with this in mind there is no excuse for the issues in question existing for as long as they have.

2. Toxic Community

The community surrounding Siege has gained a reputation for being extremely toxic. Instances of harassment, hate speech, and griefing are very common both in the game, and throughout social media. While toxicity can be found in essentially all online multiplayer games, the severity and frequency within Siege are still remarkable. As a relatively new player, I often find it challenging to acclimate due to the frankly violent reception I receive from more seasoned players. This unwelcoming atmosphere can and has deterred new players and I can only assume  erodes the enjoyment for existing ones.

Ubisoft has obviously tried to curb toxic behavior through in-game reporting systems and automated bans, but these measures have had limited to no success. The persistence of toxicity continues to tarnish the game's reputation and diminish the overall player experience more than most other games.

3. Steep Learning Curve and Poor Onboarding

Siege is well known for its steep learning curve. The game’s complicated mechanics, operator abilities, and strategic design, make it challenging for newcomers like myself to grasp, but I don’t really have a problem with that. While a deep and complex game can be rewarding, Siege does little to ease new players into its demanding environment. The in-game tutorials felt inadequate, often failing to cover the nuances and strategies essential for actually doing good in real games.

This lack of proper onboarding leaves me feeling overwhelmed and outmatched, leading to frustration and a steep barrier to entry. Without proper guidance, many newcomers including myself give up before they have a chance to fully appreciate the game's intricacies.

4. Imbalance and Meta Issues

Balancing a game with so many unique operators and gadgets is a monumental task, no one is denying that, but Siege has still really struggled in this area. Certain operators  consistently feel more powerful or versatile than others, and more often than not this more powerful operators are the newer ones which cost more renown, leading to a skewed meta where the same characters feel like they are repeatedly chosen.

Ubisoft releases new operators often, but this often exacerbates the balance issues. New characters sometimes debut in an overpowered state, prompting backlash from the community and necessitating subsequent nerfs. This cycle of imbalance and adjustment can be frustrating for players who desire a stable and fair competitive environment.

5. Monotony and Lack of Content

Despite the frequent addition of new operators and maps, Siege really started feeling monotonous quick. The core gameplay loop remains largely unchanged, leading to a sense of repetitiveness. While the game offers a lot of maps and modes, the fundamental gameplay experience does not change significantly. This is especially frustrating when you look at how other games like overwatch have constant events and content updates that help keep it fresh.

Additionally, I feel that Ubisoft's focus on adding new operators detracts from the development of other types of content, such as new game modes or significant updates to existing maps. Even though they did not add a new operator this season there is still a perceived lack of content diversity that contributes to the feeling of monotony and limits the game's replayability.

6. Microtransactions and Monetization

I know that Siege is not the only game that is trying to squeeze ever cent out of its player base, but it still needs to be held accountable for its awful monetization practices. The game features numerous microtransactions, including cosmetic items, seasonal passes, and now a monthly subscription. While cosmetics do not impact gameplay, the high cost of these items is still extremely greedy.

The reliance on microtransactions creates a sense of ""pay-to-look-good,"" where players feel pressured to spend real money to access desirable content. This business model can be seen as exploitative, particularly when combined with the game's initial purchase price and the cost of seasonal passes.

7. Cheating and Exploits

Cheating is a huge issue in Siege. Despite Ubisoft's “efforts” to combat cheating through anti-cheat software and ban waves, cheaters continue to plague the game. Hacks and exploits, such as aimbots and wallhacks, give players an unfair advantage, undermining the integrity of the competitive experience.

The presence of cheaters can be incredibly demoralizing, particularly in ranked play where fair competition is paramount. The ongoing struggle to maintain a cheat-free environment detracts from the enjoyment and fairness of the game.

8. Unrealized Potential

Perhaps one of the most frustrating aspects of Siege is its unrealized potential. The game has a solid foundation with its unique blend of tactical gameplay, destructible environments, and operator abilities. However, the persistent issues mentioned above hinder the game from reaching its full potential.

I often lament what Siege could have been if not for its technical problems, toxic community, steep learning curve, balance issues, monotony, monetization practices, and cheating. The game’s potential for greatness is evident, but its execution falls short in many areas.

I have given siege a really fair chance. I bought it back in mid 2023 and I have really tried to enjoy it but given the problems that I have talked about in the short essay I really don’t think that I can play anymore. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1djvc2g/im_finally_done_with_siege/

I got to gold and spent a whole week going against cheater after cheater and during the games that I didn't have a cheater me or a teammate would crash on round one, the match cancels and somebody ends up with a penalty. I understand the crashing is just part of the game and it will be fixed eventually but could somebody please explain why something like

-being reported multiple times in a day

-having a 100% weapon accuracy

-an account being logged in from multiple IPs

doesn't have any consequence at all? I know ubi is leaning more towards automated bans with AI and it wont be too long until it can start working properly. Just looking at numbers alone, it can't be that hard to automatically see somebody is blatant and put the player against other reported players for an hour or two while somebody manually checks.

Even if the billion dollar company doesn't have the manpower for something like that, what's stopping them from making something similar to Overwatch from CSGO? If they trust their rep system enough, put the Esteemed players as investigators **(wouldn't manual bans give the AI more reliable data?)**. It just seems like Ubisoft is entirely complacent and is just enjoying the new revenue flow from cheaters until this cash cow of a game is sucked dry.

The games still somewhat fun and what sucks is that instead of ruining the game thru dumb maps or downright stupid balance changes they decide to do it in their complacency. I really hope this new anticheat gets all the data it needs before the game just outright dies.

Again I don't know if its not as cut and dry as I've described it just **seems like there's a lot of** **temporary or even bad solutions that would be much better than nothing** (just telling the community there's more data to ban people with)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1dbjldf/climbing_low_ranks_cheaters/
245,1cry27a,Cygus_Lorman,1715708238.0,New Shadows info from leaker j0nathan,306,481,"If you already didn't know who j0nathan is, then he's arguably one of the most reliable leakers when it comes to Assassin's Creed (only second behind Tom Henderson, imo), and has shared multiple leaks in the past back when the game still used to be known as Codename Red. 

[Just a little over an hour ago, he posted a new video about Shadows. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peP8iGVdCH0&t=89)

**STORY DETAILS:** 

- Yasuke: j0nathan expands a bit more on his backstory. He starts off as a slave on a ship (deviation from bodyguarding a Jesuit in lore?). Said ship is invaded by a group of men (I'm assuming random pirates) and everyone—including his wife—is killed, and he's left for dead for days before he's found and brought to a temple in Japan. There, he learns about the samurai while in the service of Oda Nobunaga.

- Corroborates an earlier leak of Hattori Hanzō. j0nathan speculates we'll get to see his death happen since he historically dies in 1597.

- Naoe: Just a repeat of [his earlier tweet about her name and backstory](https://twitter.com/xj0nathan/status/1716063638547530049) about the Order (has to be the Templars, not the Ancients) killing her father (even adds her entire family being added to that in the new video), and that pushes her to join the shinobi/Assassins (he actually says it's unclear to him about whether or not it's join or create, but it *has* to be join since the shinobi were already active for 200+ years).

**j0nathan then spends the next few minutes talking about the cryptic code Ubisoft posted, but he hasn't said anything new. He then talks about the cinematic trailer for a bit, but Google Translate is so shoddy that I couldn't tell just what exactly he was talking about, only something about the Japanese countryside shown in the snippet Ubisoft shared.** 

**Prices:** 

- j0nathan then talks about a [a post made by Twitter user Ubisoft\_Frax](https://twitter.com/Ubisoft_Frax/status/1790016089226608779) (was this the same guy who originally leaked the Shadows name change?) about some of the prices in the game.

There's also [another post about the game's base price being $59.99](https://twitter.com/Ubisoft_Frax/status/1790110727774130281), but j0nathan speculates it's just the price on PC since ""it's always a little cheaper than on console"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1cry27a/new_shadows_info_from_leaker_j0nathan/
246,1cho46w,SunBaskingLobster,1714575142.0,Give Ela a Bump,20,16,"Ela is one of the worst trap ops. 

Fenrir can take eyes with a gadget that can constantly reproc while also giving sound ques. In terms of his loadout, he has a really solid and reliable primary with a bailiff to create rotates. 

Kapkan (I’m on console) can easily snag kills for the team at no risk while also having a reliable primary and a nitro for more free-ish kills.

Lesions gadget puts in a lot of free damage as well as gives sound ques to defenders which they can bait attackers to either keep the gu in or just outright swing them. His primary is amazing and on top of all that he gets a super shorty?

Melusi’s gadget is 50/50 but if the user knows what they’re doing, easily surpasses what Ela can do. With that in mind, she also has a decent yet reliable primary with an acog as well as impacts to be aggressive.

Ela’s gadget is a one and done that does no damage nor gives constant intel. In most cases that an attacker does activate it, they can run away or still just swing you because the gadget is no where near as punishing as the others. Compound that with the fact that her gun is just meh now. You can lose control of recoil if you’re not locked in with it shooting literal peas. You also can’t be as aggressive as all the other ops due to lack of rotate making abilities or lack of constant intel or straight lethality like a nitro. 

(Some of the best guns in regards to damage and fire rate have the lowest amount of recoil.) 
They should reduce the recoil climb of Ela’s gun and make it come in later into the mag. They should give her four mines or make it slow people again. Lastly they should give her impacts, since they got nerfed, or be daring and give her a nitro. Other ops can pretty much do her role but with an entirely better kit.

But Ubisoft would rather make a fenrir 2.0 than buff underperforming ops.

247,1casu4h,throwaway388585293,1713837687.0,Crash on splash screen for WD1,3,0,"EDIT: Wow I think I fixed it. MSI's ""MSI Center,"" I believe is the culprit to all of my issues. I exited MSI center and the game took a bit to boot but it did. I've completely removed it from my system and have no reason to reinstall it, RGB software is always so bad lol. 

Hey guys, not sure if this is the right place to post it but figured I'd ask. And I did send a support ticket to Ubisoft so hopefully they'll be able to help me but figured it wouldn't hurt to ask here. This is pretty wordy so TL;DR at bottom.

Watch\_Dogs 1 is completely unplayable for me on PC. Every time I attempt to launch the game I get to the splash screen and then my CPU usage spikes to 100% and it crashes. Before I fixed my drivers this was actually causing my computer to BSOD. It's not a matter of specs as I have a 4090 and 13900k **(full specs at the bottom)**. BSODs were due to a bugcheck and SYSTEM\_SERVICE\_EXCEPTION which I believe were related to drivers that got messed up. Possibly due to upgrading from Windows 10 to 11 or from Nvidia's Beta Client, I really haven't figured that out but hopefully DDU sorted it, it hasn't occurred since I reinstalled drivers.

Things I've tried: (I've been having some relative system instability anyways so I figured I'd just go all out lol.)

* DDU (hopefully fixed some corrupted drivers I had from the new Nvidia beta client)
* Reinstalling/verifying files
* Disabling in game overlays for Shadowplay and Ubisoft
* Launching the game in administrator mode and compatibility modes
* Launching the game through Ubisoft Connect instead of Steam

Sort of at a loss for what to do next, I think the only thing I can do realistically is wait for new drivers to come out. I have made alterations in my BIOs to some settings for my CPU and XMP is enabled but I sincerely doubt it's that. From a hardware perspective everything checks out, I've ran benchmarks on RAM, CPU, and GPU respectively with no issues. Drives are healthy, etc.

Now here's another interesting bit, from Reliability Monitor and Event Viewer I can see the crashes are being caused by a file named ""systemdetection64.dll"" and the problem event name is BEX64/APPCRASH. This is within the Watch\_Dogs bin folder so I'm really not too sure. I've also seen posts going back many years talking about this issue that I'm having except no one has a solution. Really the only thing I haven't tried is running my computer with clean startup and having no conflicting software or anything but I'll try that if it's recommended.

I really really appreciate anyone who can help me out with this, obviously I'll await support's answer as well but doubt it'll do much to be honest lmfao. Thanks!

248,1bq9j2i,Technical-Fig6464,1711667009.0,Shotguns are horribly underpowered.,4,71,"Since the rework that made aiming down sights with a shotgun better and hipfiring worse, they ""standarized"" the hipfire spread circle and they removed the laser's 25% smaller hipfire circle.

Before that, they nerfed several shotguns (Super-90 comes to mind) to the point that with the current nerfs they are utterly outclassed by any other option, to the point a pistol is more attractive and a nerfed semi-auto.

Ubisoft needs to take a good look at the shotguns ASAP, using them right now is handicapping yourself, even in defense.

ALSO: to all the people saying that ""shotguns are fine"" because if you aim you can kill someone at very close range are really missing the point. 

No, just because you say that the ""german shotgun slams bro! haha"" does not make the problem go away.

Shotguns are outclassed by every weapon at every range, and even at close range machine pistols are much more reliable and consistent. A class of weapons that specializes at close range gets outclassed in their own niche by secondaries.

Finally, to all the people saying that I can't use shotguns or that anyone who says they are weak is bad at the game, you add nothing to the discussion.

So like all of us, I'm used to the game deciding to just freeze up pre-Resolve. Since then I was pleasantly surprised to see that dramatically reduced. But now, after working just fine last night, the game reliably crashes out moments after launching, when the progress bar under the epilepsy warning text is mostly gone. The screen flashes back, then I'm dropped back to the desktop and see Ubisoft's ""syncing your achievements with the cloud"" popup briefly.

I've tried (along with plenty of googling):

* Verifying files
* Full cold start shutdown and reboot
* Disabling in-game overlay (both ubisoft and discord)
* Uninstalling and reinstalling (including carving out game and settings folders)
* Uninstalling and reinstalling Ubisoft Connect and then reinstalling div
* Updating GPU drivers, including with DDU nuke and pave
* Running EAC's rather uninformative ""repair"" button
* adding dx11 and -dx11 to the launch arguments
* switching the game to windowed mode on launch with alt-enter
* reinstalling it to a different SSD
* Windows Memory Diagnostic, came back clean
* Dropping RAM speed from 3600 to 2666
* Disabling ISLC
* I haven't changed anything about my setup recently - in fact, I have Windows Updates paused for the week, so I know for sure one didn't sneak in.

Desperately hoping someone can suggesting things I haven't thought of yet.

[[TD2] Year 5 Season 3: Vanguard img - 11](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2e3TSl7lQYehLC1GZqkTei/d69c77d4bcb35f3b7a6ba2cadc6ef670/11._New_Expertise_Cost.jpg)

&nbsp;

#### **Recalibration and Optimization**

*   Merged both functions into one tab - Tinkering
*   Players are now unable to optimize beyond the value stored in their Recalibration Library.
*   The optimization upgrade steps have been modified so that players will no longer be required to pay the full price for an incomplete optimization step.
    *   **Example**: You have **+10% SMG Damage** in the Library and are trying to optimize an SMG that currently has **+9.7% SMG Damage**. Since the highest value in your library is **+10%**, you will only be able to upgrade by **+0.3% and** will only pay the material price for the **0.3%** portion instead of paying the full price of an upgrade step.

&nbsp;

#### **Recalibration Library**

*   It has received UI improvements and can be accessed from the Tinkering Station. 

&nbsp;

#### **Skill Mods**

    *   When a superior Skill Mod is acquired, it will automatically replace the existing one, resulting in the deconstruction of the inferior mod.
    *   Similarly, if an inferior Skill Mod is obtained, it will be automatically deconstructed.
    *   In both scenarios, the deconstructed Skill Mod will yield the corresponding amount of printer filament.

&nbsp;

### GAME MODES

252,16vvvpj,the_assgard,1696043191.0,Where can one get reliable support from Ubisoft?,13,15,I have no words at this point. This was such a basic request. BBB wasn't much help. They may have encouraged the spurt of responses I saw but that didn't last long. Just floating in the ether.,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/16vvvpj
253,15wxks3,aRorschachTest,1692593599.0,"Outside operator balance changes, what changes would you make to siege?",1,13,"This could be anything from overhauling maps, to reworking the sound engine, to reworking attachments.

Personally I’d change the angled grip. The aim in time is negligible. Beaulo thinks that in their current state they are useless, but in a TDM meta I’d rather it not get buffed. Instead I’d make it have horizontal recoil control. Probably not the same as the vertical grip offers for vertical recoil control. 

I’d change the sound system to hopefully make it more reliable. It’s old and fairly outdated now. There’s been a season long audio bug that causes infinite shooting. It could use some work if not a full replacement.

I’d also make changes to fortress. I think with some changes that it could be a good ranked map.

I definitely would also change how smoke grenades work. Right now you can shoot a smoke grenade at a ceiling and the smoke will clip through the floor and block lines of site above. (Easiest done with capitao). I haven’t tested this in a while but last I checked it still worked like this.

I’d also remove the detonation delay from claymores, but in turn make their lasers more visible. I had someone jump out a window last week, land on the claymore, and take no damage because they had just enough time to get out of the way before it detonated. I don’t know how he survived. He was a vigil player too. Could’ve impacted the claymore, but I get punished because he is lucky.

1.5x and grenade reworks are already on the horizon.

Laser sight buff. I almost never see the laser used outside shotguns. It’s too high risk for a low reward. 

An option for ash and capitao. To use their gadgets in place of a grip. It would add another level of customization that would effect gameplay. This would double for Buck and Nomad where they would have an option to carry around their gadget detached from their weapons and in turn get under barrel grips.

The ability to buy alpha packs with R6 credits (no duplicates). I don’t know why this isn’t a thing. It seems like free money for Ubisoft. It might be due to some laws that this isn’t a thing. I’m not a lawyer, I wouldn’t know.

A tweak that decreases audio by how slow you move. This would have to be after a sound rework. In current siege with the inconsistencies in audio it’s for the best, by long term it would be nice to sacrifice speed for subtlety. Stealth should be a valid tactic and outside of Cav, vigil, and nokk, it really isn’t. Especially with the amount of cameras, proxy beepers, and traps in siege.

Built in observation blockers for the bulletproof windows on stadium bravo. No explanation needed. These windows are horseshit and ruin what would otherwise be a good map. Also fix how jackal can track people through those windows.

I’d finally add some sort of inertia to movement because for as much as I abuse jiggle peeking, it should not be nearly as strong as it is.

Since it seems Ubisoft is done selling operator seasonal uniforms and headgears , I’d once again allow them to be purchased in the store. Not the individual pieces, but the bundle. 

Nightmaps in Quick Match.

And finally an update to mousetrap to effect the no recoil cheaters. They showed up in spades since mousetrap went live a made keyboards futile.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/15wxks3/outside_operator_balance_changes_what_changes/
254,154rjo7,Ornery_Inflation4485,1689861147.0,Far Cry 6 Crash Fix,8,7,"This post is for those who experience constant crashes that make the game unplayable, on PC.

A. Does your Far Cry 6 crash after the main menu loading screen?  
B. Does it crash in game?  
I may have found the ultimate reliable fix.  


**The fix:**

* Don't have any sort of browser open while playing. Browser is the main cause of loading screen crash. Don't have discord open since it's an electron app like a browser, or any other app that could be browser based. I recommend you restart your PC if you opened browser/apps.
* Turn on Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling in your PC's settings (see screenshot). This fixes in-game crashes.
* Custom add FC6 to Graphics performance preference, and set it to ""High performance"" (see screenshot)

[Graphics settings under Display settings in Windows](https://preview.redd.it/x73vjugrj4db1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=c31823d6984b7c5ecb90758b5cd343244479ecf3)

Also, doing this may reduce crashes:

* Open `Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Far Cry 6\bin_plus\FarCry6.exe`
* Open above with admin

&#x200B;

Things I tried that did **NOT** help with fixing the crash

* Lower resolution in graphics settings
* Borderless window mode or windowed mode
* Update GeForce driver (doesn't help but this is good practice)
* Disable GeForce overlay
* Disable Ubisoft in game overlay
* Play offline
* Verify files (result is that there's nothing to fix)
* Set FPS lock in graphics settings (sets maximum FPS)
* Add Ubisoft connect and Uplay to Windows defender firewall allowed apps
* Exclude `Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft` folder from windows defender
* Remove all Visual Studio C++ redistributables and reinstall game
* Reinstalling in different hard drive
* Reinstall using Epic games instead of Ubisoft
* Disable V-Sync
* Change graphics settings to highest or lowest - this has nothing to do with crash

&#x200B;

Things I haven't tried which probably will not help

* I never downloaded the HD textures pack
* Update DirectX (latest version of DirectX ships with Windows anyways)
* Deleting Ubisoft launcher cache
* Disabling overclock on GPU - mine is not overclocked
* Bios memory set to auto (mine is already set to auto)

&#x200B;

My PC runs on Ryzen 5, RTX 3080, 16GB RAM with plenty of SSD space, so I doubt the crashes are because of PC specs.

I hope this helps other gamers. I'm just glad I don't have to refund this game.

255,151439w,EnvironmentalTie4399,1689507511.0,# Proposal for Faster Launch Times in Rainbow Six Siege & Game enhancements,11,0,"
## Issue

Many users have reported delays and long wait times when launching Rainbow Six Siege (R6) on PC. The current launch time is approximately 2-5 minutes, with additional waiting time to connect to servers. This not only hampers the user experience but also may lead to penalties for users who are unable to connect in a timely manner. 

## Objective

We aim to reduce the game's launch time and server connection time significantly. This will help to improve the user experience, reduce the occurrence of unwarranted penalties, and potentially increase player retention.

## Proposed Solution

We suggest Ubisoft to investigate and implement the following potential improvements:

1. **Optimize Game Files:** Check if there is any possibility of optimizing game files or resources that are loaded during startup. If some resources are not necessary during the initial launch, they could be loaded asynchronously after the game has started.

2. **Improve Server Connection:** Review the process of connecting to the server. If it's taking longer than expected, there may be room for performance improvements or better server distribution.

3. **Update Launcher:** If the game launcher itself is slow, it could be optimized or updated for better performance.

4. **Bug Fixes:** Resolve any known bugs that might be slowing down the game's launch or server connection process.

## Impact

By implementing these potential solutions, we expect a significant reduction in the launch time and server connection time of R6. This can lead to an enhanced gaming experience for all users and a reduction in the number of unwarranted penalties.

# R6Fix (PC)

We need to reinstate the superior audio system from the Y8 s2.2 update. There's an impression among players that the development team is introducing new bugs rather than resolving the existing ones. The quality of the updates, particularly Y8 s2.3, has been disappointing, especially concerning audio functionalities.

We, as players, deserve higher quality patch updates. I urge you to focus on enhancing the performance and reliability of these updates, rather than rushing them out.

## Known Issues

1. **UAE Server (Ping):** We've observed significant latency issues when connecting to the UAE server. This interferes with gameplay and is a recurring problem.

2. **Audio Loop:** There's a persistent issue with the audio looping inappropriately, which detracts from the gaming experience 

Audio Quality is bad at the moment Patch Y8S2.3 feels like 2.0 stereo with a lot of detracts ( Bass ) un optimized audio ..  

3. **Game Launch Time:** The time it takes for the game to launch is considerably long. This leads to a less-than-ideal user experience and should be optimized for better performance.

256,14iegtd,Mikki79,1687673080.0,Ubisoft Connect is terrible.,13,4,"For some reason I can't ever reliably connect  to ubisoft connect (irony that name)

I can't remember the last time I failed to connect to Steam, Epic, EA (whatever it's called), Battlenet etc... but for some reason whenever I leave my PC on for a while it's more or less guaranteed that ubisoft ""disconnect"" won't be able to go online. When I made a ticket they told me to disable IPV6 or whatever, which did work, until it didn't. Sometimes ubisoft disconnect only works with IPV6 enabled, sometimes it only works with it disabled. Sometimes it refuses to connect no matter what I do.

I honestly feel very reluctant to buy any ubisoft games, especially if they require you to be online to play. I recently bought immortals phoenix rising when it was on sale, which luckily works even if you're offline. 

Ubisoft disconnect also recently corrupted my Division 2 install, and it can't fix it. It says it needs to verify the game files, when it's done it downloads some files but fail to install them. Then it says it cant find the game folder. When I manually search for the folder it says it needs to verify the game files first, and downloads some files again which it can't install again etc etc... I'd have to reinstall the game to play it, but since I can't reliably connect to ubisoft anyway, why bother.

Why can't they even make a game launcher that can reliably connect to their servers when no other launcher seems to have problems connecting to their servers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/14iegtd/ubisoft_connect_is_terrible/

#Shades of Red

Year 6 Season 2: Shades of Red is marking the start of a new seasonal journey. With Aaron Keener in custody at the White House, he aims to strike a deal with The Division. Before Agents can learn what he knows, they have to secure the other members of Keener's team, starting with Theo Parnell.

&nbsp;

***
##SEASONS 2.0

###Seasonal Journey

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season's content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

###Seasonal Modifiers

=> [Season Modifiers]( https://i.imgur.com/XfduRhn.png)

The Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience: 

*   **Global Modifiers** set the overall theme of the season and are active at all times while the system is enabled, affecting the core gameplay loop. 
    *   This season, the theme is ""range."" The Global Modifier, ""Point Blank,"" grants a bonus damage based on distance from enemies. 
*   **Active Modifiers** function like ""ultimate"" abilities, giving your character a short burst of power. 
    *   Players can choose from a selection of Active Modifiers, but only one can be equipped at a time. This season, they manipulate the range zones set by the Global Modifier. 
*   **Passive Modifiers** work in conjunction with the Global Modifier, adding extra bonuses. 
    *   Players can equip up to three Passive Modifiers simultaneously. In the first season, these modifiers provide additional benefits based on the range zones from the Global Modifier. 
*   **Hostile Modifiers:** These represent how the enemies adapt to your new abilities. 
    *   As players progress through the season, enemies will gradually gain new abilities linked to specific enemy types, forcing you to use the Global, Passive, and Active Modifiers strategically to counter them. 

The modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges. 

&nbsp;

###Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

Players can choose from three objectives, selecting one based on limited information such as duration, reward category, and mission type. Once a selection is made, it is locked in, and the full details of the objective and its rewards will be revealed.

If none of the objectives appeal to the player, the system allows for rerolls and has an Abandon Objective feature. Players can earn reroll points by completing Priority Objectives, with a maximum of three rerolls stored at any time.

There is no limit to the number of Priority Objectives a player can complete, and rewards include XP, Season Pass XP, items, resources, and passive modifier unlocks.  

&nbsp;

###Manhunt Scouts

=> [Parnell Manhunt](https://i.imgur.com/khEGjlR.jpeg)

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

Each week, players can tackle a Scout, which consists of three different activities. These activities will vary, and players must solve a small riddle to complete each one. Activities should be completed in order, and once all three are finished, players will receive the Scout Reward.

Once all activities in a Scout are completed, players will receive a bigger reward, including a unique collectible. However, new Scouts cannot be accessed until the current one is completed.

By the end of the season, completing all Scouts unlocks the Manhunt Climax Mission, and finishing that unlocks the Master Climax Mission, so make sure to stay on track each week.

258,1fsd9ij,Raidenski,1727639990.0,The (Chiappa) Rhino was specifically designed to reduce recoil...so why does it still have such horribly low stability in this game? ,231,41,"The Rhino, developed and produced by Chiappa Firearms, was designed with a 6 o'clock, low-bore axis, where the barrel is located on the bottom of the frame as opposed to the more traditional 12 o'clock top-bore axis located at the top of the frame. 

This design, which was patented by Emilio Ghisoni, who also designed the Mateba Model 6 Única (aka Mateba Autorevolver), was made specifically to reduce recoil often experienced in traditional revolvers; firing a bullet from the Chiappa Rhino, the kickback would push the firearm backwards, as opposed to upwards. 

Realistically speaking, the Rhino was designed specifically to have less recoil than your average revolver/pistol, and should havet he highest stability out of all the sidearms available in the game, so why is it that firing this gun in the game has such really bad recoil? 

As a relatively new player, when I first saw this weapon in the Weapons Vendor, I was excited to unlock it at a later point, and when I finally found a copy and fired away, I was beyond disappointed at just how horrible the recoil is; at the very least it should have the same level of recoil as the M1911, if not miles better. 

Did Ubisoft just add it into the game without doing any research on it whatsoever just because it looks cool? 

I know this is just a videogame, but as someone who's been interested in firearms for most of their life, I would have expected a multi-billion dollar videogame developer to have done at least some research into a weapon's designs and how the effect of changing traditional designs would impact the functionality of a weapon, especially as something as fundamentally different as a 6 o'clock barrel.

Deliberations come after fall in game developer’s share price

Tencent, Guillemot family hold minority stakes in French firm

Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Ubisoft Entertainment SA’s founding Guillemot family are considering options including a potential buyout of the French video game developer after it lost more than half its market value this year, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Chinese tech company and Guillemot Brothers Ltd. have been speaking with advisers to help explore ways to stabilize Ubisoft and bolster its value, the people said, asked not to be identified discussing a private matter. One of the possibilities being discussed would involve teaming up to take the company private, according to the people.

Shares of Ubisoft have fallen 54% in Paris trading this year, giving the company a market capitalization of about €1.4 billion ($1.5 billion). Tencent owned 9.2% of Ubisoft’s net voting rights at the end of April, while the Guillemot family held about 20.5%, according to the firm’s latest annual report.

Some minority shareholders including AJ Investments have been pushing for either a take-private or a sale of Ubisoft to a strategic investor amid the stock price plunge. Considerations are at an early stage and there’s no certainty they will lead to a transaction. Tencent and the Guillemot family are also considering other alternatives, according to the people.

Spokespeople for Ubisoft and the Guillemot family declined to comment. A representative for Tencent couldn’t immediately comment during a holiday week in China.

Last month, Ubisoft shares fell to their lowest in more than a decade after the company cut its outlook on weaker-than expected sales and a delay on the hotly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows title. The video game firm has over the past couple of years struggled to recover from a pandemic-era production crunch that resulted in delays in the release of new games and canceled titles.

Several private equity firms including Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. were studying potential bids for Ubisoft in 2022 amid a flurry of large deals in the video game industry, Bloomberg News reported at the time. Later that year, the founding family partnered with Tencent, which bought 49.9% of the Guillemot Brothers holding company in addition to the direct stake it held in Ubisoft.

The deal was seen by analysts as a way of keeping suitors at bay, allowing the brothers to remain in control of the Ubisoft’s governance with Tencent’s stake capped below 10% with no operational veto rights. Under the deal, Tencent also couldn’t sell its shares in Ubisoft for five years, after which the Guillemot family has the right of first refusal. The pact still allows the brothers to talk and work with whoever they want, Ubisoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yves Guillemot said in an interview last year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1fw0evu/tencent_guillemot_family_are_said_to_consider/

If not, Ubisoft if you read your reddit, please don't. The Vulkan API has been such a boon for people with lower tier hardware as the DX11 and DX12 have been buggy and/or a performance drain compared to Vulkan. 

This is the biggest tragedy of the next season and I hope Ubi reverses course on this, otherwise I hope they can ensure some level of stability for lower tier hardware (DX is a Microsoft product so I'm doubting they can ensure it)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1f2j5vr/vulkan_api_removal_from_y9s3/

263,1djvc2g,Smasherjet,1718834449.0,I’m finally done with siege,3,5,"I want to start this out by saying that Siege has garnered a substantial player base and  amazing critical acclaim since its release. Yet, despite its popularity, the game has a lot of problems that currently make it unplayable. In this short essay, I want to talk about various problems with Siege that have led me, and many other people to deem it an truly awful game.

1. Technical Issues and Bugs

One of the most constant complaints I have about Siege is its technical instability. Since launch, the game has been plagued with a variety of bugs and glitches. The issues range from minor graphical glitches to severe problems that impact gameplay, such as hit registration issues where bullets seemingly fail to hit their target despite accurate aiming. Bugs like this are incredibly frustrating, especially in a game that relies heavily on precision and strategy.

Additionally, server stability has been a recurring problem. I frequently experience connectivity issues, lag, and server downtimes, which can be particularly frustrating in a competitive environment. A stable and reliable online experience is crucial for any multiplayer game, and Siege often falls short in this regard.

Ubisoft is a multi billion dollar company and  According to a May 2024 report from Ubisoft, Rainbow Six Siege is one of the company's largest and most profitable games. with this in mind there is no excuse for the issues in question existing for as long as they have.

2. Toxic Community

The community surrounding Siege has gained a reputation for being extremely toxic. Instances of harassment, hate speech, and griefing are very common both in the game, and throughout social media. While toxicity can be found in essentially all online multiplayer games, the severity and frequency within Siege are still remarkable. As a relatively new player, I often find it challenging to acclimate due to the frankly violent reception I receive from more seasoned players. This unwelcoming atmosphere can and has deterred new players and I can only assume  erodes the enjoyment for existing ones.

Ubisoft has obviously tried to curb toxic behavior through in-game reporting systems and automated bans, but these measures have had limited to no success. The persistence of toxicity continues to tarnish the game's reputation and diminish the overall player experience more than most other games.

3. Steep Learning Curve and Poor Onboarding

Siege is well known for its steep learning curve. The game’s complicated mechanics, operator abilities, and strategic design, make it challenging for newcomers like myself to grasp, but I don’t really have a problem with that. While a deep and complex game can be rewarding, Siege does little to ease new players into its demanding environment. The in-game tutorials felt inadequate, often failing to cover the nuances and strategies essential for actually doing good in real games.

This lack of proper onboarding leaves me feeling overwhelmed and outmatched, leading to frustration and a steep barrier to entry. Without proper guidance, many newcomers including myself give up before they have a chance to fully appreciate the game's intricacies.

4. Imbalance and Meta Issues

Balancing a game with so many unique operators and gadgets is a monumental task, no one is denying that, but Siege has still really struggled in this area. Certain operators  consistently feel more powerful or versatile than others, and more often than not this more powerful operators are the newer ones which cost more renown, leading to a skewed meta where the same characters feel like they are repeatedly chosen.

Ubisoft releases new operators often, but this often exacerbates the balance issues. New characters sometimes debut in an overpowered state, prompting backlash from the community and necessitating subsequent nerfs. This cycle of imbalance and adjustment can be frustrating for players who desire a stable and fair competitive environment.

5. Monotony and Lack of Content

Despite the frequent addition of new operators and maps, Siege really started feeling monotonous quick. The core gameplay loop remains largely unchanged, leading to a sense of repetitiveness. While the game offers a lot of maps and modes, the fundamental gameplay experience does not change significantly. This is especially frustrating when you look at how other games like overwatch have constant events and content updates that help keep it fresh.

Additionally, I feel that Ubisoft's focus on adding new operators detracts from the development of other types of content, such as new game modes or significant updates to existing maps. Even though they did not add a new operator this season there is still a perceived lack of content diversity that contributes to the feeling of monotony and limits the game's replayability.

6. Microtransactions and Monetization

I know that Siege is not the only game that is trying to squeeze ever cent out of its player base, but it still needs to be held accountable for its awful monetization practices. The game features numerous microtransactions, including cosmetic items, seasonal passes, and now a monthly subscription. While cosmetics do not impact gameplay, the high cost of these items is still extremely greedy.

The reliance on microtransactions creates a sense of ""pay-to-look-good,"" where players feel pressured to spend real money to access desirable content. This business model can be seen as exploitative, particularly when combined with the game's initial purchase price and the cost of seasonal passes.

7. Cheating and Exploits

Cheating is a huge issue in Siege. Despite Ubisoft's “efforts” to combat cheating through anti-cheat software and ban waves, cheaters continue to plague the game. Hacks and exploits, such as aimbots and wallhacks, give players an unfair advantage, undermining the integrity of the competitive experience.

The presence of cheaters can be incredibly demoralizing, particularly in ranked play where fair competition is paramount. The ongoing struggle to maintain a cheat-free environment detracts from the enjoyment and fairness of the game.

8. Unrealized Potential

Perhaps one of the most frustrating aspects of Siege is its unrealized potential. The game has a solid foundation with its unique blend of tactical gameplay, destructible environments, and operator abilities. However, the persistent issues mentioned above hinder the game from reaching its full potential.

I often lament what Siege could have been if not for its technical problems, toxic community, steep learning curve, balance issues, monotony, monetization practices, and cheating. The game’s potential for greatness is evident, but its execution falls short in many areas.

I have given siege a really fair chance. I bought it back in mid 2023 and I have really tried to enjoy it but given the problems that I have talked about in the short essay I really don’t think that I can play anymore. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1djvc2g/im_finally_done_with_siege/

##MANHUNT

Year 5 Season 3 ended with a shocking revelation, Rogue agent number one and sworn nemesis of The Division, Aaron Keener is alive. In her hunt for truth, Agent Kelso located him and decided to join forces with him.

The line between light and dark, agent and rogue, keeps blurring as we learned that Keener was working with Faye Lau to undermine the Black Tusk and neutralize the Hunter threat during the events of Warlords of New York.

Keener is coming to Washington, D.C. and he has sent us an invitation to parley, but first we will need to pass his twisted trials and prove our worth. An alliance with Keener and his Rogues could be the key to stopping Natalya Sokolova and the Black Tusk. But what will the cost be? 

Can Keener be trusted? Is the enemy of our enemy truly our friend?

##ONE ENDGAME

With Y6S1 First Rogue we are unifying the Division 2 and Warlords of New York DLC owners in One Endgame.

Players will be able to keep levelling their characters beyond 30 in the streets of Washington DC and reach the level 40 cap, without any additional purchase.

Upon reaching level 40, the endgame will be available to all agents. This includes all level 40 items implemented in the past years, Seasons and all their activities (Leagues, Global Events, Apparel Events, Manhunts - including the new Y6S1 First Rogue Manhunt), level 40 Game Modes (The Summit, Countdown) and the recently released Incursion, Paradise Lost.

Warlords of New York remains available as an additional purchase, offering exclusive story content, New York South Manhattan map and special gear.

265,1d50bpg,L-K-B-D,1717174391.0,What additional gameplay prone and crawling could bring to Splinter Cell ?,24,26,"Ubisoft recently said that the next Assassin's Creed game (Shadows) will have prone and crawling for the first time in the series. Before that this feature has already been integrated into the latest Ghost Recon games and you could for example [hide in the mud](https://youtu.be/o5p19E0SCq0?t=224) or [in the snow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5AuCW3ff0A). We also remember MGS V which had some cool proning [movements and controls](https://youtu.be/x4sCD0lRQ8I?t=2).

Therefore we can imagine that the Splinter Cell remake would also introduce prone and crawling for the first time in the series. And especially when [a developer interview from november 2022](https://x.com/SplinterCell/status/1596171972123181065) showed in the background a concept art of Sam using his gun while being in a prone position:

[Concept art from Ubisoft Toronto \(2022\)](https://preview.redd.it/3ksh8c6fis3d1.png?width=424&format=png&auto=webp&s=44657329986038bb240b1e23711389ad4ea30485)

**So according to you, what additional and useful gameplay prone and crawling could bring to Splinter Cell ?** I have some thoughts that I'm sharing right below but I'd love to read yours !

Obviously, it would be nice for Sam to be able to lie on his back and be able to use his weapons and throw his gadgets in a 360° range, and to hide behind small elements in the environment, or to hide in low grass or in snow (like in the ending cutscene of Double Agent v2). But there are some other situations in which I think it could be used or add some new elements to the gameplay, like:

* having a greater stability when shooting at a distance
* crawling under any vehicle, in a smooth way and without having to press a button prompt like in Double Agent v1
* crawling into river beds, and even being able to go below the surface during a few seconds and completely hide under the water
* having more complex laser sections
* having a rolling mechanic like in MGS. On top of that adding a smooth and seamless transition to the ledging animation could be nice. Just imagine crawling on a roof, there's an enemy coming in front of you so you just roll quickly towards the ledge on your right and Sam automatically grabs the ledge and hangs to it
* in a game mode or a difficulty mode where NPCs would be able to detect Sam's shadow, it could be useful to be able to prone to make your shadow as little as possible
* we could probably have some nice takedowns, like making an enemy fall on Sam while he's holding his knife up, instantly killing the NPC
* if Sam could go prone then the AI would also be able to go prone, making them harder to see and shoot during combat sequences

**Please post your opinions and ideas about this feature, and also share if you'd like to see it coming to Splinter Cell or not :)**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Splintercell/comments/1d50bpg/what_additional_gameplay_prone_and_crawling_could/
266,1c05ode,TommyRisotto,1712702659.0,Loving the new Guardians global event!,24,21,"The new changes to the Guardians global event now make it one of the best GEs imo. While you don't get the instant reload nor the stability/accuracy buff from Golden Bullet, you still get an insane RPM buff from killing the Guardian mob and stacking dmg buff from killing targets. And like Golden Bullet, getting kills refreshes the buff. Paired with Strikers, you absolutely shred through even Legendary-level elites! Thanks to the changes, Guardians is prob my #2 fav GE now, close behind Golden Bullet. Def recommend turning on the GE and leave it on!  Hopefully Ubisoft can get a fix soon for our Playstation brethren, so they can experience the fun as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1c05ode/loving_the_new_guardians_global_event/

&nbsp;

After Division Agents resecured stability in the White House, Agent Kelso returned to New York to ensure the Haven settlement was also secure. But while Agents were rescuing the civilians abducted by the Black Tusk, Kelso had gone missing. Meanwhile, The Division now faces the harsh reality that Hunters are among them, raising doubt and suspicion in both the White House and Castle settlements. Agents must now find Kelso, but as they retrace her steps, more truths will be uncovered, reopening some old wounds.

This time around we don’t have to rescue specific people, but we have to retrace Kelsos steps in New York. So, we have to visit the places where Kelso has been and find the clues that have been left behind at those locations.

###Cosmetic Bundles – Warlords of New York - Rogue Agents

In addition, new unique cosmetic bundles will be regularly added to the store. This time players will get the looks of Keener's squad of rogue agents from Warlords or New York. Each one will be made available as a unique outfit: Dragov, Conley, Kajika, Parnell, and rogue number one --- Aaron Keener himself.

##FAQs

###Should I start off at level 1 or level 30?

This question comes up frequently and it has a clear answer: 

If you play the game for the first time, it is best to start the campaign at level 1. You get a tutorial through the campaign and you get introduced to the different mechanics one at a time. Going through the regular progression also unlocks all story-related achievements and commendations. Warlords of New York continues the campaign once you have reached the level 30 endgame. 

&nbsp;

###What version should I buy?

If you are wondering what version of The Division 2 you need, this is an overview:

=> [Version](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/wiki/thedivision2/guides/endgame/wlny_editions#wiki_editions)

In essence, when you already have the game, you just need the Warlords of New York expansion. If you buy it for the first time, it is just a question if you also want the Year 1 Pass with the additional Classified Assignments or not.

## NEW ADDITIONS

### FULL SYNCHRONIZATION CHALLENGE

Do you think you've experienced everything Assassin's Creed Mirage has to offer? Our newest game mode Full Synchronization Challenge (a.k.a. permadeath) is the ultimate test of your assassin skills.

When enabled, Basim will desynchronize from the animus if he dies, or if he commits illegal actions (e.g. killing citizens, going outside of authorized map locations).

When Basim desynchronizes from the animus, instead of the usual desynchronized reload screen, a new display appears showing statistics of gameplay time, total amount of conflicts, cause of the death, number of enemies killed, assassin rank and difficulty chosen to play.

There are no second chances - your save file will be **permanently deleted**, so perfect your skills to keep Basim alive!

*Additional details:*

* You can enable the Full Synchronization Challenge when starting a new game from the title screen.
* Full Synchronization Challenge cannot be enabled or disabled when the game has started.
* **Cross-progression AND Cloud saves will be disabled when starting permadeath.**

### FULL SYNCHRONIZATION CHALLENGE REWARDS

* Unlock an emblem when you complete the game in **easy** mode.
* Unlock the emblem and Rayhan costume in **normal** mode.
* Unlock all the above and 6 new dyes for existing outfits (Initiate, Zanj Uprising, Abbasid Knight, Hidden Ones, Rostam, Bayek) when completed in **hard.** (Please note; dyes can only be applied to these specific outfits).

### NEW OUTFIT FEATURE

Added a new feature where players can now wear any costume they own as an outfit (Transmog).

### NEW EASTER EGG!

We added a surprise easter egg to the world, a new special assassin that you might meet *purr*using the streets. Be sure to snap a photo if you *meow*nage to find them! 

## BUG FIXING

### GENERAL

* Fixed visual issues on Basim's right arm when the player equipped the Bayek outfit or costume.

* Fixed an issue where the player could re-collect the Lost Books in New Game Plus when they previously collected them in their first walkthrough.
* **A Dance with Thieves**: Murjana's second clue is optional and isn't required to complete the quest. It will only show on the investigation board if the player interacts with the letter while Fuladh is in Harbiyah Bureau.

* **The Marked Coins**: Fixed an issue where the NPC ""The Hidden One"" levitated towards the roof when slightly ahead of the player.

##Project Resolve

=> [Summary Video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmePY26y33Y)

Introducing Project Resolve - a comprehensive update for The Division 2 aimed at improving player experience and laying the groundwork for future content. 

&nbsp;  

###Global Events Changes

These improvements aim to make Global Events more fun and engaging. The goal is to leverage the success of the Golden Bullet Global Event as a benchmark and apply it to make other Global Events equally enjoyable. The overall approach involves minimizing negative consequences and enhancing the positive outcomes when playing the Global Events, the way they are meant to be played.

&nbsp;

These are the essential changes that have the most impact: 

**Guardians**

* You can now damage guarded NPCs – so you can take out (for example) rushers even when the guardian is still active.

**Hollywood**

* Bigger explosions and you get the signature ammo directly delivered to your location. 
* This way you can chain the explosions with your Signature Weapon. 

**Polarity Switch**

* You only lose the stacks when you kill an NPC with the wrong polarity.
* When you kill an NPC with the right polity, the weapon is automatically reloaded. 
* This way, when you focus on the right polarity, you can chain the kills since you can stay in the flow and are not forced to switch the polarity with reload. 

**SHD Exposed**

*  No drastic changes – the pulse radius was increased and the damage numbers have been updated.

**Reanimated**

* The head-shot-kill explosion was increased; it does more damage and is easier to trigger.

&nbsp;

=> [Global Event Summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/wiki/thedivision2/guides/endgame/wony_globalevents)

&nbsp;

###Projects Changes

They have made changes and additions to completion conditions and rewards to make projects more interesting and worthwhile. The changes will affect the following Projects:

&nbsp;

*   Daily Projects
   * The rewards list now also includes 1 Exotic Component.
*   Weekly Projects, including Invasion and Weekly Legendary Mission
   * Rewards list now also includes 3 Exotic Components.
*   Season Pass Daily Projects
*   Daily and Weekly Dark Zone & Conflict Projects
*   Weekly Descent Project
*   Weekly Summit Project

&nbsp;

###Game Modes

**Descent**

* General Gameplay
   * Lowered the required heat necessary to reach the Nemesis. This will reduce the minimum loop at which Players can encounter Nemesis to 4 and the maximum loop to 9.
   * Decreased the reward requirements in Descent by 1-5 loops. Players will now receive more loot caches / rewards for completing the same number of loops as before.

&nbsp;

* NSA Store
   * Added caches within the NSA Tech store found outside the Descent entrance. 
   * Added Descent Outfits in the NSA Store - all 4 different color variants.
   * Added the “Vindicator” Exotic in the NSA store.

&nbsp;

* Talent Rotation
   * Added Talent pool rotations in Descent that update every 3 days. These pools have different thematic and consist of 35 talents and 6 exotic talents each. 
   * Descent Talents Pool rotation has its own menu where the current rotation and available talents can be checked. The button prompt for the menu can be found within the Descent entrance AR window.
   * The duration of the rotation and its name is now also displayed.

=> [Descent Summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/wiki/thedivision2/guides/activities/descent)

&nbsp;

**Summit**

The LVL 100 XP issue was fixed.

&nbsp;

**Stability**

Optimizations have been implemented in all three modes - Countdown, Descent, and Summit - leading to enhanced stability and performance overall.

&nbsp;

### Expertise Cost Reduction

Project Resolve makes Expertise upgrades more easily attainable to ensure that the costs of upgrading are in proportion to the benefits gained. The intention is to prioritize the player's time by implementing this change.

=> [New Expertise and Optimization Costs]( https://imgur.com/6iRiOa0)

=> [Expertise Summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/wiki/thedivision2/guides/endgame/expertise)

&nbsp;

### Optimization Update

* Players are now unable to optimize beyond the value stored in their Recalibration Library.
* The optimization upgrade steps have been modified so that players will no longer be required to pay the full price for an incomplete optimization step. 
   * **Example**: You have **+10% SMG Damage** in the Library and are trying to optimize an SMG that currently has **+9.7% SMG Damage**. Since the highest value in your library is **+10%**, you will only be able to upgrade by **+0.3% and** will only pay the material price for the **0.3%** portion instead of paying the full price of an upgrade step.

=> [Optimization Summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/wiki/thedivision2/guides/basics/optimization)

&nbsp;

### Weapon Balancing Changes

The balance pass aims to enhance the appeal of less popular weapons and make them more engaging for all Agents.

The changes made to standard weapons may have an impact on Named and Exotic weapons that are derived from them. However, to avoid unintentionally over-buffing Exotic and Named weapons, certain buffs may not carry over. While most weapons are expected to inherit the base weapon buffs, some may remain unchanged to maintain balance. 

Full list is in the patch notes.

&nbsp;

###Brand Set Balancing

The objective is to enhance the strength of the 2- and 3-piece Brand Set bonuses in order to reward players for committing to a specific Brand Set. They want to make the 3-piece bonus more enticing, while also making less utilized mechanics more relevant.

=> [The Brands](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/wiki/thedivision2/guides/equipment/brands#wiki_the_brands)

&nbsp;

###Gear Set Balancing

These Gear Sets also got a balance pass:

* **System Corruption** Geart Set
* **Hunter's Fury** Gear Set
* **Foundry Bulwark** Gear Set

&nbsp;

### Inventory Improvements

**Tinkering Menu**

=> [Tinkering Menu]( https://imgur.com/J4MQlxd)

There have been several improvements to the Inventory system. They’ve added a new menu called Tinkering, which combines the features of Optimization and Recalibration into one convenient location. This menu, along with the Expertise menu and the Talent/Attribute Library, now has a separate tab in the Inventory that can be accessed from anywhere, reducing the need to return to the Base of Operations. 

&nbsp;

*   Pressing \[M\] while nothing is highlighted opens the general Tinkering Menu.
*   Pressing \[M\] while a specific item is selected allows the player to make Tinkering operations directly on the highlighted item.

&nbsp;

**Send to Stash**

Additionally, they have introduced the option to directly send an item to the Stash, with a warning if the Stash is full. Furthermore, they have implemented a feature that displays the Stash item count when approaching it, eliminating the need to access it to check the inventory.

&nbsp;

### Quality of Life Updates

**Season Collectibles from Legacy Manhunts**

With TU20 you can replay the old seasons in the Legacy Manhunt menu and get all the collectibles that are assigned to the Manhunts by replaying the final mission. 

&nbsp;

**Open World Loot Crates Scale with Global Difficulty** 

Loot crates will now scale with the world difficulty, resulting in higher quality gear and improved stats across the board, particularly for Challenging and Heroic difficulties.

&nbsp;

**Instant Armor Kits** 

Additionally, they are introducing a new feature that allows players to instantly use an Armor kit to replenish 25% armor with a 5-second cooldown. This is in addition to the existing functionality of holding the button to replenish 100% armor.

&nbsp;

**Barbershop Update**

The Barbershop got new hair colors that you can use on your agent. 

&nbsp;

**SHD Health Bonus Cap**

Project Resolve introduces a cap on the SHD watch HP bonus at Level 2000 and an increase in the HP gain: 

*   LVL 1 to 1000: no changes.
*   LVL 1001 to 2000: changed HP gain from 0.3 to 30HP per level.
*   LVL 2001 and beyond: scavenging materials at each level.

These changes aim to enhance the gameplay experience and provide a more balanced progression system. 

=> [SHD Rank Summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/wiki/thedivision2/guides/endgame/wony_endgame#wiki_shd_levels)

&nbsp;

**Recalibrate Exotics**

All Exotic Weapons' third attribute will be reconfigurable.

&nbsp;

**Skill Mod Rework**

* To avoid duplicates that clutter the mod space needlessly, they want to make Skill Mods inventory management more efficient. Each bonus can only be owned once and the value of the roll updates when a better one is obtained by the player.
* When you pick up a better mod, you will also get materials from the deconstructed old one.

=> [Skill Mods ](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/wiki/thedivision2/guides/equipment/skills#wiki_skill_mods)

&nbsp;

**Stash Item Count**

=> [Image](https://imgur.com/7Zuz80g)

* You no longer need to open your stash to see the number of items, it gets displayed when you approach the stash.

&nbsp;

**Commendations**

* Added new Commendations for the Paradise Lost Incursion
* They will also add more new commendations to the game down the road.

&nbsp;

**Leaderboard Reset**

* Because of all the changes to the game, some – not all – leaderboards were wiped to start fresh and highlight the performance of the current players and remove players from the boards that profited from exploits and other game related issues. 
* They might do that on a regular basis down the road.

&nbsp;

These are among the reset leaderboards: 

*   Kenly College
*   Raids
*   Strongholds
*   Clan
*   Standard Solo
*   Standard Group
*   Invaded Solo
*   Invaded Group

&nbsp;
  
### Conflict Overhaul

**Remove Expertise and SHD Buff**

* To strengthen the identity of Conflict as the purest PvP experience available Project Resolve will improve the balancing for all players, regardless of the time they have invested in the game. Thus, all Agents joining Conflict will have their Expertise and SHD Watch bonuses removed.

&nbsp;

**Better Rewards**

* The caches that Agents can obtain in the mode will offer a greater quantity and improved quality of rewarded items.
* Significantly boosted XP gain to align with other game modes.

&nbsp;

=> [Conflict Summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/wiki/thedivision2/guides/activities/conflict)

&nbsp;

### Status Effects in PVP

**Status Effect Counters**

All the changes to Status Effects included in Project Resolve are focused on reducing their impact and introducing counterplays. The intention is to make Status Effects in PvP more manageable and provide Agents with additional options to counteract them. 

&nbsp;

*   Reduced severity of **immobilizing Status Effects** 
    *   **Ensnare/Riot Foam:** The player will receive a 10% damage reduction for incoming body shots. 
    *   **Shock:** The player will have slower movement and is prevented from shooting. _PVP only._
* **Burn**
   *   While burning, rolling in any direction will apply a bonus of 10% burn damage resistance for 5 seconds, up to a maximum of 30%.
   *   _Rolling 3 times maxes out the bonus._
* **Bleed**
   *   Not moving grants 10% bleed damage resistance for the duration of the effect.

&nbsp;

**Diminishing Returns**

Diminishing returns have been added for all Status Effects in PVP, categorized into Crowd Control (Shock, Ensnare, Blind) and Damage Over Time (Bleed, Burn, Poison). Diminishing Returns will not apply in PvE. Diminishing returns means that each subsequent application of the same category of Status Effect will have a reduced duration until full immunity is reached. 

&nbsp;

**Hazard Protection from Skills**

All repair skills (Mender seeker, Reinforcer Chem Launcher, Fixer Drone, Restorer Hive) now give a 50% hazard protection bonus for 5 seconds, only the first time that the agent comes in contact with that instance of the skill.

&nbsp;

**Status Effect Cleanses from Booster Hive**

*   Added Poison to the list of effects that the Booster Hive cleanses.
*   Boost duration now scales with tiers (from 5s to a maximum of 6.5s at skill tier 6).
*   Increased maximum range up to 50%.
*   Increased drone speed by 20%.

‌&nbsp;

**Disrupt changes from Sticky EMP**

*   Reduced EMP explosion damage in PvP.
*   Lower Skill Tier players will not apply Disrupt to higher Skill Tier players if the difference between them is bigger than 3 (same as jammer EMP).

&nbsp;

### Talent Balancing

The aim is to make certain Talents more viable for PVP and address some balancing issues. 

&nbsp;

**Description Updates**

* Sadist / Perfect Sadist
* Eyeless / Perfect Eyeless
* Ignited / Perfect Ignited
* Thunder Strike / Perfect Thunder Strike

&nbsp;

**Weapon Talent**

* Future Perfection 
* Perfect Preservation
* Swift (The Stinger)
* Thunder Strike / Perfect Thunder Strike
* Flatline / Perfect Flatline
* Big Game Hunter
* Breathe Free (Lady Death)
* [PvP Only] Actum Est (St. Elmo's Engine)
* [PvP Only] Fireworks Show (Festive Delivery)

&nbsp;

**Gear Talent**

* Intimidate / Perfect Intimidate
* Obliterate

&nbsp;

### Dark Zone Changes

Project Resolve introduces a more distinct contrast between invaded and uninvaded Dark Zones, allowing players to customize the intensity of their gameplay experience. The goal is to increase accessibility to the Dark Zone for a wider audience, while also providing a dedicated space for those seeking a more intense experience. 

&nbsp;

Here are the changes that Agents can expect in the non-invaded DZ:

*   The activation time for ""Going Rogue"" has been increased to 3 seconds from 0.75 seconds.
*   The duration of the first Rogue rank has been extended from 20 to 30 seconds.

Invaded Dark Zone remains unchanged

&nbsp;

After Division Agents resecured stability in the White House, Agent Kelso returned to New York to ensure the Haven settlement was also secure. But while Agents were rescuing the civilians abducted by the Black Tusk, Kelso had gone missing. Meanwhile, The Division now faces the harsh reality that Hunters are among them, raising doubt and suspicion in both the White House and Castle settlements. Agents must now find Kelso, but as they retrace her steps, more truths will be uncovered, reopening some old wounds.

This time around we don’t have to rescue specific people, but we have to retrace Kelsos steps in New York. So, we have to visit the places where Kelso has been and find the clues that have been left behind at those locations.

###Apparel Event – Veiled Tactics

When the event is active, you can earn Apparel Cache keys in game by levelling up your watch levels and unlocking the different items through caches.  Apparel Event keys for the Apparel Caches can be earned from the following sources: 1 free key granted to all players, SHD Levelling - one key every four SHD levels, direct purchase with Premium Credits, and, if you are a Year 5 Season 2 Premium Pass owner, you'll be granted 3 extra keys.

Veiled Tactics Apparel Event offers a collection of four new outfits for you to acquire, with an additional fifth outfit as a completion reward. The event revolves around the theme of Camouflage, catering to those Agents who appreciate the art of concealing oneself.

##PTS Results

From the PTS Phase 2 Dev Comments: 

###Behind You Talent

*   Starting with TU20 the Behind You Talent will be exclusive to Rifle and MMR weapons. This change was made to align with the intended design, as its wider availability on the PTS was unintentional and considered a bug. We decided to limit the use of talent to MMR and Rifles only due to the Talent being too strong paired with some other weapons.

&nbsp;

###Amplified Damage

*   Additionally, starting with TU20 release, the Amplified Damage will decrease from 40% to 15% for the Behind you and from 60% to 20% for Perfectly Behind You. The adjustment in value is intended to align with the original intention of the Damage being Increased but has now been modified to be Amplified. This change is not a nerf, but rather a refinement to align with the intended behavior. The current implementation of the talent creates an imbalance, particularly in how Amplified Damage calculates damage compared to Weapon Damage. The initial values of 40%/60% were suitable for Weapon damage but not compatible with Amplified Damage. To address this, we have adjusted the values to ensure that Amplified Damage functions as intended.

&nbsp;

###**Ortiz Assault Interface Talent**

*   Starting with TU20 release, the Amplified Damage will decrease from 75% to 40% for highlighted body sections.

&nbsp;

###**Rugged Gauntlets – Exotic Gloves felt underwhelming**

* Initially, the intention was for the Iron Grip Talent to give stability and accuracy bonus. However, a bug caused the accuracy bonus to malfunction, resulting in the gloves feeling underpowered on PTS. We have since resolved this issue, and the gloves should now function as originally intended, with both stability and accuracy bonuses.

&nbsp;

###**Hunter’s Fury**

*  The 3-piece bonus was changed from +100% health on kill to +50% health on kill. This adjustment is implemented to maintain a sense of balance, considering the introduction of additional Health bonuses on Brand Sets. As a result, the viability of health on kill is also enhanced.

&nbsp;

##Project Resolve

The whole Project Resolve was already covered with the [previous stream]( https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/18g3v9y/the_division_2_special_report_project_resolve/) – but here are the highlights. 

As mentioned, the goal was to improve the stability of the game and add a lot of quality-of-life features to the game to prepare for the following updates. 

The team was very excited to go through the backlog and fix all the lingering issues and bugs and that also shows in the amount of bugfixes that are being added with the TU20 Update. 

&nbsp;

###Gear Lock

The feedback has been very clear that they need to find another way to achieve the result that they are trying to get. Something that is less impactful on the rhythm of the game.

So, this change will not drop with TU20, but it will still be added to Conflict with 20.1. You will only be able to switch gear within the spawn areas. 

They will go back to the drawing board with this feature, and look into other ways to get the intended result. 

&nbsp;

###Conflict

* Better rewards and more XP gain
* Removal of Expertise and SHD Rank buff from the game mode

The goal is to have the purest PVP experience in Conflict. That is why they remove the SHD Rank and Expertise buffs and move the focus from the gear towards skill. Basically, that a 30h player should be able to face a 1000h player and still have a chance. 

&nbsp;

###Dark Zone

* The Rogue activation timer has been changed to 3s for the regular Dark Zone, it is still 0.75s for the Invaded Dark Zone. The goal is to make Rogue an intentional choice that you need to commit to. 
* The first Rogue rank has an increased duration of 30 seconds. 

&nbsp;

###Expertise

* The upgrade costs have been lowered significantly. 

=> [New Expertise Costs]( https://imgur.com/6iRiOa0)

&nbsp;

###New Tinkering Menu in the Inventory

=> [Tinkering Menu]( https://imgur.com/J4MQlxd)

The goal is to move the whole optimization part of the gameplay from the Base of Operation into the inventory so that you can do that on the go and you don’t have to return to the BOO to process / recalibrate or optimize your equipment.

&nbsp;

###Global Events

The goal is to make them more fun and less punishing.

&nbsp;

These are the essential changes that have the most impact: 

**Guardians**

* You can now damage guarded NPCs – so you can take out (for example) rushers even when the guardian is still active.

**Hollywood**

* Bigger explosions and you get the signature ammo directly delivered to your location. 
* This way you can chain the explosions with your Signature Weapon. 

**Polarity Switch**

* You only lose the stacks when you kill an NPC with the wrong polarity.
* When you kill an NPC with the right polity, the weapon is automatically reloaded. 
* This way, when you focus on the right polarity, you can chain the kills since you can stay in the flow and are not forced to switch the polarity with reload. 

**SHD Exposed**

*  No drastic changes – the pulse radius was increased and the damage numbers have been updated.

**Reanimated**

* The head-shot-kill explosion was increased; it does more damage and is easier to trigger.

&nbsp;

###Descent

* Talent pool rotation is being added to the game mode. Every three days you get a set of 35 Talents and 6 exotic talents. 
* The goal is to increase the chance that you get the talent you actually want to counter the ever increasing talent pool.
* You can buy the 4 outfits and the new Exotic Weapon to the NSA Store.
* More Rewards for the loops.
* You can reach the Nemesis faster. 

&nbsp;

###Quality of Life Features

**Skill Mods**

* You can only have one mod with the same bonus, so when you pick up a better stat, the mod will be updated with the better value. This way the mod-management will be a lot more streamlined and you no longer need to have a lot of mods with the same stat in the inventory. 
* When you pick up a better mod, you will also get materials from the deconstructed old one. 

&nbsp;

**Stash Item Count**

=> [Image](https://imgur.com/7Zuz80g)

* You no longer need to open your stash to see the number of items, it gets displayed when you approach the stash. 

&nbsp;

**New Textiles Vendor**

=> [Vendor]( https://imgur.com/TEgk5RS)

* With TU 20.1 there will be a new vendor that allows you to buy caches with textiles.
* It will be a “Hidden Vendor” like Cassie Mendoza that you have to find in the open world.
* The items will be limited, so you will not be able to buy an endless amount of Cashes. 

&nbsp;

##Q&A

**New Leaderboards**

Adding new leaderboards is not off the table at this point. 

&nbsp;

**Recruiter Outfit Return**

The Recruiter outfit will not return any time soon, but maybe down the road. 

&nbsp;

**Vindicator as Open World Drop**

No, you can only get the Exotic as item from the NSA Store.

&nbsp;

**Grenade type Selection**

They remain locked to the Specializations, but they might look into that down the road.

&nbsp;

**Legendary for Open World**

There are no plans to add legendary difficulty to the open world. But they look into the overall difficulty of the game. 

&nbsp;

**Reroll the third attribute of Exotics**

All Exotic Weapons' third attribute will be reconfigurable with TU 20.

&nbsp;

**More Legendary Missions**

At the moment only Strongholds have legendary difficulty and all of them are covered. But they keep that in mind for the discussion about the overall difficulty of the game. 

&nbsp;

**Sharing Skill Mods**

Since the Skill mods are automatically added and processed in the inventory, you will not be able to share the skill mods. 

&nbsp;

**Blueprints from older Seasons**

Named blueprints have been added to the Descent Game Mode and the goal is to add the Season blueprint to the overall blueprint pool.

After Division Agents resecured stability in the White House, Agent Kelso returned to New York to ensure the Haven settlement was also secure. But while Agents were rescuing the civilians abducted by the Black Tusk, Kelso had gone missing. Meanwhile, The Division now faces the harsh reality that Hunters are among them, raising doubt and suspicion in both the White House and Castle settlements. Agents must now find Kelso, but as they retrace her steps, more truths will be uncovered, reopening some old wounds.

&nbsp;

[[TD2] Year 5 Season 3: Vanguard img - 11](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2e3TSl7lQYehLC1GZqkTei/d69c77d4bcb35f3b7a6ba2cadc6ef670/11._New_Expertise_Cost.jpg)

&nbsp;

#### **Recalibration and Optimization**

*   Merged both functions into one tab - Tinkering
*   Players are now unable to optimize beyond the value stored in their Recalibration Library.
*   The optimization upgrade steps have been modified so that players will no longer be required to pay the full price for an incomplete optimization step.
    *   **Example**: You have **+10% SMG Damage** in the Library and are trying to optimize an SMG that currently has **+9.7% SMG Damage**. Since the highest value in your library is **+10%**, you will only be able to upgrade by **+0.3% and** will only pay the material price for the **0.3%** portion instead of paying the full price of an upgrade step.

&nbsp;

#### **Recalibration Library**

*   It has received UI improvements and can be accessed from the Tinkering Station. 

&nbsp;

#### **Armor kits**

*   Ability to instantly use an armor kit to replenish 25% armor (5 second cooldown), in addition to holding the button to replenish 100%.

&nbsp;

#### **Skill Mods**

*   Implemented a duplicate removal system for Skill Mods.
    *   When a superior Skill Mod is acquired, it will automatically replace the existing one, resulting in the deconstruction of the inferior mod.
    *   Similarly, if an inferior Skill Mod is obtained, it will be automatically deconstructed.
    *   In both scenarios, the deconstructed Skill Mod will yield the corresponding amount of printer filament.

&nbsp;

### GAME MODES

#### **Descent**

*   Lowered the required heat necessary to reach the Nemesis. This will reduce the minimum loop at which Players can encounter Nemesis to 4 and the maximum loop to 9.
*   Decreased the reward requirements in Descent by 1-5 loops. Players will now receive more loot caches / rewards for completing the same number of loops as before.
*   Added Exotic, Named & Reconstructed caches within the NSA Tech store found outside the Descent entrance.
*   Added Descent Outfits in the NSA Store - all 4 different color variants.
*   Added Talent pool rotations in Descent that update every 3 days. These pools have different thematic and consist of 35 talents and 6 exotic talents each.

*   Fixed the issue that allowed keeping the increased magazine size from the True Patriot Gear Set even after swapping loadouts.
*   Fixed the issue that allowed glitching through a ladder when entering cover directly behind it.

&nbsp;

##Key Areas

&nbsp;

With the decision to make longer seasons (4 months now) they had the time and room to work on quality-of-life features. While new content is always great, Project Resolve has the goal to fix the foundations of the game before new things get added to the mix.

   * 50% hazard protection for 5 seconds has been added once per target for all Repair Skills
* Conflict reward buffs / add spawn camping protection
* Overall Weapon Balancing
   * Buff the under performing weapons
   * Goal is to have more options in the game to make more weapons viable

##Finetuning on PTS

The goal is to iron out all these changes over the different PTS phases:

&nbsp;

* PTS Preload: December 14th

##Roadmap Update

=> [Roadmap]( https://i.imgur.com/Zz4W66B.jpg)

Because of the focus on Project Resolve, the overall roadmap had to be reworked and things that were planned earlier were pushed back: 

* Once Project Resolve and Vanguard is released in February, they go back to work on the Seasonal Content
* The previously announced Story DLC will be released in 2025 with the goal to achieve the best quality possible. 

&nbsp;

##Q&A

**Will the cheaters be addressed**

They are always improving cheat detection and are banning players on a daily basis. It is not perfect and are working on improvements. They are also looking into Cronusmax and see what they can do about it. Keep reporting players with videos and report them to Ubisoft Support so that they can be processed. 

&nbsp;

**Is the Invaded Dark Zone going to be more rewarding**

Yes, that is the goal

&nbsp;

**Are the SHD Rank and Expertise removed from the Dark Zone**

No that is only the case for Conflict. In the Dark Zone you should have that buff from the Expertise. But they are open for discussions. 

&nbsp;

**Will there be new Skills**

They are currently looking into improving what we currently have before adding new Skills. 

&nbsp;

**New Incursion / Raid**

Tell them what you want

&nbsp;

**Changes to Specialization**

No changes to Specialization in this update. Maybe later down the road. 

&nbsp;

**Next Gen Update**

Not planned at the moment

&nbsp;

**Release Date of Project Resolve**

February

Introducing Project Resolve - a comprehensive update for The Division 2 aimed at improving player experience and laying the groundwork for future content. With your feedback in mind, our focus is on enhancing the game's health and stability.

Starting with a Public Test this week and followed by another in January, we will release the update in full alongside Year 5 Season 3 in February for all Division 2 players. From addressing thousands of bugs to enhancing PVP, we're leaving no stone unturned.

These proposed changes are not final and are intended to provide you with a preview of the work being done in Project Resolve.

#PVE IMPROVEMENTS

##GLOBAL EVENTS

These improvements aim to make Global Events more fun and engaging. Our goal is to leverage the success of the Golden Bullet Global Event as a benchmark and apply it to make other Global Events equally enjoyable. Our overall approach involves minimizing negative consequences and enhancing the positive outcomes when playing the Global Events, the way they are meant to be played.

The following Global Events will be impacted by the changes: Guardians, Polarity Switch, Hollywood, SHD Exposed, and Reanimated.

&nbsp;

###**Guardians**

• When killing an angel, in addition to restoring armor to full, 50% of total armor is added as bonus armor.  
• Increased damage buff from 30% to 50%.  
• Minions now receive 15% of incoming damage instead of being invincible.  
• Damage buff duration increased from 10 to 15 seconds.

###**Polarity Switch**

• “Damaging enemy of different color removes polarity stacks"" changed to ""killing enemy of different color removes polarity stacks"".  
• Max stacks increased from 5 to 4.  
• Damage bonus per stack increased from 20% to 25%.  
• Killing an enemy of the right polarity reloads the player's weapons.

###**Hollywood**

• Triple explosion range.  
• Triple explosion damage.  
• Fixed explosion VFX.  
• Explosions generate signature ammo and grenades at the player's location.

###**SHD Exposed**

• 10x melee damage for the first melee hit after reaching 100% exposed.  
• Stacks are acquired 50% faster.  
• Double pulse radius.  
• Players take 65% damage instead of 115% from pulsed enemies. Non-pulsed enemies still deal full damage.

###**Reanimated**

• Triple explosion range.  
• The explosion damage increased by 50%.  
• Enemy headshot weakness increased by 50%.

&nbsp;

##PROJECTS

We have made a few changes and additions to completion conditions and rewards to make projects more interesting and worthwhile. The changes will affect the following Projects:

*   Daily Projects
*   Weekly Projects, including Invasion and Weekly Legendary Mission
*   Season Pass Daily Projects
*   Daily and Weekly Dark Zone & Conflict Projects
*   Weekly Descent Project
*   Weekly Summit Project

&nbsp;

##GAME MODES

We are planning to introduce a Talent rotation feature in Descent and shorten run lengths to expedite encounters with the Nemesis.

Summit fans can anticipate the resolution of the LVL 100 XP issue.

Optimizations have been implemented in all three modes - Countdown, Descent, and Summit - leading to enhanced stability and performance overall.

&nbsp;

##EXPERTISE

Project Resolve makes Expertise upgrades more easily attainable to ensure that the costs of upgrading are in proportion to the benefits gained. Our intention is to prioritize the player's time by implementing this change.

[[TD2] Project Resolve - New Expertise and Optimization Costs](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/3TYuQkvkrpGLze6rjWhJG/4b0f2b061ce866be6ffa724976345e8e/2._New_Expertise_and_Optimization_Costs.jpg)

&nbsp;

##WEAPONS BALANCING

The general buff balance pass aims to enhance the appeal of less popular weapons and make them more engaging for all Agents.

The changes made to standard weapons may have an impact on Named and Exotic weapons that are derived from them. However, to avoid unintentionally over-buffing Exotic and Named weapons, certain buffs may not carry over. While most weapons are expected to inherit the base weapon buffs, some may remain unchanged to maintain balance. Additionally, all Exotic Weapons' third attribute will be reconfigurable.

&nbsp;

##GEAR BALANCING

Our objective is to enhance the strength of the 2- and 3-piece Brand Set bonuses in order to reward players for committing to a specific Brand Set. We want to make the 3-piece bonus more enticing, while also making less utilized mechanics more relevant.

&nbsp;

##NEW FEATURES

We have made several improvements to the Inventory system. We have added a new menu called Tinkering, which combines the features of Optimization and Recalibration into one convenient location. This menu, along with the Expertise menu and the Talent/Attribute Library, now has a separate tab in the Inventory that can be accessed from anywhere, reducing the need to return to the Base of Operations. We will also adjust the Optimization costs to reduce the expenses associated with upgrades. 
 
Additionally, we have introduced the option to directly send an item to the Stash, with a warning if the Stash is full. Furthermore, we have implemented a feature that displays the Stash item count when approaching it, eliminating the need to access it to check the inventory.

&nbsp;

##QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATES

We have made some significant changes to the loot crate system in the open world. Loot crates will now scale with the world difficulty, resulting in higher quality gear and improved stats across the board, particularly for Challenging and Heroic difficulties.

Additionally, we are introducing a new feature that allows players to instantly use an Armor kit to replenish 25% armor with a 5-second cooldown. This is in addition to the existing functionality of holding the button to replenish 100% armor.

Furthermore, we will be implementing a cap on the SHD watch HP bonus at Level 2000 and an increase in the HP gain. From Level 1 to 1000, players will gain 30 HP per level and 1 Perk point. From Level 1001 to 2000, the HP gain remains at 30 HP per level. Beyond Level 2000, there will be no additional HP bonuses. These changes aim to enhance the gameplay experience and provide a more balanced progression system.

To avoid duplicates that clutter the mod space needlessly, we want to make Skill Mods inventory management more efficient. Each bonus can only be owned once and the value of the roll updates when a better one is obtained by the player.

&nbsp;
  
***
#PVP IMPROVEMENTS

&nbsp;

##CONFLICT

Our objective is to strengthen the identity of Conflict as the purest PvP experience available in The Division 2 by making it more balanced for all players, regardless of the time they have invested in the game. Thus, all Agents joining Conflict will have their Expertise and SHD Watch bonuses removed.

The caches that Agents can obtain in the mode will offer a greater quantity and improved quality of rewarded items.

Changes affecting the Spawn Area include the plan to add turrets to all spawn points to prevent spawn camping and forbid equipped items and loadouts from being changed while in Conflict. Loadout switching and individual pieces of gear will be allowed only once per spawn.

&nbsp;

##STATUS EFFECTS

Status Effects adjustments prioritize the PVP experience.

All the changes to Status Effects included in Project Resolve are focused on reducing their impact and introducing counterplays. The intention is to make Status Effects in PvP more manageable and provide Agents with additional options to counteract them. Even though these changes primarily target the PvP experience, we will also monitor their impact on PvE.

Diminishing returns have been added for all Status Effects in PVP, categorized into Crowd Control (Shock, Ensnare, Blind) and Damage Over Time (Bleed, Burn, Poison). Diminishing Returns will not apply in PvE.

Diminishing returns means that each subsequent application of the same category of Status Effect will have a reduced duration until full immunity is reached.

Plague of the Outcasts in PvP is also affected by diminishing returns, with stacks being halved upon transfer.

Additionally, the severity of immobilizing Status Effects has been reduced, 50% hazard protection for 5 seconds has been added once per target for all Repair Skills, Poison has been included in the list of effects that the Booster Hive cleanses, and boost duration now scales with skill tiers, ranging from 5 seconds to a maximum of 6.5 seconds at skill tier 6.

&nbsp;

##TALENTS

We aim to make certain Talents more viable for PVP and address some balancing issues. Agents can expect the following Talents to get a revision both in PVP and PVE:

&nbsp;

### Weapon Talents

*   Doctor Home
*   Actum Est **_PvP Only_**
*   Future Perfection
*   Swift
*   Thunder Strike and Perfect Thunder Strike
*   Big Game Hunter
*   Breathe Free
*   Perfect Preservation
*   Flatline and Perfect Flatline

&nbsp;

### Gear Talents

*   Glass Cannon and Perfect Glass Cannon
*   Intimidate and Perfect Intimidate
*   Makeshift Repairs
*   Process Refinery
*   Improved Materials
*   Obliterate:
*   Unbreakable and Perfect Unbreakable **_PvP Only_**

&nbsp;

##DARK ZONE

Project Resolve introduces a more distinct contrast between invaded and uninvaded Dark Zones, allowing players to customize the intensity of their gameplay experience. Our goal is to increase accessibility to the Dark Zone for a wider audience, while also providing a dedicated space for those seeking a more intense experience. 

&nbsp;

Here are the changes that Agents can expect in the non-invaded DZ:

*   The activation time for ""Going Rogue"" has been increased to 5 seconds from 0.75 seconds.
*   The duration of the first Rogue rank has been extended from 20 to 30 seconds.
*   Players with the Rogue status will be unable to switch loadouts or individual gear pieces for the duration of the Rogue status.

&nbsp;

We also forbid equipped items and loadouts from being changed while in the Dark Zone. Loadout switching and individual pieces of gear will be allowed only once per spawn.

&nbsp;

##FIXES

Among the numerous fixes included in Project Resolve, here are a few that PVP players would appreciate the most:

*   The issue that allowed agents to aim from cover without being seen and exposed to enemy fire with the Striker Ballistic Shield active while using the C79 scope has been fixed.
*   The issue that allowed agents to shoot using any scope while their hitbox is fully protected by props when using any shield has been addressed.
*   The issue that allowed agents to retain the increased magazine size from the True Patriot Gear Set even after swapping loadouts has been resolved.
*   Lastly, the issue that allowed glitching through a ladder when entering cover directly behind it has been fixed.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

After recovering Mari Singh and the first set of hostages, Agents will turn their focus on locating the remaining people missing in order to learn more about Natalya Sokolova's plans against The Division.

Agents must find the rest of the hostages. Among them is Vikram Malik, who was taken by the Black Tusk who once worked with Sokolova. Rescuing Malik means learning more about what she is scheming. As part of their rescue mission, The Division must hunt down and confront The Recruiter, the prime target in Season 2. Taking down The Recruiter will help uncover the secrets behind who and why he is recruiting.

Additionally, as each hostage is rescued, Agents will see new upgrades to areas of The Castle as part of the settlement's ongoing rebuild.

##INCURSION

Incursions are Back! - A staple in Tom Clancy's The Division, the four-player Incursion missions are now available in The Division 2, with high-skill endgame content that will feature unique mechanics and challenging boss encounters. 

[ [TD2] Year 5 Season 2: Puppeteers - 4. Incursion Key art](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4gFFOcClubUiyPY1WhvTJR/996e50ab258145bbc152c17b657f7703/4._Incursion_key_art.jpg)

The first Incursion - titled ""Paradise Lost"" - will have four Division agents work to liberate the burning Meret Estate Settlement, which has been taken over by the Cleaners. The Division must locate and rescue the hidden survivors and their leader - Mackenzie Meret - but will need to battle tough enemies along the way. 

Up to four agents are required to participate in Incursions. Each week an Incursion is cleared will result in the reward of an exotic item (this may include a 10% chance drop for unique Exotic SMG Ouroboros only available in Incursion). Incursions are the ultimate team challenge. That's why Agents will need to employ optimal gear loadouts, strategy and collaboration in order to succeed. 

&nbsp; 

**Ouroboros**  

Exotic SMG

&nbsp;

**Talent Rule them All**  
  
When the agent has a **Status Effect** applied to them, **50%** of the ammo in their next magazine will apply the **same Status Effect to their targets.**  
  
This effect will only occur **during combat.**

Please note that you can only get the Incursion completion reward weekly. However, replaying the Incursion will still grant your boss loot drops with a 1% chance to drop the Ouroboros Exotic SMG (1% for each boss).

280,133ytrk,unskilledDrahim,1682878265.0,The Division Year 5 - hopes and fears,14,20,"Fellow Agents,

first of all - I'm not a native speaker, so pardon me for my not so perfect english.

Like many agents I was following the huge information drop on division day with excitement. I don't really care much about the two new additions to the franchise, namely Heartland and Resurgence. So in this thread I'll be trying to express my somewhat mixed feelings and expectations on the division 2 year 5.

I really love the Division 2 and played it for quite some time on PS4, made a longer break and came back to Division 2 on PC in february 2023 and got about 300h on my playtime clock. Since I've returned to the game, I've tried to get lots of people from my gaming bubble into playing the game, but the current state of the game kept everyone from playing it for more than a week into the lategame.

Main reasons were in order of mentioning / severity:

1. Server stability, especially on countdown (and countdown performance in general)
2. Random DELTA errors and game freezings with no other chance than to ALT+F4
3. Minor, but annoying issues like:  
3.1) Why they have to click the \[Overwrite\] button for loadouts 100 times till it REALLY saves changes  
3.2) No ability to ""ping"" / ""mark"" items / enemies on screen for communicaiton  
3.3) No Crossplay
4. Grinding for Mods is a real pain in the \*\*\*
5. Not being able to unlock all crafting recipes if a downer
6. Items left on the ground are gone for good (extra frustration on crashes)
7. DZ loot should provide DZ loot with priority instead of giving you PVE stuff

So, I was talking to them after Division day and asked them about joining back with the announced changes on the roadmap.

None. NONE. Was even slightly positive that Division 2 will be able to handle the above mentioned issues (especially no 1 + 2), but will simply put the new stuff ontop which will most likely bring even more issues.

I really hope, that they're wrong and year 5 will be awesome for all agents, but for some reason there's those voices of my friends, that fire up the same doubts...

What do you think? Do you guys think that Ubisoft, Massive and Co. will be able to fix stuff and give us a fun and better gaming experience with year 5?",https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/133ytrk/the_division_year_5_hopes_and_fears/
281,1301619,JoJet223,1682546714.0,Neckless Mask Glitch,4,15,"As some of you may already be aware. As of the release of Manhunt Target: ""Cursed"", there is a visual glitch that occurs with apparel masks that cover the head, face, and neck (with the exception of the ""Black Balaclava"", for some reason). Specifically. The glitch essentially removes the neck portion of the mask, leaving you with a frankly stubby looking mask.

Regardless of how it looks. This glitch seemingly only occurs with certain apparel shirts, and isn't affected by any other category of apparel (I.e. neckwear).

Such examples in where the glitch doesn't occur being, when wearing the:
- JTF Shirt
- SWAT Shirt
- Explorer Shirt
and
- The entirety of the ""Fairview Crew"", ""Explorers"", ""DC Services"", and ""Recreation"" apparel collections.

Now, firstly. It should be noted that my finding are not extensive, and do not cover how the glitch affects the female player model. So, by all means, feel free to do some tests of your own.

Secondly. I am far too stupid and tired to file a formal bug report. So if you feel it appropriate, and/or so inclined to do so, be my guest.

Side Note: At least they gave the ""Paragon"" mask a neck. That's something, at least.

EDIT: I am well aware that there are more pressing concerns at hand that should be addressed first. And that something as minute as ""mY mAsK iS tOo SmAlL"" is trite when compared to such.

However, Ubisoft/Massive is probably more than well aware of such bigger issues, and is probably trying their best to resolves said issues in the presumable messy clusterfuck of code spaghetti that is this game.

As such, I figured that while they wrack their brains trying to solves things like server stability and practical bugs, they could try taking a crack at a few of the smaller issues in between.",https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1301619/neckless_mask_glitch/
282,12skhgd,Orca_Oreo,1681961388.0,"Thoughts on Taking a Season Off to Improve Game Health Akin to ""Operation Health""",4,4,"As the title says, how would people feel if the devs took a season or even half a season off in order to work on overall game health?

What do I mean by this? 

Just a bunch of quality of life (QoL) changes, improvements, or additions. Online Server health. Maybe work on changes to anti-cheat. There is a lot they can look into. 

I'm suggesting this, because as much as some like to meme on it, Operation Health did a lot to improve the overall health of Ubisoft's other game, Rainbow Six Siege, a few years back. And recently I saw that R6 is receiving even more QoL updates for console players.

I think taking time to focus on a refresh like this to the game could do it wonders. Make use of the Testing Grounds, take surveys on things we think the game can benefit from (in terms of User Interface and User Experience). 

None of this is to say that there aren't other pressing issues. Or whether they have the resources to do this. 

It's just a suggestion in which I think would be very good for the game and as a result, the players.

Share your thoughts :)

Edits/Responses:

- They already did this - True. And the game is in a much better state compared to launch. 
But is there no room for further improvements? If it is believed the devs would fail to implement good changes from this, then sure. Forget I even mentioned it.

- Bad idea because Operation Health fixed nothing. - Operation health added good stability and hitbox updates. Sure it brought some bugs that had to be later hammered out, but it is generally agreed that it did more good than bad. However I digress, I could have used a different phrase instead of ""Operation Health."" Sorry I mentioned it. But it should be obvious that I do not literally mean ""Do the same thing again."" I want further server stability and QoL updates to UI + UX. Capcom is updating + modernizing the servers to even some of their older fighting games. 

To further elaborate. Just today there were several posts of people ranting or questioning about the servers. There are well documented scripters. People are upset at rage quitting. Lag switchers are becoming more and more common. Some are mad at the MMR system. I saw a few posts a while back of people wanting more reticle color options. Some ideas for mask effect changes. General things that can be improved upon if given the proper resources.

Again, whether Ubisoft would succeed is a whole other point, and I understand that side of it. I am, of course, hoping for the best outcome if it were to happen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/12skhgd/thoughts_on_taking_a_season_off_to_improve_game/

#MANHUNT

=> [Targets](https://i.imgur.com/V8FMIQ2.png)

With the Black Tusk and True Sons alliance solidified and Captain Lewis's troops joining the Division, new battle lines are drawn.

Natalya Sokolova has come out of the shadows and is taking a more active and visible role leading the Black Tusk on more aggressive campaigns across Washington.

Additionally, Hunters have been more active in the capital and a new recruit emerges to help decipher encrypted Hunter Drone files.

Season 11 follows the story of the latest target to find - Zachary ""Stovepipe"" Beattie, an Explosive Ordinance Disposal Specialist. Tasked to destroy explosives, Stovepipe began collecting schematics and prototypes for increasingly unstable Improvised Explosive Devices. This caught the eye of the Black Tusk, who eventually recruited Stovepipe as one of their own.

The Division is now tasked to collect intel for Stovepipe's whereabouts. To do that, we must find and neutralize four targets (Charles ""Chunks"" Crawford, Lieutenant Bantam, Mort ""Cursed"" Kellogg and Beatrice ""Auntie"" Kaplan). Taking down these four targets is the key to locating Stovepipe. Good luck, Agents!

285,1gcxaqe,LeoPines_12,1729983658.0,"Prince of Persia The Lost Crown did NOT underperform, Ubisoft had crazy expectations",252,111,"

As we know, a sequel to Prince of Persia The Lost Crown got cancelled and the team behind it disolved and put to work on other titles such as a Rayman remake. The reasoning behind was that the game underperformed as it didn't greet Ubisoft's expectations.

And here's the thing, it's not that the game underperformed, it's that Ubisoft's expectations were INSANE.

According to sources, Prince of Persia The Lost Crown sold 1 million copies during the past 9 months, which let's be real, are not bad sales for a metroidvania, let alone from a game that not only was on a Ubisoft suscription day one on PC and Xbox, but also came from a franchise that had been dead for 14 years.

So why did Prince of Persia The Lost Crown did not greet Ubisoft expectations?

Because, according to Tom Henderson, they expected Metroid Dread's total numbers....on release date.

They expected Prince of Persia The Lost Crown to sell 3 million copies on release.

So you understand why this is so crazy and unreallistic, the three most successful metroidvanias of the decade in sales were:

Metroid Dread: 3 million copies in 2 years

Hollow Knight: 3 million copies in 2 years

Ori franchise: 10 million copies in almost 9 years combining TWO games, Blind Forest + Will of the Wisps

They expected Prince of Persia The Lost Crown to sell on release the same ammount the top games of the genre took 2 fricking years to achieve. Heck, they expected the game to sell almost DOUBLE of what their latest hit, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, did, cause on release week, it sold 1,8 million, and yet they expected 3 millions, from a metroidvania no less. That's asking the game to sell the same as a God of War or Spider-Man videogame, which is beyond insane.

So, yeah, the game didn't flop, it's Ubisoft who definitely have no idea the market or the public they sold the game to. Hopefully in another year or so, the game will reach those 3 millions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PrinceOfPersia/comments/1gcxaqe/prince_of_persia_the_lost_crown_did_not/

#Shades of Red

Year 6 Season 2: Shades of Red is marking the start of a new seasonal journey. With Aaron Keener in custody at the White House, he aims to strike a deal with The Division. Before Agents can learn what he knows, they have to secure the other members of Keener's team, starting with Theo Parnell.

&nbsp;

***
##SEASONS 2.0

###Seasonal Journey

=> [Seasonal Journey]( https://i.imgur.com/cqARuXm.png)

The new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season's content.

The entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.

&nbsp;

###Seasonal Modifiers

=> [Season Modifiers]( https://i.imgur.com/XfduRhn.png)

The Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience: 

*   **Global Modifiers** set the overall theme of the season and are active at all times while the system is enabled, affecting the core gameplay loop. 
    *   This season, the theme is ""range."" The Global Modifier, ""Point Blank,"" grants a bonus damage based on distance from enemies. 
*   **Active Modifiers** function like ""ultimate"" abilities, giving your character a short burst of power. 
    *   Players can choose from a selection of Active Modifiers, but only one can be equipped at a time. This season, they manipulate the range zones set by the Global Modifier. 
*   **Passive Modifiers** work in conjunction with the Global Modifier, adding extra bonuses. 
    *   Players can equip up to three Passive Modifiers simultaneously. In the first season, these modifiers provide additional benefits based on the range zones from the Global Modifier. 
*   **Hostile Modifiers:** These represent how the enemies adapt to your new abilities. 
    *   As players progress through the season, enemies will gradually gain new abilities linked to specific enemy types, forcing you to use the Global, Passive, and Active Modifiers strategically to counter them. 

The modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges. 

&nbsp;

###Priority Objectives

The Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.

Players can choose from three objectives, selecting one based on limited information such as duration, reward category, and mission type. Once a selection is made, it is locked in, and the full details of the objective and its rewards will be revealed.

If none of the objectives appeal to the player, the system allows for rerolls and has an Abandon Objective feature. Players can earn reroll points by completing Priority Objectives, with a maximum of three rerolls stored at any time.

There is no limit to the number of Priority Objectives a player can complete, and rewards include XP, Season Pass XP, items, resources, and passive modifier unlocks.  

&nbsp;

###Manhunt Scouts

=> [Parnell Manhunt](https://i.imgur.com/khEGjlR.jpeg)

Manhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.

Each week, players can tackle a Scout, which consists of three different activities. These activities will vary, and players must solve a small riddle to complete each one. Activities should be completed in order, and once all three are finished, players will receive the Scout Reward.

Once all activities in a Scout are completed, players will receive a bigger reward, including a unique collectible. However, new Scouts cannot be accessed until the current one is completed.

By the end of the season, completing all Scouts unlocks the Manhunt Climax Mission, and finishing that unlocks the Master Climax Mission, so make sure to stay on track each week.

&nbsp;

291,1gd97qw,sarmadwarraich,1730029838.0,"Is it just me, or has Ubisoft reused Child Models like a lot?",5,17,"Odyssey has this kid I've seen so many times in quests, from the main game to the DLCs. It makes me wonder if Ubisoft just ran out of character variety despite how long the game is!

Edit:

I disagree with most of you, but I realize I should have been more specific about what kind of repetition bothers me in *Odyssey*, particularly when it comes to quest design. My issue isn't with repeated character models in the open world, no one expects to scrutinize the faces of characters while riding a horse, driving, or biking. It's impractical and, honestly, not what most players focus on. 

What I’m talking about is the noticeable reuse of characters in quests. For example, there's a child who appears across multiple quests, not only in the base game but also in the DLCs. This type of repetition pulls you out of the story and affects immersion, which is why I feel Ubisoft should have handled it better because it’s not about background characters; it’s about specific quest driven interactions that become less engaging when the same character models are reused.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AssassinsCreedOdyssey/comments/1gd97qw/is_it_just_me_or_has_ubisoft_reused_child_models/
292,1gchjil,Theologydebate,1729936207.0,There was so much setting up for Sargons story in a sequel yet we will sadly never get it.,53,9,"Spoilers for anyone who hasn't 100% the lore and the game. 

  
It is very much hinted that Sargon is the true Prince not Ghassan throughout the game and virtually confirmed by the time you finished the side quests. 

The prophecy hints at there being three princes this is clearly Vahram, Ghassan and Sargon. 

The doctor that was kicked out of the capital says he held Sargon as a baby before he could even remember and that Ghassan is not the child of Thomyris rather the child was swapped. Incidentally the person that Ghassan looks the most similar to is Anahita facial feature wise, when Fariba first meets Sargon she says 'I don't see many princes around here' also king Darius says to Sargon 'I smell the blood of a traitor' hinting that Sargon carries Thomyris blood.

God there was so much set up for an interesting sequel, 3 princes with the young Vahram, Ghassan and Sargon the lore the environment of Persia and everything was so damn cool but now we get nothing out of it. The team that worked so hard for this great game and arguably Ubisofts most talented developers get punished for poor management. 

Firstly this game was hardly advertised completely overshaded by the crapshoot that was AC mirage, also the delayed steam release plus $50 pricing really didn't do this game any favors I am not sure what they were expecting from a metroidvania in terms of sales but their expectations were clearly wrong. I strongly believe had this been $30-35 and released on steam from day one we would be seeing a sequel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PrinceOfPersia/comments/1gchjil/there_was_so_much_setting_up_for_sargons_story_in/

294,1gc28be,SoSneeKee,1729883697.0,Ubisoft Support Experience,10,8,"Hello, everyone.  2 years ago, I signed up for a Referral Program for Rainbow Six Siege. If the program were completed, you would be granted an in-game skin.  I completed the program according to all parameters, but never received any reward. The program showed completed on my user.  However, the progression was stuck for multiple of my participants I recruited. No matter how many games we played, the progress bar would not increase. After filing a support case, which was subsequently escalated to an internal team, it was confirmed that the progress tracking was bugged and thus failed to deliver the reward that I earned.  At the time, ubisoft support said there is nothing they could do, as there was no way for them to generate a skin for my account.  I dropped it because I believed that this made sense at the time. Fast forward 2 years to now.  With the inception of Rainbow6 marketplace, players can obtain skins from past events, challenges, etc, so long as they have enough r6 currency to pay for it.  Thus, I opened a new support case in hopes Ubisoft Support could either provide me with the r6 credits necessary to buy the skin, or buy the skin themselves and help transfer it to my account.  Below is a record of my experience with this issue.

After referencing previous cases and once again providing screenshots that the progression tracking was bugged, an Ubi rep escalated my case again.  The result they found was that the tracking was indeed bugged at the time, which is why I never got the skin.  Thus, I explained that this skin is now available on marketplace and requested the allotted amount of credits so I may purchase it at no expense to myself.  For reference, this skin is now worth $700USD+/88k  r6 credits+ due to its rarity.  This is why I cannot just buy it myself. Ubisoft support once again told me there is nothing they could do, which I find hard to believe.  How is a support team that assists with r6 credit issues unable to issue r6 credits? They then said ""sorry about that!"" and closed my case.  Naturally, I reopened the case and asked to speak with someone who COULD help me.  Well, support continued to stonewall me, citing that the rewards program was over by the time I opened a case.  This is true, but their own website says that rewards may take 24hr+ to appear on the account, so how could I have known there was a bug before that 24hr time period?  I pushed this issue with support and continued to reopen the case, but they have now resorted to copying/pasting canned responses and bullying me with the threat of support strikes due to ""inappropriate behavior on this case."" As far as I can tell, the only inappropriate thing I've done here is ask Ubisoft Support to do their jobs. I have meticulously provided every shred of detail and evidence they requested regarding this issue.  I had to bother real-life friends to reinstall this game to help me with this referral program two years ago, then bother them again for screenshots proving it is bugged.  Ubisoft does not seem to care and refuses to provide me with a fake, in-game currency to resolve this issue.  It is a very simple solution in my eyes, but they claim there is nothing anyone at the company can do.

I have played this game since day 1 early access, with 9 years of purchase history illustrating my support of this game. My intention is not to generate malice towards Ubi Support, it is to give you some insight on what the ubisoft support experience is like: ""Yes we see proof of the issue, yes the issue was our fault, no we will not do anything about it whatsoever. Sorry you are out $700+, just let it slide this time, okay?"" I have included my entire correspondence with support regarding this matter so you may independently decide who is at fault here.  Please do not harass ubi representatives below.  I have censored the individual rep names to prevent this. It is extremely frustrating that they cannot facilitate such a simple request. I just want the damn skin that I earned.

295,1gavvqk,SenVetis,1729749869.0,This community is Evil. BP Trial/Rant?,3,10,"This past Season. I bought my first ever shop purchase, the Battlepass. For what it's worth, this is how well it's gone since it began.
Let's just say, It's unpredictable, yet still Chaotic as usual.

• How many times will I see & hear constant racism?

• Why does everyone expect you do get 10+ Kills minimum to speak, when they beg for Callouts?

• Why do people rally against 1 player, Berate the life out of them, because they had a bad game?

• Why do people act like Elitists, screeching about the wrong things, while blaming whoever they place their anger on?

• Why must people Team kill a Player who has the Battlepass? Geeze, Go back to banning them then. I'd rather be alive and Play.

• Why can't Seige players behave?

• Why are Seige players the only breed of Human, to ever be Offensive for fun?

• Is everyone abusing Shields and Exploits now?

• Why is 80% of the playerbase, Crazy? Not ""Haha"" crazy, but actually lost their minds? I haven't seen a lobby, not talk about Sex or Drugs in weeks.

• Appearantly, not having a Mic is Greifing, So I got reported for it on one match by 3 people.

• I also got reported, for someone else having a 4 squad. So yes, I was reported for being solo.

• I got reported Thrice by a 2 man squad, for being ""Handicapped"" then ""Black"" soon after ""American""

• Fourth match I got reported for not getting any kills. Yet I was the only player reinforcing, Droning, Pinging, destroying gadgets, etc. As my teammates refused any of the work, + constantly rushed + Called me ""Psycho"" for wanting less angles.

• Why is this game, innately stressful?

• Turned on Voice chat for the first time in 9 years. a friend said they'd pay me $5if i did. Will genuinely wait another 15 years before turning it on again. Yikes.

• am I just the Unluckiest Seige player ever?

• I hope the Doktor's curse gets cured. Man is that mode frustrating. Fun, but damn.

• I hope trapping a person under a desk is bannable In Doktor's curse.

• what the hell is a ""Gyatt"" ? And why the hell am I going to get smoked by one, because I went Amaru?

• who the hell is Carlos??? A new meme?

• Does nobody know how to use Ying? I swear, Imma go blind IRL with how many times my teammates hit me with a Candela.

• Teamwork and Cordination don't exist.

• After about a few days of the update going live, I finally got some good matches in. Only to be met with -134RP, as my teammates were cheating. Can I never win, even when I do win?

• My reputation went from Esteemed to Disruptive, this Season. I've never once had it drop this low. Great. I haven't changed anything.

• Will I forever be stuck in Copper? I barely have enough time to play as it is. It's hard out here for a Solo only player, but man these people make it so much harder.

• I was told to basically Harm myself, because I Got spawn peeked twice from different locations, as the enemy was not pinged outside.

• I've had about 2 Decent matches thus far. No drama, actual people with self respect, and could play to play. Not treat it like a Job, or Asset to show off.

[Final words]
Honestly. Even the Battlepass isn't worth the money, let alone any serious investment into this game anymore. Memberships are a Complete Scam to profit on what is left of the game's popularity, to help Ubisoft's bottom line float before they hit bankruptcy. 
I rarely ever buy extra content at all, unless it holds it's worth. There is very little to praise here. The only noteworthy thing, is me finally being able to unlock the last operator. I could've grinded months for, without spending $10.
I don't think I'll be buying the battlepass again.
Why buy it, when other games give back enough premium currency to continue the Battlepass for the Next season? 600 Credits back, is an Insult.

This is absolutely insane , how desensitized people are to death threats , It's incredibly vile and disgusting , especially over mundane topics like video game discussion. 

It's obviously a empty threat , but it's distressing nonetheless , WHAT THE HELL is going on with this sub?  Anti-Woke sentiments in comments , constant ubisoft slandering and unrelated discourse , it's just sad. 

Pathetic 

Edit: ""no need to make a post about it"" oh sorry , I didn't get the memo that it was just the causal Saturday where we throw death threats at each other. Sorry for taking up 1kb of space with my post on the internet and bothering you about this tiny issue. 


Edit 2: I woke up fully expecting to see more messages telling me I’m being ""soft"" and dismissing the situation as just the internet being the internet. To my surprise, I received so many heartwarming responses from people who truly understood how serious this is. Death threats, even if fake, are inhumane and insensitive. The more we ignore and normalize them, the more they’ll continue to happen.

I want to thank everyone for their kind responses—I didn’t expect such support, especially when you usually get bullied for being ""soft."" I’m very proud of this community 🙏 , thanks ya""ll

298,1g6f4g7,vzb227,1729248435.0,"Why is it, that lately all the skins are unbelievably hideous?",394,70,"I'm an old player, I started playing at skull rain. and I know that a lot has changed, which is normal for any game that's been around this long. I've always preferred the REAL tactical, or at least tacticool looks, which of course is just a matter of taste, but it really fits ( seemed to fit) the game better than all the cartoon looks. So I was already shedding tears at Pizza Mozzie, but at least it was a well done look, it didn't fit the game at all, but at least I didn't get visual brain cancer when I looked at it. When they introduced battlepass, it started off strong, with clothes that matched the game and characters.

https://preview.redd.it/g4whn1fcuhvd1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=b00e99a3bbc1a4908279f5c3bc06741648a4dc9b

And then over time it started to loosen up, and clothes that were less meaningful but still showed quality work started to appear.

But in the meantime, the worst period of randomly re-purposed clothes started, the ""fuck it, let's put all sorts of mismatched but at least ugly colours and shapes on the basic clothes"" period.

[The F is this?](https://preview.redd.it/seiya0xluhvd1.png?width=434&format=png&auto=webp&s=96f53863da912ef81cb34a81c3f8d7f48381cd76)

In the current battlepass, there is only a single 3D skin, and even that is just a headgear, everything else is worthless garbage. 

[What is it even trying to represent? It doesn't look like anything](https://preview.redd.it/7a16u8zpuhvd1.png?width=398&format=png&auto=webp&s=9baf0108942cc61ace41dda3533763561a875985)

Not to mention the unnecessary backgrounds and operator cards that fill the battlepasses. And it's not about ""grown ass man crying about having historically incorrect motifs in his unrealistic game"", it's just that all these mismatch clothes are ugly and lazy. I've done my fair share of 3d modeling and texture application, and while it's not an easy task, I think a triple A, excuse me, ""Quadruple A"" studio should bring it up a level, because right now these skins look like a cheap AI just randomly throwing colors on top of each other and then putting it into the battlepass. But I ask you, is it worth it? I understand that probably 80% of the money from the battlepass goes into C suit pockets, but wouldn't it be more worth it for them to make outfits that people want and might actually spend money on? I am a grown man with enough spending money and with very poor financial decisions. Without thinking, I would spend a lot of money on (otherwise pointless) things like good looking skins. But Ubisoft doesn't seem to want my money. Especially as they are going bankrupt after the many ""Quadruple A"" failures of the last few years. I don't know what I want with this post, and I know that there are many things in the game that need more urgent improvement, but if Ubisoft can't even keep the milking cow part of the game going, what do we expect from them?

Or am I living in a totally different world and people like what they're putting in the game these days?

I used to be a huge fan of Ubisoft games and stopped buying anything from them around 2017.  
Since the very first AC and Farcry2 down to AC:Odyssey. Recently it got myself thinking ""Why did I lost all interest about Ubisoft AAA games ?""  
  
One word sums it all for me: **Surprise.** Or more accuratly, lack of it.

Everytime Ubisoft makes a new AAA I am almost confident it's going to be an Open World action RPG, with map unlocking by going to ""towers"".  
I used to really like that, spent many hours and they are quite fun game even the new ones I am sure, but I just feel like I played way too much of this gameplay loop to keep buying more of it.

I would expect that from the same IP, but I feel like Farcry, AC, Breakpoint, etc all have the same ""feel"" with a different map and main gameplay mechanic (guns, swords etc). But they all ""feel"" the same imo.

Think of the changes between Farcry 1 (I know Ubi is not the dev), Farcry 2 and Farcry 3. All thoose game were very different and caught me by surprise back then. Farcry 4 and 5 all left more or less a twist on FC3.

To sum up, I am an adult now, and I don't have much free time to play like before, and I don't feel like spending that time playing the ""same game"" (yes, this is an exaggeration of my feeling) over and over.

I don't know if orthers quite old folks have the same feeling as I do.

And I wish on the AAA space, Ubi creatives had more freedom like they ocasionnally showcase on smaller titles.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1g3d8oo/why_i_dont_buy_ubisoft_games_anymore/

Note: No FromSoftware Games discounted, no Stellar Blade. Not a lot of horror games but that should change soon. Halloween PSN sale should launch Oct. 23.

**PSN Deal of the Week:** [**Lies of P (-40$, $41.99)**](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/eff78812-7d8a-4871-935d-71626db857fe/1)

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

* **NBA 2K25 (-30%, $48.99)** – Literally the only basketball game in town. If you like basketball, the NBA, you pretty much only have this as your lone choice. Not a bad entry, but be prepared for gargantuan patches.
* **Madden NFL 25 (-35%, $45.49)** – Same as with the NBA 2K series, this is the only NFL game on consoles.
* **EA Sports MVP Bundle: Madden NFL 25 + College Football 25 (-25%, $112.49)** – Don’t play football games, but based on reviews, College Football is the superior title. If you’re planning on picking both up, this is the first time it’s on sale.
* **Destiny 2: The Final Shape (-40%, $29.99)** – Doesn’t go on sale often. The latest expansion for Destiny 2.
* **GTA 5 (-50%, $19.99)** – PS4 version is $5 less. This is the lowest it’ll go, so if you’re one of the handful that still doesn’t own this, here’s your chance to line Rockstar’s coffers.
* **Hogwarts Legacy (-70%, $20.99)** – PS4 version is a few bucks less, but this is the version to get. At that price, this should be an impulse buy unless you hate wizards, witches or casting spells. Prepare to make a name for yourself as the youngest wizard with the highest killcount in history.
* **Star Wars Jedi Survivor (-60%, $27.99)** – PS4 version surprisingly costs more. This is the version to get. Souls but with a Jedi flavor. Better than the first one in almost every way, and Cal can run properly here. Third game in development, so this is a good time to get into the franchise.
* **It Takes Two (-75%, $9.99)** – Goes on sale almost every other week. Definitely worth it, but just bear in mind you need a co-op partner to play this,
* **Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered (-50%, $24.99)** – Rarely goes on sale, and this isn’t a bad price at all. If you haven’t played this franchise yet, now might be a good start.
* **Cyberpunk 2077 (-40%, $29.99)** – Rocky launch, but now in a stable state. This is what CDPR envisioned for the game. Definitely worth a buy now.
* **Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC (-15%, $25.49)** – Jampacked with content. If you’re done with the main story, then pick this up.
* **Red Dead Redemption 2(-67%, $19.79)** – Even if you’re not a fan of Westerns, this is still a must-play. Amazing story, gameplay and loads of Easter eggs. Actually prefer this over GTA5.
* **Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart (-58%, $29.39)** – Amazing platformer, loads of weapons to use. Has that rift mechanic that’s only possible on PS5. Give this a shot.
* **Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League (-80%, $13.99)** – The lowest I’ve seen this on PSN. Might be heading to PS Plus soon? It’s worth a try at that price, but depends on how much you like these type of games. Just be mindful that support should be ceasing soon.
* *Mortal Kombat 11 (-50%, $24.99)* – Possibly the lowest I’ve seen it on PSN so far. Your dose of violence, and latest Khaos Reigns content drop was just released and brings Animalities.
* **Avatar Frontiers of Pandora (-50%, $34.99)** – Might be the lowest it’s been on PSN without a bundle. Ubisoft’s formula but with an Avatar coating. Better than expected.
* **Still Wakes the Deep (-33%, $23.44)** – Fairly new. Have this but haven’t started yet. Surprised to see it here this fast.
* **Cuphead (-30%, $13.99)** – DLC is also on sale. Gorgeous visuals, tight controls but hard as hell.
* **F1 24 (-50%, $34.99)** – Latest F1 game from Codemasters. If you’re a fan, then this is a good buy.
* **The Last of Us Part 1 Digital Deluxe (-38%, $49.59)** – Just in case you haven’t played this, still a bit high.
* **WWE 2K24 (-50%, $49.99)** – Free this month for PS+, solid wrestling game and still getting DLCs.
* **Skull and Bones (-60%, $27.99)** – Unsure how well this turned out, but apparently there’s enough players to support its seasonal content.
* **Witcher 3 (-75%, $9.99)** – Super low price, and this is one of my all-time fave games. Fantastic side quests, meaty experience all around. Once you get past the floaty controls/combat, and once it clicks, it’s one hell of an experience. Expansion is also on sale and worth the price.
* **Battlefield 2042 (-$85%, $10.49)** – Worth it at that price. Game is in a much better state now than before.
* **AC Valhalla (-75%, $14.99)** – Assassin’s Creed Vikings! Insane amount of content, though overstays its welcome a bit.
* **Borderlands 3 (-90%, $5.99)** – Looter shooter but not live service. Insane action, and a steal at that price.
* **Earth Defense Force 6 (-20%, $47.99)** – If you dig these types of games, might be worth a pickup.
* **The Outlast Trials (-33%, $33.49)** – Multiplayer-focused horror game. Still getting lots of support.
* **GTA The Trilogy (-50%, $29.99)** – Unsure how performance is nowadays. Three games in one in case you want more GTA gaming before GTA6 drops.
* **Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy (-60%, $15.99)** – Crash platforming. Harder than it looks.
* **Mafia Trilogy (-75%, $14.99)** – Three Mafia games in one. Definitely not a bad deal, and there’s a new one on the way.
* **Star Wars Battlefront 2 (-70%, $5.99)** – Definitely worth the price. No content support incoming, but servers still up and someone said here previously that there’s no shortage of players. Fun to smash people around playing as your favorite Star Wars character.
* **LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga (-75%, $14.99)** – Star Wars adventure with Lego humor. Fun to play with kids or your partner.
* **Payday 3 (-60%, $15.99)** – Lowest I’ve seen this on PSN. Not sure if worth it now, but still getting loads of support.
* **Horizon Burning Shores (-50%, $9.99)** – First time I’ve seen this on sale. In case you want more for the game, then this DLC should scratch that itch.
* **Powerwash Simulator (-30%, $17.49)** – Doesn’t go on sale often. Surprisingly fun and getting regular support.
* **Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order (-75%, $9.99)** – If you’re planning on playing the trilogy, then this is your starting point. Lots of backtracking and Cal runs like he has crap in his pants that will never be OK.
* **Dead by Daylight Gold Edition (-40%,$41.99)** – Heavily supported, and DLCs are also on sale. Asymmetrical horror game for those who want something different.
* **Metro Saga Bundle (-85%, $8.99)** – Three games from the Metro franchise at a discounted rate.
* **Far Cry 6 (-75%, $14.99)** – Solid first-person campaign, and stars Giancarlo Esposito as the baddie.
* **Detroit Become Human (-50%, $9.99)** – More of an interactive movie than a game, but still solid. If you haven’t played Quantic’s games, it’s like Supermassive’s titles.
* **Midnight Suns (-75%, $17.49)** – Strategy with Marvel characters. Surprisingly fun even without MCU likenesses, and has solid length and depth.
* **Pacific Drive (-40%, $17.99)** – First-person driving survival game that’s still getting a lot of support.
* **Divinity Original Sin 2 (-65%, $20.99)** – Larian’s breakout hit. If you want your RPGs deep and long.
* **Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition (-20%, $15.99) –** First time this is on sale. If you ever wanted to play the cult classic, then this is the newest way of doing so. You might finish it in time for the sequel which should be coming any day now…
* **Persona 3 Reload Digital Deluxe Edition (-40%, $47.99) –** If you’re looking to play Persona 3, then this is it. Just got it last DLC drop this September as well.
* **System Shock (-40%, $23.99)** – Remake of a classic. SHODAN!
* **For Honor (-85%, $4.49)** – Multiplayer action game but more melee focused. Still getting loads of support after all these years.
* **Flintlock Siege of Dawn (-25%, $29.99)** – AA action game that didn’t sell well. Might be worth a look? Surely will go down in price more in a few months though.
* **Sifu (-60%, $15.99)** – Beat-’em-up but with more modern mechanics. Neat aging system for life, and harder than expected. Fun when you know what you’re doing.
* **Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 Turbocharged (-75%, $12.49)** -Still getting support. If you like your racing games more arcade-y than sim.
* **Hi-Fi Rush (-40%, $17.99)** – Tango’s last game before leaving Microsoft. JP style action-adventure. GOTY contender as well.
* **Mass Effect Legendary Edition (-85%, $8.99)** – Will never not recommend this. Probably my fave RPG trilogy of all-time. You can get your money’s worth with just the first game, but to have your decisions carry over until the last one? Yean, BioWare at their peak!
* **LA Noire (-50%, $19.99)** – Still priced high for an old game. Amazing visuals and makes you feel like a detective.
* **Back 4 Blood (-90%, $5.99)** – Support has ended but still fun if you can round up friends for co-op.
* **Need for Speed Unbound (-85%, $10.49)** – Still getting support somewhat. Arcade racing and has a less serious take on the franchise. Controls feel a bit floaty for me.
* **Banishers Ghosts of New Eden (-30%, $41.99)** – Criminally underrated game. Not AAA, but certain aspects of it do feel AAA. Combat is ists weakest link but it has a lot of content, good story and loads of secrets.
* **Tomb Raider I-III Remastered (-50%, $14.99)** – The old Tomb Raider games but with added sheen. Prepare for pixelated Lara and lots of mindless jumping while shooting.
* **Gotham Knights (-80%, $13.99)** – Underperformed but still fun. At that price, might be worth jumping into it just to test out the combos you can pull off since each character has their own moveset.
* **Lords of the Fallen (-50%, $34.99)** – The reboot. Sequel is in development and the studio pushed out a ton of new features and whatnot.
* **Crash Bandicoot Bundle: N. Sane Trilogy + CTR Nitro-Fueled (-65%, $26.24) –** Crash overload! Platforming and kart racing in a bundle.
* **Titanfall 2 (-75%, $4.99)** – One of the best FPS’ ever made. Play the campaign and jump into the multiplayer to get melted by sweats.
* **Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes (-35%, $32.49)** – Old-school RPG that surprisingly sold and reviewed well. Still getting support and this is the first time it’s on sale on PSN if I’m not mistaken.
* **Shadow of the Tomb Raider (-80%, $3.99)** – Didn’t finish it, but it’s a solid third-person action game. At that price? Yeah, definitely worth a shot.
* **Alone in the Dark (-30%, $41.99)** – Nota successful remake, but not a bad one either. It’s OK. Combat is nothing special and graphics won’t blow anyone away. Ambience is fine, and worth a look for horror fans.
* **A Plague Tale Bundle (-60%, $31.99)** – Don’t play if you get scared of rats, but this is a solid two games and story is well done.
* **Control – (-80%, $7.99)** – Remedy’s pure action game. In the same universe as Alan Wake. This includes the DLCs as well.
* **Hell Let Loose (-40%, $35.99)** – Era multiplayer FPS that’s still getting a lot of support from the devs.
* **The Division 2 Ultimate (-75%, $14.99)** – Fun especially with friends. Includes Warlords of NY expansion. Still getting support and getting new story DLC next year.
* **The Order 1886 (-50%, $9.99)** – Super short but sweet. Loved this when it was released. Amazing visuals then. Shame we won’t see what happens to the tale.
* **Evil West (-60%, $23.99)** – Vampire action game. AA fare but not bad at all. Expect jank and some unpolished visuals but could do worse than this.
* **Cult of the Lamb Cultist Edition (-50%, $14.99)** – Still getting supported. Fun and surprisingly deep. Who knew it was so much fun to have your own cult.
* **Nioh Collection (-58%, $29.39) –** Team Nnja’s Souls game. Hard as nails though, but lots of fans swear how good these games are.
* **Tomb Raider Definitive (-80%, $3.99)** – The first game in the new Tomb Raider trilogy. Solid action games.
* **Rise of the Tomb Raider (-80%, $5.99)** – You can literally get all three games for less than $15.
* **Kena Bridge of Spirits (-60%, $15.99)** – Made waves before. Fun adventure game. Has you collecting hats.
* **Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade (-42%, $3.79)** – If you haven’t played this yet, go get started. Wil make you understand why FF7 is one of the most revered games of all-time.
* **Mega Man X Legacy Collection (-60%, $7.99)** – Includes Mega Man X1-X4. Solid titles from the 32-bit era.
* **LOTR Gollum (-85%, $8.99)** – Lowest I’ve ever seen it on PSN. Promised patches never came. Still not worth it. Buy it if you want to torture your friends.
* **Zombie Army 4 (-90%, $4.99)** – From Rebellion. Content support has ended, but this is a surprisingly fun shooter.
* **Returnal Digital Deluxe (-50%, $39.99)** – Housemarque’s first AAA title. Fun, but might not be everyone’s cup of tea.
* **Outriders Complete  (-35%, $19.49)** – Criminally underrated. Not live service but plays like one. Includes story expansion. Play with friends and you will have a ball trying on different builds.
* **Star Wars Squadrons (-80%, $7.99)** – Support has ended but the most recent game where we can dogfight with Star Wars ships.
* **Anthem (-85%, $2.99)** – Lacks content, but at that price? Might be worth to play through the campaign. Fantastic feeling of flight.
* **Prey (-80%, $5.99)** – Arkane’s finest work according to some.
* **Quantum Error (-50%, $14.99)** – Might get a deeper discount for Halloween. Janky survival horror.
* **Dredge Complete Edition (-20%, $31.59)** – Horror fishing game. Yes, you read that right. Still getting loads of support.
* **Dishonored Death of the Outsider Bundle (-80%, $11.99)** – Arkane’s finest work? Maybe the most popular.

Not a lot of games in this sale, and you can check the full list to know what's available.

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is at from $79.99 to 54.39 for a limited time.

**Recommendations:**

* **GTA 5 - (67%, $19.79)** - For maybe the 2-3 people that still doesn't own this, now's your chance, as it doesn't get lower than this. Perhaps if GTA 6 is nearing launch maybe it will? But do you want to wait that long?
* **WWE 2K24 (-50%, $59.99)** - This game is free on PS Plus for October. If you aren't a member of PS Plus, then yeah, this is a solid wrestling game which has DLCs on the way.
* **Hogwarts Legacy Digital Deluxe (-70%, $23.99)** - Fun game regardless if you're a Harry Potter fan or not. No co-op or multiplayer of any kind but it lets you live the dream of becoming a mass murdering machine like Voldemort.
* **The Crew Motorfest (-60%, $27.99)** - Still getting support to this day. If you want a more arcade-y racing game.
* **AC Mirage (-50%, $24.99**) - Last year's Assassin's Creed game. Might not have made as big of a thud than Valhalla, but sitting at a generally favorable score at [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/assassins-creed-mirage/).
* **Red Dead Redemption 2 (-70%, $29.99)** - Some might not believe or like it, but this is even better than GTA 5. Fantastic story, engrossing side missions and loads of secrets. You can kill of racist mobs, get anal raped, encounter a vampire and more!
* **Madden 25 (-35%, $64.99)** - Your yearly NFL sim. Can't say if it's good or not since I'm not a football fan but if you're thinking of getting this one, then here you go.
* **Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League (-80%, $19.99)** - Season 3 just launched, but can't really say if this is worth it, since chances are, this will be on PS+ soon?!
* **Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (-55%, $40.49)** - Follow up to the Fallen Order, and better in almost every way. Cal doesn't run around like he has poop in his pants, backtracking issue has been more or less resolved. There's a third one on the way, so if you played the first one, then go pick this one up.
* **Borderlands 3 Next Level Bundle (-90%, $6.99)** - Includes a crapload of DLC and whatnot. Loads of Borderlands stuff are on sale, which fans might wnat to check out. This is well worth the purchase for those looking for some co-op loot action, and there's a free PS5 upgrade available as well.
* **A Way Out (-80%, $5.99)** - Usually on sale alongside It Takes Two, so no rush in getting it. Remember: this is a mandatory co-op game, so if you don't have anyone to play this with, don't bother.
* **Avatar Frontiers of Pandora (-50%, $39.99)** - Ubisoft open word in Avatar! All kidding aside, better than expected. The Gold Edition which includes the DLCs are also on sale.
* **Hi-Fi Rush Deluxe (-40%, $23.99)** - Tango's last game for Microsoft. GOTY contender and generally a different beast than what we usually get. Worth a pick up, but YouTube it first since the aesthetics, etc. might not be a fit for what you're looking for.
* **Midnight Suns (-75%, $19.99)** - Strategy Marvel game. Fun, good length and challenging. Not MCU but proves Marvel franchise can work in almost any genre as long as done right.
* **LEGO Star Wars Skywalker Saga Deluxe Edition (-75%, $17.49)** - Lighthearted Star Wars game you can play with friends or your kids. Familiar LEGO gameplay so expect loads of humor.
* **Mafia 3 Definitive Edition (--75%, $7.49)** - Period GTA but with a better story. There's a new one out next year, so if you want to get on-board this might be the time. Mafia 2 is also on sale for the same price.
* **AC Valhalla (-60%, $15.99)** - Viking Creed! Good action game, but be prepared to sink a lot of time into this.
* **Red Dead Redemption + RDR2 Bundle (-45%, $54.99)** - Not sure about RDR1 performance, but from a gameplay standpoint, should still hold up somewhat.
* **Gotham Knights (-80%, $17.99)** - Support has ended but the game is technically complete. Bat Family are the stars here and you can pull off some insane combos. Might be a bit repetitive, but not a bad game.
* **Back 4 Blood (-90%, $8.99)** - Zombie co-op FPS! Fun with friends. Support has ended, but servers are still up.
* **Alien Isolation The Collection (-85%, $5.99)** - Horror done with the Aliens franchise. Don't expect Resident Evil action, but loads of tense moments. Pick it up if you dig horror games.
* **XCOM 2 Collection (-90%, $9.99)** - Strategy game featuring guns, aliens and did I say strategy?! Not an easy game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fw64n3/psn_store_weekend_offer_sale_for_oct_4_launched/

Deliberations come after fall in game developer’s share price

Tencent, Guillemot family hold minority stakes in French firm

Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Ubisoft Entertainment SA’s founding Guillemot family are considering options including a potential buyout of the French video game developer after it lost more than half its market value this year, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Chinese tech company and Guillemot Brothers Ltd. have been speaking with advisers to help explore ways to stabilize Ubisoft and bolster its value, the people said, asked not to be identified discussing a private matter. One of the possibilities being discussed would involve teaming up to take the company private, according to the people.

Shares of Ubisoft have fallen 54% in Paris trading this year, giving the company a market capitalization of about €1.4 billion ($1.5 billion). Tencent owned 9.2% of Ubisoft’s net voting rights at the end of April, while the Guillemot family held about 20.5%, according to the firm’s latest annual report.

Some minority shareholders including AJ Investments have been pushing for either a take-private or a sale of Ubisoft to a strategic investor amid the stock price plunge. Considerations are at an early stage and there’s no certainty they will lead to a transaction. Tencent and the Guillemot family are also considering other alternatives, according to the people.

Spokespeople for Ubisoft and the Guillemot family declined to comment. A representative for Tencent couldn’t immediately comment during a holiday week in China.

Last month, Ubisoft shares fell to their lowest in more than a decade after the company cut its outlook on weaker-than expected sales and a delay on the hotly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows title. The video game firm has over the past couple of years struggled to recover from a pandemic-era production crunch that resulted in delays in the release of new games and canceled titles.

Several private equity firms including Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. were studying potential bids for Ubisoft in 2022 amid a flurry of large deals in the video game industry, Bloomberg News reported at the time. Later that year, the founding family partnered with Tencent, which bought 49.9% of the Guillemot Brothers holding company in addition to the direct stake it held in Ubisoft.

The deal was seen by analysts as a way of keeping suitors at bay, allowing the brothers to remain in control of the Ubisoft’s governance with Tencent’s stake capped below 10% with no operational veto rights. Under the deal, Tencent also couldn’t sell its shares in Ubisoft for five years, after which the Guillemot family has the right of first refusal. The pact still allows the brothers to talk and work with whoever they want, Ubisoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yves Guillemot said in an interview last year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1fw0evu/tencent_guillemot_family_are_said_to_consider/
308,1fvhnv3,HumActuallyGuy,1727987956.0,Ubisoft will probably use Splinter Cell to try to save itself ,91,151,"Everyone is mad/confused about the rumors of a Splinter Cell Blacklist Remaster when we are expecting a remake of the original SC but it makes sense given current Ubisoft status. 

I think we can all agree Ubisoft is in a bad spot. Skull and Bones and SW:Outlaws are not the big hits the investment in them would justify so now they are scrambling expecially given AC:Shadows is controversial and that might not translate in sales.

#They need a win AND FAST

So given any other project they have might be a long ways off they need something that can be done in less than a year maybe months. Given Blacklist is still a late 360/PS3 game it stands to reason they could much easily code a remaster than any of their games.

So a Blacklist Remaster makes sense if you need quick good publicity, you revive a dead franchise, make fans happy, hell, if they really want to go for gold they might rework lighting to make Blacklist more like old SC.

In summary, it's a easy win that doesn't require a lot of investment or a lot of time to make and given Ubisoft might be strapped for cash and time. It makes sense.

But yeah ... this is my take, made this post because half the posts on this sub lately have a ""it doesn't make sense"" ""why"" comments and the reasons I listed above are always brought up.

Edit: Because a lot of people are commenting this, no, I don't think this is a good decision but Ubisoft is desperate and also *with the information we have* Blacklist remaster is no replacing the original remake and also guys, learn the difference between remake and remaster pls.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Splintercell/comments/1fvhnv3/ubisoft_will_probably_use_splinter_cell_to_try_to/

Ubisoft as a company is flushing themselves down the toilet right now, and I wouldn't expect to see anything Splinter Cell for years and years, if at all. 

The key points here are that Ubi is holding back their talent by basically putting restrictions on what their devs can create, in order to not offend anyone. Then there's the fact that they are prioritizing management roles over developer roles, and on top of that, the people in management don't know sh*t about what the gamers actually want, and don't care, and it has been clear in the past that they don't care about player feedback. Then you have the obvious, sh*tty workplace culture at Ubi. 

In terms of a new SC game? Even if there was one, you can bet it would be bad. And any remakes are just going to be at the bottom of the list until Ubisoft starts selling acceptable units of video games. Hell they couldn't even get the Japanese AC game that everyone's been wanting for years right, and all they keep doing is trying to defend themselves about the way they have been bastardizing Japanese culture in AC Shadows. They only used the feud Japan era for profit. SW Outlaws turned out to be a mid game because of all the reasons listed above and more, especially the part where they can't offend anyone, so they play it safe. An open world SW game with a criminal underworld could have been a 10/10, but instead it was a 6/10. ",https://youtu.be/TUu7-i1kMyg?si=bMVOyODUl6dXEjwn

314,1fsd9ij,Raidenski,1727639990.0,The (Chiappa) Rhino was specifically designed to reduce recoil...so why does it still have such horribly low stability in this game? ,228,41,"The Rhino, developed and produced by Chiappa Firearms, was designed with a 6 o'clock, low-bore axis, where the barrel is located on the bottom of the frame as opposed to the more traditional 12 o'clock top-bore axis located at the top of the frame. 

This design, which was patented by Emilio Ghisoni, who also designed the Mateba Model 6 Única (aka Mateba Autorevolver), was made specifically to reduce recoil often experienced in traditional revolvers; firing a bullet from the Chiappa Rhino, the kickback would push the firearm backwards, as opposed to upwards. 

Realistically speaking, the Rhino was designed specifically to have less recoil than your average revolver/pistol, and should havet he highest stability out of all the sidearms available in the game, so why is it that firing this gun in the game has such really bad recoil? 

As a relatively new player, when I first saw this weapon in the Weapons Vendor, I was excited to unlock it at a later point, and when I finally found a copy and fired away, I was beyond disappointed at just how horrible the recoil is; at the very least it should have the same level of recoil as the M1911, if not miles better. 

Did Ubisoft just add it into the game without doing any research on it whatsoever just because it looks cool? 

I know this is just a videogame, but as someone who's been interested in firearms for most of their life, I would have expected a multi-billion dollar videogame developer to have done at least some research into a weapon's designs and how the effect of changing traditional designs would impact the functionality of a weapon, especially as something as fundamentally different as a 6 o'clock barrel.

In the last few years, you have noticed a drop in the gameplay quality of their games. I have a tolerance for long games if they are well-made. I truly enjoyed AC: odyssey and considered it as one of my favorite Ubisoft games (AC: odyssey should have been the start of another separate franchise that focuses more on mythology-based RPG and not an assassin game), i liked Ghost Recon Wildlands and Breakpoint (after the patches). I enjoyed Far Cry 6 and the division series.

Ubisoft art direction and environmental artists are truly some of the best in the industry and capable of releasing amazing-looking games that run well year after year. The cities they create feel very authentic.

Ubisoft also has good gameplay systems, from how the weapons feel and perform, to how the combat flows, to the additional tools they give you to take several scenarios. to usually decent progression system that let you feel more powerful at times goes on

The stories they tell aren't bad, but aren't great either, almost every Ubisoft game follows the same formula, a starting locked-off area that teaches you game mechanics, then three (or more) independent separate areas with separate stories and characters that you can take in any order, and then a final confrontation.

If I have to summarize what makes games turn away from Ubisoft games are constant small frustrations that eventually add up to makes the game feels like a chore to play. Let’s give you some examples.

you can take a look at Far Cry 6 with repeated quest design, and removal of leveling up perks instead of sticking them to clothing pieces each scattered on a different part of the map behind puzzles or enemy camps. Or the not-present main villain, or the fact best gear is hidden behind a paywall.

Almost every Ubisoft game's best weapons and abilities are hidden behind a paywall. Their games are built around frustrating/edging you enough to shell out extra in-game monetization for a game that you already paid for. I am here wondering how much extra money are they making in these MTX console/PC games ? 

Every Ubisoft game must have a merchant that doesn’t take the regular currency, but only takes a premium currency that either has to grind for an unreasonably long time with random weekly reward.

Or selling a complete edition or ultimate edition of the game that doesn’t contain all the content, and you expected to fork extra money on that.

Not to mention the online requirements for single-player games, live services for most Ubi games and finally removing content from your library that you paid for.

All these frustrations add up to gamers automatically feeling like they are about to get screwed because Ubisoft has done so repeatedly in the past.

Some Ubisoft games feel off is that in most cases gameplay systems don't work well together.

In LoZ:Botw almost every upgrade is behind a temple puzzle, but these puzzles are diverse enough with a separate theme that allows challenge your problem-solving skills, different combat skills, timing skills, or creativity and the game gives you all the tools to do that early on.  AC: Valhalla obviously tries to copy the idea of a puzzle behind weapon and upgrade but you end up with a badly designed puzzle that is either not properly introduced, or just looking around to find an opening from an angle to shoot a lock so you can enter a door to shoot another lock to get to a lame rewards (ingots). And the best/coolest rewards (weapons/armors) are hidden behind a paywall. What makes matters worse is that you will spend more time than you like just to find the angle from where you want to shoot because of the game's dense geometry and the art style. Or the never-ending skill tree that is filled with +1% damage while (random action)…. It just feels disrespectful of your time. Even Immortal: fenyx rising suffers from a similar puzzle design but to a slightly lesser degree. These games just feel constantly frustrating you so go and buy ingots from the store using real world money

Or stealth section in star wars outlaws where you don’t have any stealth tools and broken line of sight system.

Or shallow characters and repetitive missions in every Ubisoft game that the writers of the game think they are amazing and cool.

And this makes me sad. Most Ubisoft games aren’t bad, they are a company that targets a 7/10 or 8/10 game that hasn’t released anything a real GOTY in the last decade. It feels like maybe if they spend more time polishing the gameplay systems, better writing,  and better quest design they can end up with solid games every time because you can see the potential. Ubisoft feels like the smart kid in highschool class, who is set to do the bare minimum to get a passing grading that you know can ace the exam if they make the effort, but after a long time doing these, you started wondering if that can even recover because of their bad habits. That is why their games always go on sale soon after launch because no one wants to pay the full price for a game they have played before with a different skin on top, especially when you know another one in releasing in few month that will end up a similar experience. The best way to enjoy a Ubisoft game is to take a long break between their franchise and that what I think instinctively we are doing as gamers.

 Yes, the game was downgraded.

 But did those graphics really exist in the first place? If it is just editing, CGI? Or if these graphics were made for a short, highly scripted demo that was much smaller than a large open-world game?

 And if they really existed, why to date no Ubisoft game has reached this graphic level? Since the explanation that the developers gave at the time was that they ""didn't really know the PS4 and Xbox One"". But now they know, right?

 And if the game had been released with those graphics, would it have been better? Since it's not just graphics that a game lives on. The content would still remain the same.

Why all these promises? Why all this effort, money and time spent just to sell a lie?

 And most importantly: What did Ubisoft expect to happen? When the game was released everyone would see that it was all a lie. And even though they made a lot of money from pre-sales, the company's reputation would be tarnished forever. And that's what happened.

 These doubts remain in my head for years. Could it be that today, after 10 years, no convincing explanation exists?

(Disclaimer: This is NOT a complaint about the game. This is my favorite game of all time. I just want to better understand how the whole downgrade situation happened and what was going on inside Ubisoft at the time.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/1fnqyfj/all_the_controversy_surrounding_the_launch_of/
319,1flrkl8,Euro_Twunk,1726881048.0,Why is AC viewed unfavourably among certain segments of the wider gaming population?,19,96,"I’ve only really started paying attention to gaming discourse over the last year or two, but I get the impression that a large amount of the wider gaming population, outside of the traditional AC player base, looks down on the franchise.

Now whether or not this is warranted when you consider all 13 titles—and putting aside any separate debates about Ubisoft as a company, or the recent Shadows controversies—I’d like to get a better idea of where and when this perception truly originated. Because while the series has certainly had its low points, I also think it’s produced some really good and unique titles over the years.

I don’t think Valhalla was a very good game (no offence to anyone who likes it), and I hear a lot of criticism levied towards it in particular. But did this really just start with the last major game, or does it run deeper? (Not counting Mirage, which was produced by a side studio and sold at a discounted price, since they were very upfront that it would be a smaller game using older tech.)

After the success of Black Flag, obviously Unity’s completely broken state on release marked a low point for Ubi which drew a lot of attention, and which Syndicate didn’t do much to quell. But then Origins was a genuinely brilliant game, and while I was taking a break from gaming at the time of its release, I understand now that it was actually really warmly-received (and continues to be looked upon favourably).

Afterwards we had Odyssey, and while I don’t think it’s a very good AC game for breaking a lot of the conventions that were deeply ingrained into the series’ identity, I do believe it is a genuinely great ARPG that refined some of the changes Origins implemented, and is a blast if you approach it as such—hell, it was even nominated for GOTY alongside games like RDR2 and God of War (and I’m not saying Odyssey reaches quite those heights, but still). It also sold really well, introducing the franchise to a new demographic, and paving the way for the monumental sales that Valhalla would eventually have as its immediate successor.

As for Mirage, while I personally love it and was prepared to encounter the game’s limitations that were outlined well before release, if you’re not in the AC bubble you may not have gotten that memo and just said “oh look a new AC game, let’s try it”. In which case I understand why it may not have improved your view of the series so much: it was a game made for a very specific niche of the player base that was never going to appeal to everyone, and while I think it held potential and made players like me much more hopeful for the future of the series, I could see why someone going in blind may have expected more from a AAA developer in the modern gaming landscape.

So ultimately, where does that perception originate in 2024? Do we think it comes largely from Valhalla and/or Mirage—with the former now being the last major entry in 4 years? Did it just never fully fade after Unitygate? Could it be due to the relative inconsistencies in quality between games? Could it be a spillover of the divisions in the player base itself? Or is it something else entirely—I’m just spitballing here?

I ask because with AC recently in the spotlight again, I’ve seen a lot of these views resurface among certain sections of gamers. And as someone who genuinely loves this series and wants to see it improve and continue to grow (emphasis on improve), I’d like to get a better understanding of why that perception seems to be so widespread--and why, in my opinion, some of the higher points of the series may be overlooked today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1flrkl8/why_is_ac_viewed_unfavourably_among_certain/
320,1fliaqb,Rain-D,1726855167.0,[Bug] Conquest mode co-op - Optic Camo is missing after Host's game crashed and restarted,2,2,"Good day to All,

I've already asked Ubisoft support regarding the issue, but they stated ""too many requests - expect delays with answers"". I will post here their solution for the issue (if any) as soon as they respond.

Steps for reproduction (my case):  
  
1) Playing game on laptop with lid down and regular screen attached.  
2) Start game as a host. Game in Conquest mode.  
3) My Wife joins me.  
4) During first play of Optical Camo mission - I've opened a cache with Optical Camo and got UI addition with default U button near Pistol.  
5) Got an issue with BT keyboard - keyboard didn't work - only mouse working.  
6) Opened laptop lid - game tried to minimize itself and crashed.  
7) My Wife remained in session - and on my advice left in correct way.  
8) Restarted laptop + windows + started Ghost Recon Breakpoint again.  
9) Invited my Wife again. Mission status reverted (as if we didn't open a cache).  
10) Followed mission and opened a cache again.  
11) My Wife has Optical Camo and it is working.  
12) I don't have Optical Camo - No button, no Optical Camo section in UI, no ""U"" button working.  
13) Restart of the game, switch roles host-guest didn't help.  


TL:DR Optical Camo is lost after game is restarted due crash mid-mission after Optical Camo was picked up.

It seems that there is conflict with character's global flag ""camo picked-up"" and whole mid-mission restart.

If you have experienced and fixed this bug - I would like to know. 

Till this moment I've seen suggestions to restart Conquest mode (will do after response of tech support). And delete and create new character (won't do - as I'm not replay-type of gamer).

Worked flawlessly. I am so excited to dance to songs I have missed and will make another post regarding it.


1) Songs no longer available:
Imaging practicing a song everyday and one day it's no longer there.

There are many reason but the main one being removal of good songs. I don't care about most of the songs there but the good songs, they just keep removing. I missed those songs so much that I just danced to a youtube video of that song, and I loved it. Since people don't actually dance with you live and the things Ubisoft has done with this game, I feel no reason to continue anymore.

I am going to download these videos to my own system and keep with me and just dance to them instead from now on. Also the current songs I am going to screen record if they are not available online. The last thing I want is the songs I am mastering removed without any 

Songs I missed:
Airplanes, Gangnam Style, Senorita, Gentleman, Teenage Dream, Happy and many many more.

2) Bugs that break:
a) Any sort of alarm or call triggers a double audio on the system the song is being played.
b) There is no screen lock feature and songs like Happy & Blue require you to clap and it can many times just close on it's own. The new confirmation feature is better but still it has issues. It simply needs a slider to work.
c) Can't remove songs from favorite. Every morning I remove the songs Teacher(Alternate) and many other and the next day it comes back again.
d) Your score depends on close to the router you are. There is no lag-delay check in the app. It's a simple thing, just ask the person to do a few motions at the start of the sesssion and the delay can be calculated. I started using the laptop's hotspot(closer) and my scores immediately improved.
e) 

3) Lies:
a) The online dance together feature is just wrong. It's just pre-recorded sesssions of other people. Earlier I thought these are people who are live then kept wondering why aren't they leaving if the song hasn't started yet.
b) Many songs which you expect would be something good turn out to be a cheap copy. What song comes to your head when you hear Criminal, Fancy or Down? Now go check in the app what these songs are and you will get my point.

4) Songs never added:
While looking on the internet for songs I missed I realized there are many songs that were never added to this live subscription model and I am pissed knowing these songs were held.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JustDance/comments/1fl7cm8/after_using_just_dance_now_for_two_years_now_i/

324,1fk0drr,excaliburps,1726685259.0,PSN Store “PlayStation Plus Exclusive Discounts” Sale Starts Today; Helldivers 2 the “Deal of the Week”,540,172,"Complete list of games: https://mp1st.com/news/psn-store-playstation-plus-exclusive-discounts-sale-starts-today-helldivers-2-the-deal-of-the-week

As the sale title implies, you need to be an active PS Plus member to get the discounts. Biggest news here is Helldivers 2 is on sale for 20 off (you don't need to be a PS Plus member to get it).

Loads of Ubisoft games discounted. Not a lot of games on sale, which is understandable since I am assuming Sony is gearing up for a big 30th anniversary sale soon.

Recommendations:

* Helldivers 2 - Deal of the Week (-20%, $31.99) - The first time this game is on sale. Definitely worth it especially if you have non-douchey friends who will help you co-op the enemies and not leave you alone to fend on your own.

* F1 24 Champion Edition (-40%, $53.99) - Can't say the bonuses are worth it. If you dig F1, then this is a no-brainer.

* Sea of Thieves Deluxe Edition (-40%, $29.99) - Over 1 million players can't be wrong, right? Pirate game without needing a peg leg. If you seek an alternative to Skull and Bones. Still heavily supported.

* AC Valhalla + Immortals Fenyx Rising Bundle (-75%, $22.49) - Not a bad deal given Valhall isn't a bad game by any means but just a tad too long for its own good.

* AC Valhalla + Watch Dogs Legion Bundle (-70%, $21.99) - Same as the one above, not a bad deal. But might drive too much open-world Ubi into your brains where you'll see markers everywhere.

* Watch Dogs 1 + 2 Golds Editions (-85%, $13.49) - Not a bad deal, though can't say if gameplay holds up to this day.

* Hell Let Loose Ultimate Edition (-50%, $34.99) - Includes a bunch of DLCs though not sure if worth it for the extra items. Era FPS that's still supported on consoles and PC.

* Dredge Digital Deluxe (-40%, $16.19) - People who dig Lovecraftian monsters, this is for you. Deceptively grim game.

* Far Cry Anthology Bundle (-75%, $37.49) - This bundle include Far Cry 3, 4, 5, 6. Dip your toes into the Far Cry pool in one go!

* Metro 2033 Redux (-85%, $2.99) - First Metro game from 4A, and this one adds graphical enhancements to the original game.

* Metro Last Light Redux (-85%, $2.99)  - Adds all the DLC and graphical improvements

* Skull Island: Rise of Kong (-65%, $13.99) - Not worth the buy, but in case you want to torture someone on how a giant ape game can be boring.

* Blasphemous + Blasphemous 2 Bundle (-40%, $26.99) - Metroidvania game(s). Heard good things about this but I haven't played it.

* Ultros Deluxe Edition (-40%, $20.99) - Another Metroidvania that garnered favorable reviews when it was released this year.

* Kingdom Come Deliverance (-90%, $3.99) - Action RPG. Expect action, intrigue and bugs. Might be time to bite in time for the sequel.

* Rainbow Six Siege Operation Edition (-65%, $27.99) - Includes about 50 operators from the previous years ready for you to make some noise and mess things up for your team. Still very much supported with quarterly seasons.

* Insurgency Sandstorm Gold Edition (-50%, $34.99) - Comes with Year 1 Pass. Multiplayer tactical FPS. This is not Call of Duty. Not sure on support, but this had a ton of updates previously. Still a tad too pricey for it, but in case you want a military FPS that's not COD. This does not have a campaign but more on PvP or squad up with friends in co-op objectives.

* Castle Crashers Remastered (-80%, $2.99) - Played this at launch and an awesome co-op game. Cartoony graphics but harder than it looks.

* Cities: Skylines (-85%, $14.99) - City building game. Price includes a load of DLC. Might be worth the pickup since the sequel's console release just went MIA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fk0drr/psn_store_playstation_plus_exclusive_discounts/

AJ Investments, a hedge fund based in Slovakia that holds less than 1% in Ubisoft, said in a letter to management that it was unsatisfied with the current performance and strategic direction of the company.

Ubisoft has been facing a number of setbacks in recent months. It no longer expects to release “Rainbow Six Mobile” and “The Division Resurgence” in the fiscal year ending in March 2025, saying in July that developers needed extra time to ensure the games meet players’ expectations.

The delays came after the group ceased development of “The Division Heartland,” a decision it made to redeploy resources to bigger releases such as “XDefiant.” Its share price has tumbled more than 50% over the last 12 months. Shares in Paris were down more than 9% on Monday after AJ Investments published its letter to Ubisoft management.

Juraj Krupa, founder and chief executive of AJ Investments, said he wanted the letter to be a wake-up call for other investors. The hedge fund said Ubisoft should go private and urged the founding Guillemot family not to block a sale process. It also called for the installment of a new chief executive willing to weigh the sale of some studios and lay off staff to cut costs.

Ubisoft didn’t respond to a request for comment on the letter.

You’ve had a shitty mousetrap solution for years that is easily bypassed. On top of that, if someone gets detected, they just hop into a quick match a few games and they’re back to cheating

For context, Valorant HARDWARE bans people immediately after detection, cancels the match, and refunds MMR (also don’t even get me started how much worse R6 match making is)

You have nothing to blame but yourselves for the player base dropping once again because of cheaters ruining the game for the rest of us.

Why is your entire strategy to cater to and coddle these losers? (No perma bans, weak detection, moving to PC queue for a couple games even though your detection still sucks) Because they spend money on the game? 

So short sighted. What about the majority of your player base that doesn’t cheat that will leave the game because it isn’t fun or fair to play against these losers?

Yet another bullet point in Ubisoft incompetence



EDIT: in response to the feedback about “Well almost all the top players and top spenders are cheating”, I’ll do your job Ubisoft and propose a solution:

Blast this message everywhere: social media, when you load up the game, and especially when someone gets detected: “30 day last chance period. Anyone detected using XIM after this period will face immediate ban”. Gives the cheaters time to switch to controller, and time for them to realize you will take enforcement seriously.

Half baked idea but better than whatever non-sense you guys have proposed about how putting them in PC lobbies will somehow change the cheating situation. [Hint, most aren’t using MnK on console because they don’t have a PC. They do it because they like the feeling of power they get over controller players.

I do my best to explain the issue, but the ""Rep"" who responded had their name change EVERY response, and it boiled down to me asking to having ownership of the game transferred to the new email. 

The answer? NO! You can't transfer ownership to an email that has an active Ubisoft Account. So, you need an account to contact customer support, but you can't have an account if you want to transfer ownership from a NONEXISTENT email that has YEARS of your game on it to your actual email.

Alright, screw it. I guess I'll start from scratch with Steam, right? Also no! Because it requires the log in to the ubisoft account, and attempting to link Steam (which I paid for the game a second time) to a Ubisoft that doesn't own the game itself, pops up an ""Issue Authenticating Ownership"" and wants you to contact Customer support...

332,1ge0oso,Barlousd6,1730118253.0,... Help ? Game freeze I can't play,3,13,"Hello everyone ! 

(English is not my first language so there will be some mistakes sry)



I recently bought a new PC, including a new graphics card, and when I tried to play Assassin's Creed Origins, the game didn't launch. Although this problem has been solved, it doesn't make sense (having an RTX Nvidia 4070 Super, I had to lower the graphics settings to ""medium"", but whatever, I'll say it in case it's useful to identify the problem.)

After a few hours, I was able to play the game for about thirty minutes (until the entrance of the first town), and then the game froze with the music still playing in the background. No more interaction is possible with the game, so a total freeze. I stopped the game via task control, and restarted it. It happened 2 or 3 times before I could continue to play, and each time it happened to me with a few meters of difference.



Then, the tutorial for assassination arrives, and when displaying the tutorial menu, the game freezes again. I restarted the game, it didn't freeze at the same time, but still froze and I respawned at the assassination of the first soldier (after a few tries).



I have restarted a good dozen times since that (bug occurred on 10/27/2024 for info), I reinstalled the launcher, reinstalled the game on another disk (not external this time), checked the files, checked that there were no residues from another game, I tried on a new game file to check that it was not corrupted or something like that, I lowered the graphics settings to the maximum (no overheating by the way) and I tried with the controller and not keyboard + mouse. Nothing changed.



I've been looking around the forums, I've read about an Nvidia version that would reveal a bug in the game, but from what I understand, Nvidia and Ubisoft are rejecting the responsibility on one another, and I don't even know if that corresponds to my problem.

  
PS : I've also sent a ticket to Ubisoft, but wanted to ask directly to the community that knows the game well.



Anyway, do you have a solution maybe ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AssassinsCreedOrigins/comments/1ge0oso/help_game_freeze_i_cant_play/
333,1g9mu9i,RyuuzakiRyoto,1729615728.0,Ubisoft unfortunately disbanded team responsible for one of the best games made this year: Prince of Persia The Lost Crown because it didn't meet sales expectations with refusal of a sequel.,4553,528,,https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-has-disbanded-the-team-behind-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-game-did-not-reach-expectations-and-sequel-was-refused.1016355/
334,1gc28be,SoSneeKee,1729883697.0,Ubisoft Support Experience,9,8,"Hello, everyone.  2 years ago, I signed up for a Referral Program for Rainbow Six Siege. If the program were completed, you would be granted an in-game skin.  I completed the program according to all parameters, but never received any reward. The program showed completed on my user.  However, the progression was stuck for multiple of my participants I recruited. No matter how many games we played, the progress bar would not increase. After filing a support case, which was subsequently escalated to an internal team, it was confirmed that the progress tracking was bugged and thus failed to deliver the reward that I earned.  At the time, ubisoft support said there is nothing they could do, as there was no way for them to generate a skin for my account.  I dropped it because I believed that this made sense at the time. Fast forward 2 years to now.  With the inception of Rainbow6 marketplace, players can obtain skins from past events, challenges, etc, so long as they have enough r6 currency to pay for it.  Thus, I opened a new support case in hopes Ubisoft Support could either provide me with the r6 credits necessary to buy the skin, or buy the skin themselves and help transfer it to my account.  Below is a record of my experience with this issue.

After referencing previous cases and once again providing screenshots that the progression tracking was bugged, an Ubi rep escalated my case again.  The result they found was that the tracking was indeed bugged at the time, which is why I never got the skin.  Thus, I explained that this skin is now available on marketplace and requested the allotted amount of credits so I may purchase it at no expense to myself.  For reference, this skin is now worth $700USD+/88k  r6 credits+ due to its rarity.  This is why I cannot just buy it myself. Ubisoft support once again told me there is nothing they could do, which I find hard to believe.  How is a support team that assists with r6 credit issues unable to issue r6 credits? They then said ""sorry about that!"" and closed my case.  Naturally, I reopened the case and asked to speak with someone who COULD help me.  Well, support continued to stonewall me, citing that the rewards program was over by the time I opened a case.  This is true, but their own website says that rewards may take 24hr+ to appear on the account, so how could I have known there was a bug before that 24hr time period?  I pushed this issue with support and continued to reopen the case, but they have now resorted to copying/pasting canned responses and bullying me with the threat of support strikes due to ""inappropriate behavior on this case."" As far as I can tell, the only inappropriate thing I've done here is ask Ubisoft Support to do their jobs. I have meticulously provided every shred of detail and evidence they requested regarding this issue.  I had to bother real-life friends to reinstall this game to help me with this referral program two years ago, then bother them again for screenshots proving it is bugged.  Ubisoft does not seem to care and refuses to provide me with a fake, in-game currency to resolve this issue.  It is a very simple solution in my eyes, but they claim there is nothing anyone at the company can do.

I have played this game since day 1 early access, with 9 years of purchase history illustrating my support of this game. My intention is not to generate malice towards Ubi Support, it is to give you some insight on what the ubisoft support experience is like: ""Yes we see proof of the issue, yes the issue was our fault, no we will not do anything about it whatsoever. Sorry you are out $700+, just let it slide this time, okay?"" I have included my entire correspondence with support regarding this matter so you may independently decide who is at fault here.  Please do not harass ubi representatives below.  I have censored the individual rep names to prevent this. It is extremely frustrating that they cannot facilitate such a simple request. I just want the damn skin that I earned.

This is absolutely insane , how desensitized people are to death threats , It's incredibly vile and disgusting , especially over mundane topics like video game discussion. 

It's obviously a empty threat , but it's distressing nonetheless , WHAT THE HELL is going on with this sub?  Anti-Woke sentiments in comments , constant ubisoft slandering and unrelated discourse , it's just sad. 

Pathetic 

Edit: ""no need to make a post about it"" oh sorry , I didn't get the memo that it was just the causal Saturday where we throw death threats at each other. Sorry for taking up 1kb of space with my post on the internet and bothering you about this tiny issue. 


Edit 2: I woke up fully expecting to see more messages telling me I’m being ""soft"" and dismissing the situation as just the internet being the internet. To my surprise, I received so many heartwarming responses from people who truly understood how serious this is. Death threats, even if fake, are inhumane and insensitive. The more we ignore and normalize them, the more they’ll continue to happen.

I want to thank everyone for their kind responses—I didn’t expect such support, especially when you usually get bullied for being ""soft."" I’m very proud of this community 🙏 , thanks ya""ll

337,1g18x0t,ileanaki,1728650700.0,Ubisoft Support Ignoring Cheating Reports – Cheater Still Active in Rainbow Six Siege,2,19,"Hey fellow Siege players,

I’m reaching out to the community because I’ve been dealing with an ongoing issue, and Ubisoft Support hasn’t taken any real action to resolve it. I’ve reported a blatant cheater multiple times using the in-game report system, but they’re still active, ruining matches for everyone involved.

Here’s what’s going on:

* **Type of Cheating:** Wallhacking
* **Frequency:** I’ve encountered this player in multiple games, and the cheating is obvious. Despite reporting them through the in-game system, nothing seems to be happening.

I’ve contacted Ubisoft Support multiple times, but I keep getting generic responses telling me to “use the in-game report system” or that they “cannot communicate the outcome of the investigation.” While I understand they can’t share details, the fact that this player is still cheating in plain sight weeks later is incredibly frustrating.

I’ve even posted the player on [reputation.gg](http://reputation.gg) and he already got a reputation ban.

**Has anyone else had a similar experience with reporting cheaters and not seeing any action? How can we, as a community, get Ubisoft to take this seriously?**

I’m considering escalating this issue further and possibly making it more visible on other platforms, but I wanted to see if any of you have suggestions or success stories with getting cheating reports addressed.

Let’s keep Siege fun and fair!

Thanks for any advice or support.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1g18x0t/ubisoft_support_ignoring_cheating_reports_cheater/

339,1fxj7n7,ZS1664,1728228880.0,The original Far Cry still holds up pretty well today.,133,76,"You might know Far Cry as the franchise most responsible for making Ubisoft the way it is today.  Assassin's Creed laid the groundwork, but Far Cry 2's large open world built the solid foundation, and you can make a strong argument that Far Cry 3 was the game that firmly codified the Modern Ubi Formula.  But long ago there was a little German developer called Crytek with a big dream.  They wanted to make an engine for a PC game that could let you see as far as they eye could see, and be as lush and beautiful as it was fun to play.  And possibly melt your computer if it wasn't powerful enough.  That's where Far Cry began.  It was a big success - big enough for Ubi to snap up the IP for itself, and certainly successful enough for Crytek to make a spiritual successor, Crysis (which would most certainly melt your computer if it wasn't powerful enough.)

I've been meaning to give it another go, and [this still very in-development mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/far-cry-advanced-version) that adds a bunch of tweaks and modernizations gives me the perfect excuse.  So far it's been really good; that Far Cry mix of stealth and precision attacks still works great even in its infancy and gameplay has been fast and tight.  Yes, I remember what happens in the second half, but hopefully it'll be much more bearable with knowledge and foresight.  I'm impressed that people would actually take the time to polish this old game up and it's still fun as hell.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fxj7n7/the_original_far_cry_still_holds_up_pretty_well/

I hope this message finds you well.  
  
***Me:*** I am respectfully requesting a reconsideration of the decision to deny my request to unlink my Ubisoft account from Steam. As mentioned, I believe I was approved for a one-time exception to unlink the account, and I have already provided the necessary verification for this process. I understand there may be limitations, but I would greatly appreciate further clarification on what specific policies or technical issues are preventing this unlinking.  
  
Additionally, I would like to emphasize the technical difficulties I am experiencing when launching Rainbow Six Siege via Ubisoft Connect, which results in my computer freezing. This issue significantly impacts my gameplay experience, and playing through Steam has been the most stable solution for me. I've never been able to play through Steam on my main account. Therefore, I kindly request a second review of my case or guidance on how I might proceed, as the current situation is not only frustrating but also prevents me from fully enjoying the game.  
  
If there are any further steps I can take to assist in resolving this issue, or if escalating this case for further review is possible, I would appreciate your assistance.  
  
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you and hope for a reasonable resolution.

***Me:*** Subject: Request for Further Review and Escalation – Case #21814309  
  
Dear Ubisoft Support,  
  
Thank you for your prompt response. I understand that there are technical limitations and internal policies in place regarding my request to unlink my Ubisoft account from Steam.  
  
Given that I am experiencing critical technical issues when launching Rainbow Six Siege through Ubisoft Connect (resulting in frequent freezes), I kindly request that my case be escalated to a senior support agent or manager for further review. I have never been able to play the game through Steam on my main account, and resolving this would greatly enhance my experience.  
  
Additionally, if unlinking is not possible due to these limitations, are there any alternative solutions, such as transferring game data or achievements between my Ubisoft accounts, that could help resolve this issue?  
  
I appreciate your time and consideration, and I hope to find a solution that allows me to fully enjoy the game.  
  
Best regards

***Me:*** Dear Ubisoft Support,  
  
Thank you for your continued assistance with my case. I appreciate your efforts to address my concerns regarding the technical issues I am experiencing with Rainbow Six Siege.  
  
I understand the limitations regarding unlinking accounts and the five-strike policy in place. However, I would like to kindly request further assistance in exploring any possible alternatives that could help resolve my situation. I'd like to ask where the five-strike policy is located in the code of conduct. I didn't know there was such a rule in place. I apologize for the behaviour that caused me to receive a strike. I'm only trying to solve the issues present so I can play Rainbow Six Siege without having to worry about my PC crashing.  
  
Given that I have experienced critical freezing issues when launching the game through Ubisoft Connect, I have taken some steps as advised, such as updating my graphics drivers and verifying game files. Unfortunately, these measures have not resolved the problem, and I am still only able to launch the game using the Vulkan desktop icon.  
  
I would greatly appreciate any additional guidance or support you could provide, including:  
  
Suggestions for troubleshooting the freezing issue further.  
Possible solutions for linking my original Ubisoft account to Steam, or any alternative methods to ensure I can fully enjoy the game without interruptions.  
Thank you for your understanding and support. I look forward to your response.

Dear Ubisoft Support,  
  
I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to clarify my previous communication regarding my account. I reached out initially from my main account, ScytheFR, and I am currently trying to unlink my separate account, ScytheGA, from Steam.  
  
I intended to seek assistance without causing any confusion, and I am concerned that responding from ScytheGA might lead to misunderstandings or additional strikes under the five-strike policy. I am not fully aware of the behaviours that may result in strikes, and my goal is to resolve the technical issues I am experiencing with Rainbow Six Siege.  
  
Could you please clarify if responding from a different account may have any consequences? I would appreciate your guidance on how to proceed without jeopardizing my case further.

That's where the conversation has gotten so far. I'm so unbelievably frustrated with what's happening right now. I don't even know what I'm supposed to do now.

I got them to change my Email address! I answered to their standard response providing further evidence that it is my account. I sent pictures of my account opened with a verification of my name on a piece of paper. I sent them my ip-address (I know not the best idea) and a picture of my id with only the information relevant shown (I know even more risky, but I was desperate). 
Lust but not least, I threatened them to take legal actions if they don't approve my request. After a couple of minutes I got a response, that they approved the request to change my email! 


So my situation is as followed:

I lost access to my E-Mail address used for my Ubisoft account (its a longer story, however i still have access to old E-Mails from the time i still had access). I wrote the support, to change the E-Mail, i gave them multiple proofs that i own this account (multiple keys i used, transaction numbers from games i directly bought from ubisoft, etc.). However, today i got a standard e-mail that all of this does not count and they won't change the e-mail address. 

In the meantime i found an e-mail from the time i activated 2FA with the 6 one-time codes to login, so i manged to get access back (in a way). This might be the reason support denied my request since they saw the account being actively used. 

Now i have access to my account but with reduced security (because i needed to deactivate 2FA) but i still can't change my e-mail address on my own (the link is sent to the old e-mail address). So do you have any ideas what to do now? Write again to the support and hope that this time i don't get a standard rejection e-mail? Live old e-mail and hope that i never have to verify anything with the e-mail?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1fl5e3o/lost_access_to_my_email_address_what_to_do_next/

The game only launches when Ubisoft Connect is offline, which has been made needlessly difficult ever since the redesign. And on Geforce Now (which is one of my most used ways to play games atm) offline mode is impossible to activate, leaving me with almost no option to play the game without inconvenience.

I've been trying to tell Support for a few days now in an ongoing case, but they just keep suggesting steps they've already suggested before, requesting files and data I've already given them or completely missing what the actual issue is. It's as if they can't even be bothered to read any previous messages.

I understand that the game is already over a decade old (God, I feel old), but it's still being sold, so imo they have a responsibility to keep the game working. But they keep insisting that the problem is with my system and completely ignore the fact that the issue persists on streaming services that are completely unrelated to my system. It's infuriating.

354,1fliaqb,Rain-D,1726855167.0,[Bug] Conquest mode co-op - Optic Camo is missing after Host's game crashed and restarted,2,2,"Good day to All,

I've already asked Ubisoft support regarding the issue, but they stated ""too many requests - expect delays with answers"". I will post here their solution for the issue (if any) as soon as they respond.

Steps for reproduction (my case):  
  
1) Playing game on laptop with lid down and regular screen attached.  
2) Start game as a host. Game in Conquest mode.  
3) My Wife joins me.  
4) During first play of Optical Camo mission - I've opened a cache with Optical Camo and got UI addition with default U button near Pistol.  
5) Got an issue with BT keyboard - keyboard didn't work - only mouse working.  
6) Opened laptop lid - game tried to minimize itself and crashed.  
7) My Wife remained in session - and on my advice left in correct way.  
8) Restarted laptop + windows + started Ghost Recon Breakpoint again.  
9) Invited my Wife again. Mission status reverted (as if we didn't open a cache).  
10) Followed mission and opened a cache again.  
11) My Wife has Optical Camo and it is working.  
12) I don't have Optical Camo - No button, no Optical Camo section in UI, no ""U"" button working.  
13) Restart of the game, switch roles host-guest didn't help.  


TL:DR Optical Camo is lost after game is restarted due crash mid-mission after Optical Camo was picked up.

It seems that there is conflict with character's global flag ""camo picked-up"" and whole mid-mission restart.

If you have experienced and fixed this bug - I would like to know. 

Till this moment I've seen suggestions to restart Conquest mode (will do after response of tech support). And delete and create new character (won't do - as I'm not replay-type of gamer).

355,1fgzl4k,CryAltruistic6398,1726358353.0,Ubisoft support is BAD.,2,10,"Just wanna come on here to tell everyone about my bad experience of the ubisoft support. 

I opened a case on Apr 08, 2024 regarding prime loot that I had claimed but not recieved. Loot that go back all the way to Dec 18, 2021, the Rainbow Six Siege: Pericote Operator Bundle. This is not the first time I opened a case regarding this but last time back in 2022 they just closed the case and said that they couldn't verify my account and closed the game. Back then I wasn't playing a lot of R6 so I didn't care so much but now however I've put in countless hours into the game and want my loot! I did not hear from the ubisoft support at all untill 06 May 2024, almost a month later only for the message to be an automated response. I stayed cool and replied that I still need help. 

I real human answered me 24 hours later to ask me what platform I was on and to send screenshots of all my loot that I've claimed. Taking 25 screenshot of all the loot I've missed is not so fun when prime gaming doesn't let you sort your loot by game title. Sent over a list and screenshot of all the loot. A day later I am told to unlink and link my account (which I already mentioned I did in my first message). I've done this multiple times before contacting the support. I still listened to what the agent said and unlinked and re-linked my account. It did nothing.

After 4 days I get a respond asking if I have linked it properly and that they need new screenshots of me claiming the loot ""uncropped"". The screenshots I sent before were totally fine you saw everything, my mail, date it was claimed on etc. I still did what the agent said and re-took all my 25 screenshots. They then tried to blame the issue on me not having my account linked when claiming the loot which doesn't even work. You can't claim twitch prime loot without linking your account first. 

On 19 May 2024 they thank me for sending the new screenshot and proceed to ask me for logs on my PC, I send them over as well. This is when I relize that the issue most likely is in that I have an old account which I might have linked by accident when I first started playing R6. I mentioned this to the agent and provided him with the mail I used for my old account and he instantly tried closing the case blaming it on that he didn't find any logs of me logging into the old account in the logs I provided. Obviously he didn't since I havn't logged onto that account for years.

I asked the agent if there's any other way I can prove that I am the owner of the old account. He sends a mail to the mail of my old account with a code. I send the code in the case. After that the agent escelates the case to another team. The agent escelated the case on 26 May 2024, i got a response on 02 Jul 2024...

The new agent wants me to send info that I already sent in the case. Too tired to say that I already attached all that info since I know it will just take time since their response time is 1-30+ days I send the info.

The new team can confirm that the loot has been sent to my old account. This is when I got my hopes up. The new agent wants me to unlink everything, twitch to prime, amazon to twitch, ubisoft to twitch etc etc. I do exacly as the agent tells me to do. Everything is re-linked and I send screenshots of everything saying it's linked. Agent says he can't see that it is linked. 

After half a month of back and forth messages sounding like this:

*- It is not linked*

*- But I have linked it? See my screenshots.*

*- It is not linked try this (random KB article)*

*- Is it linked now?*

*- No*

Over and over and over again. Finally the support sends me one last link which finally work. The agent asks me to confirm that I want the loot sent to the new account. At this point I was so hyped and had my hopes up. I confirm and the agent tells me I have to do one last thing. Unlink my account from amazon... 

The agent sends me a link to a Luna website and wants me to unlink there. The site hasn't launched in Europe yet... I inform the agent that I cant login to the site since it is not available in EU. They then tell me to send them a screenshot of my amazon profile. I do. They say it is the wrong view profile. Then after some days they tell me to sign into Luna again. I once again had to explain that I can't sign into Luna due to it not being available in EU.

Then they escelate the case again... On 24 Jul 2024. I wait, and wait. And finally on 21 Aug 2024 I get a new reply. They help me link something new once again. After that they ONCE AGAIN on 25 Aug 2024 had to (in there own words) ""escalate it to our Specialized Team for further investigation"". 

On 11 Sep 2024 I get this response:

*""Unfortunately, we are not able to add or transfer twitch drops that were not redeemed at the time on this Ubisoft account.""*



I ask them what they mean by this since I obv as shown in the screenshots DID claim the loot on time. They answer instantly with:

*""We understand that this is not the outcome you were hoping for, but we are limited in our capacity to facilitate your request.""*

I ask them to read though the case to get an understanding about the case since from what it sounds like they don't know anything about the case. They reply with: 

*""Unfortunately, we are not able to add or transfer twitch drops that were not redeemed at the time on this Ubisoft account.""*

Almost the exact same response. I ask them again to please explain what they mean. I get the following response: 

*""Unfortunately, we are not able to add or transfer twitch drops that were not redeemed at the time on this Ubisoft account.""*



I reply to them saying that I am highly unsatisfied with their support. 156 days for them to say this? They reply with (to no ones suprise): 

*""Regrettably, we cannot add or transfer Twitch drops that were not redeemed on this Ubisoft account at the time.""*



At this point I thought for sure I was speaking with a robot so I said ""This is insane, what do you mean ""at the time"" this is an automated respnse let me speak to a human"" they respond with:

*""First of all, I assure you that you are not communication with a robot.*



*Unfortunately, after investigating your case, and as per our guideline, we cannot move forward with your request to transfer redeemed Twitch drops.*



*Please remember that we constantly try to provide our players with a safe a positive environment to enjoy their gaming experience.""*

I ask them what have I done wrong? They know where my loot got sent, they have confirmed that I am the owner of the account it got sent to, what is the issue? They respond with: 

*""As much as we would love to assist with this issue, we are not able to provide more information and move forward with your request to transfer redeemed Twitch drop""*

Im not gonna continue pasting what they said but this went on for a time, me asking for an explenation only for them to paste the same response. But the last message they sent they blamed it all on a ""business policy"". At this point I will admit I am very tilted at their support and dumb answers. I then sent the following respond which lead to me getting a ""strike"":

*""Can I see these ""business policies""??? If you had ""business policies"" regarding this why did it take you A HUNDERED AND FIFTY SIX DAYSSS TO SAY SO!?!??!?!?*



*I hope you understand how frustrating this is. I have stayd put and answered all your questions this entire time and been nice and friendly but this is REALLY pissing me off.""*

Sure, it is not a very nice message but I was very frustrated. As someone who myself works as IT support I always say that there is no excuse to be mean to the IT support, they are trying to help you. But this, 156 days I am beyond dissapointed.

357,1fgvfh5,Unable-Literature671,1726346359.0,"We're screwed anyway, let's talk about our WD4 delusions.",29,42,"Just like I said. ""Star Wars: Outlaws"" seemed to have a decent performance, but it fell short of the revival of Ubisoft.

This means that Ubisoft will move toward saving money by excluding future planned follow-ups.

In the meantime, I decided to write because I wanted to unravel my thoughts on WD4.

I thought about so many things, but it's a shame that I can't forget it like this.

First, let's talk about the starting point for the character.

The main character is either a college student who is good at hacking or just graduated from college. He has excellent hacking skills and inexperienced engineer skills.

And he have a very lively, close friend or family I've known for a long time, who resembles Wrench's personality.

Here, I'll call the above person ""N"" from now on.

N wasn't good at hacking and was always inexperienced, but he got along well with the main character because of his excellent engineer skills.

That's how the main character was supposed to meet N in the evening,

Just before meet, N across the street from the traffic light dies in an accident.

There are various causes such as bombing accidents, vehicle autonomous driving errors, and terrorism.

""But"" N's accident is a murder disguised as an accident. He doesn't know it yet.

The main character finds N's smartphone while organizing N's belongings.

And I hack to unlock my smartphone with N's lock on it.

After unlocking N's smartphone, the main character sees a picture of N's smartphone memories of each other, but N's smartphone messenger gets a notification.

""Yo. Why didn't you log in? I've been waiting for you so long :(""

So the protagonist meets with a team member from one of the few remaining Dedsec branches that survived the enormous ""Blume"" crackdown and online detection after Watchdogs 2.

also thought about this intermediate process, but I didn't write it down because I thought the story would be too long.

Now, shall we introduce the ""Refresh"" Dedsec character that has barely survived?

First, character K with a similar position to our Wrench and Jordi. 😎

K is a good match for N, and he's the one who helped N join Dedsec.

K's specialty is a character who can act like the main character.

So, he's a character who can investigate while working separately with the main character in the future.

K is a very easy person to get things related to guns and car computer parts. Isn't it amazing?

Now, let me introduce the character O.

O is a very cautious friend. O's specialties are 2D, 3D art, and hacking

I think O's appearance will remind me of Overwatch's mei.

Or the García of Criminal Minds comes to mind.

and She have long black hair. She like black Cloth very much, but not Goth.

But she wears a mask or mask every day and always uses a voice modulator when talking to strangers.

She hides himself from other Dedsec members besides the Dedsec members he met himself in person.

Oh, don't get me wrong. O doesn't have a scar. It's just that she hates lifting herself up.

She's a timid personality, but she does this for a reason. We'll learn from her assistant duties in the future.

However, O's hacking skills are excellent, so can't ignore them.

An essential figure in the online war using data research and AI Bot.

Let me introduce you to Y.

Y is similar to the role of a leader. It's a secret, but he always waiting in Dedsec.

Y is careful and cautious in speaking, but the moment the protagonist falls into a crisis, he makes a quick judgment and response to get him out of the crisis.

Lastly, it's a character named X.

X is kind of like a police officer and a soldier.

I'm in a bit of a hurry and I'm trying to act, but I think it's related to the crime syndicate or Blume that's coming up.

X later betrays Dedsec in the middle of the game, or misunderstands Dedsec. There must be a reason, right?

I want to talk more, but since it's a space for everyone, I just wrote down what came to mind.

364,1ehoozv,LunaFudge,1722538657.0,Reimagining the mainline Assassin's Creed games (some spoilers),13,9,"I’ve been thinking on how, over the years, the *Assassin’s Creed* mainline series has become slightly disorganized.

While the games are still individually entertaining, there is less cohesion across the franchise, and the recent RPG-style games have moved away from the traditional assassin-focused gameplay suggested in the series title.

Below are my recent thoughts on how I’d reimagine the franchise. This what I’d do if I had the ability to retrospectively make changes which would provide better cohesion for the whole series, and which I think provide more flexibility and scope with future installments.

**Disclaimer**: I haven’t played / read / watched all *Assassin’s Creed* content. There are most likely gaps in my knowledge that would impact the below.

**Disclaimer**: This is just for the mainline games, not the mobile games, books, comics, upcoming TV series, etc.

# New additions to the franchise

—

**Assassin’s Creed Outlaws**

Historical setting:

* England, 12th c.

Plot synopsis:

* The protagonist is the person on whom Robin Hood stories are based.
* It makes sense — hooded character, shrouded in legend, combat expert, served the common people, fought tyranny.
* This is an origin-story arc following a charitable bowman who is recruited into the Brotherhood. Instilled by a purpose of 'helping his people', he becomes a bowman in the army. But then he discovers the corruption and cruelty, pushing him toward the Brotherhood.
* Some retellings of Robin Hood depict him as having fought in the Crusades. This could overlap with the plot of *Assassin’s Creed* (2009), tying the story in with Altair’s story and showing how the Creed was brought (or re-introduced, considering *Valhalla*) to England through a single, linear mission set in the Holy Land.
* The protagonist's hideout is Sherwood Forest, serving as a base of operations where you can upgrade your equipment and plan missions.
* The protagonist must navigate the political intrigue and power struggles of the time, forging alliances and making enemies along the way.

Gameplay:

* The gameplay has all the expected mechanics of an *Assassin's Creed* mainline game — one-hit assassinations, stealth, social stealth, parkour. However, the game would have much deeper ranged combat mechanics, e.g. different ranged combat styles, a wider array of types of bow and ranged weapons, different types of arrows (a depth of ranged combat similar to the *Horizon* games).
* You build a band of 'Merry Men' during the story. You can, for example, use these characters in black box missions to help you distract guards or find access routes (e.g. Maid Marian causing a distraction; Little John brawling with guards; Friar Tuck giving you disguises or information to access fortifications).
* Leaning into the ‘Robin Hood’ reputation: You can pickpocket people, but only wealthy people. You have to identify them by their clothes, where they’re located, eavesdropping on their conversations, etc. You can gain favour by redistributing accumulated wealth to the common people. This can create more social stealth opportunities, get supplies or services for cheaper, open new infiltration or escape routes (e.g. guards who’ll give you access, being able to hide or escape through the back of taverns, etc.)

Map:

* This game would be set in a large map of England, centrally focused on Nottingham (*Valhalla*’s map would be slightly different, see below).

—

**Assassin’s Creed Origins**

2017’s *Origins* would be given a different name, see further below.

Historical Setting:

* Rome, 44BC and 96AD

This a different story about the origin of the Assassin Brotherhood (hence the renaming of 2017’s *Origins*).

* *Assassin’s Creed Origins* (2017) still exists in-universe, but is given a different name and the Hidden Ones do not originate in that story. There is >!no epilogue showing how Aya and Bayek founded the the Hidden Ones (see further below)!<.

The prologue follows the assassination of Julius Caesar.

* This is one of the most famous assassinations in history. It’s fitting that it would be the inception of the Assassin Brotherhood (as opposed to >!an epilogue event in 2017’s *Origins*!<).
* Caesar represented order, security, prosperity, but was a dictator. Those who assassinated him were motivated (in part) by maintaining democracy and the freedom the Republic.
* *Assassin’s Creed* is the story of ‘Assassins versus Templars’ as and allegory for ‘freedom and liberty’ versus ‘order and security’. It’s a philosophical war waged violently and secretly. It would be more suitable that these philosophical motivations were the origins of the Brotherhood. In 2017’s *Origins*, Bayek and Aya were principally seeking to >!avenge their son!<. By contrast, in this retelling, the prologue’s protagonist is principally acting to prevent ‘order and security’ through dictatorship, represented by Caesar, in the name of freedom.
* The most apt figure to play as in the prologue is Brutus. Aya / Bayek could make a cameo appearance, but the player gets a better sense of the motivations for the assassination of Caesar when playing as one of the assassins who murdered him in the name of democracy. Playing as Brutus also connects to Brutus’ appearance in the Ezio trilogy.

The main storyline takes place in 96AD.

* At this point, Rome was under the rule of a “despotic” emperor, Domitian. The plot culminates in the assassination of Domitian (a historical event), so that power could transfer to Nerva (regarded as a “good” Roman ruler who vowed to restore personal liberties).
* The playable protagonist is a descendant of Brutus (or whoever the playable prologue protagonist is). Messages and information have been left by the prologue for the main-game protagonist. The main-game protagonist tries to continue the legacy. Over the course of the game, they recruit allies and formalise their work into a ‘brotherhood’.
* Aware that the assassination of Caesar did not return Rome to a republic, the group establish ‘parameters’ for their work (a ‘creed’) in the hopes that these parameters will make sure their work is not unchecked. This causes tension with some members of the group during the course of the story, but it ultimately proven worthwhile.
* Because the game is set 96AD, the Colloseum is a playable location. To get close to Domitian to assassinate him, the protagonist disguises themselves as a gladiator and gains an audience with the Emperor after winning a series of fights, i.e. there are a several gladiatorial boss battles preceding the final assassination.
* Because the setting is Italy, there can be many easter eggs referencing the Ezio trilogy.

A DLC could follow how the Templars latched onto early Christianity as a vessel for spreading their power across Europe and the globe.

* The origin of the Templars’ influence in Christianity being revealed in letters in a non-main mission in *Valhalla* was underwhelming.

—

**Assassin's Creed Rogue**

This is a different version of the idea behind 2014's Rogue. So, I guess, Rogue (2014) wouldn’t exist in this reimagined universe (though I do love the game).

Historical setting:

* Europe, 1914 – 1918 (WW1 generally)

Plot synopsis:

* The same story beats happen like in Rogue (2014) — you begin as a novice Assassin, become disillusioned with the Brotherhood, turn to the Templar Order, and begin to hunt down other Assassins.
* The protagonist is a novice Assassin. They are part of a group that infiltrate the Black Hand. They collude to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand, aware that he is part of / influenced by the Templar Order and has pledged to commit some sort of crack-down or use some Isu device on their behalf once in power.
* The assassination goes awry, the Duchess is also killed, and the protagonist witnesses the fallout of this assassination leading to the death and destruction of WW1.
* The protagonist begins to believe the Assassins’ modus operandi is reckless and unchecked, despite the ‘creed’, and that the Brotherhood does not act with enough forethought to be able to prevent fallouts like WW1 resulting from their actions.
* The protagonist becomes disillusioned with the Brotherhood as a results, and begins to believe that the ‘order and security’ proposed by the Templars could have prevented WW1.
* The protagonist tracks down and kills Brotherhood leaders in Europe over the course of the game. This could culminate with a show-down in London against Lydia Frye (or a cameo from Evie Frye).

Why is this a better storyline than Rogue (2014)?

* This plot provides a more direct cause and effect between the philosophy and modus operandi of the Brotherhood and the fallout that pushes your character out of the Brotherhood and toward the Templars.
* Shay turned to the Templars after becoming disillusioned with the Brotherhood's handling of Precursor artifacts. He believed that disturbing these artifacts caused earthquakes, a view that put him at odds with the Brotherhood's leadership due to their recklessness and disregard for the consequences of disturbing Precursor artefacts. His disagreement was with the leaders' approach, not the core tenets of the Brotherhood itself — suggesting that a change in leadership could resolve the issue, rather than a full dissolution of the Brotherhood. However, in this new version of Rogue, the protagonist’s disagreement is with the act of assassinating key figures and the consequences therefrom, which is the Brotherhood’s core method and namesake. In this way, the protagonist has a stronger reason to seek the destruction of the whole Assassin Brotherhood.
* Rogue (2014)’s events may have given Shay motivation to leave the Brotherhood, but that doesn’t consequently mean he would have joined the Templars, too. His motivation for leaving the Brotherhood didn’t give him a strong reason to join the Templars (who were also seeking to disturb Precursor artefacts). In this reimagining of Rogue, the protagonist leaves the Brotherhood and is drawn to the Templars in the hope that the ‘order and security’ they’re preaching could prevent such cataclysmic wars.
* Precursor artefacts appear in many other games and don’t appear to cause such sizeable earthquakes when disturbed in those games, so there’s a slight continuity error in the series from Rogue (2014).
* This would be the closest a historical setting in a mainline game has been to the modern-day story (bar the WW2 missions in Unity). This game ends with the protagonist having killed a lot of the Brotherhood leadership. This helps explain why, in the modern-day storyline, the Brotherhood seems much smaller than it had been in other periods in history.

Map:

* The map is set across key locations in Europe during WW1.
* As the story progresses, there are time jumps, and as a result the status of the War changes. Parts of the map open up / become easier to explore as the nations win and lose battles.
* Your character is agnostic on the sides of the war effort, intent primarily on taking down the Assassins. Therefore, you can build alliances with different Powers or disguise yourself in order to open up new 'fronts' on the map.

Gameplay:

* Using disguises to access Map areas or buildings requires learning knowledge. You can wear a uniform to disguise yourself, but must also be prepared to answer questions based on information you might have learned elsewhere. For example, when you disguise yourself in uniform to infiltrate a military camp and you are spotted, you have an opportunity to answer a security question — but the correct answer to security question is gleaned from investigating information and clues in other parts of the map.
* Different fronts, battles, etc. provides an opportunity to bring back the conquest battle dynamic from Odyssey.

# An 'Assassin’s Creed Legends' series

—

This is a reimagined title series for mainline *Assassin’s Creed* games that do not fit into the traditional, assassin-focused, historically-accurate formula.

In other words, the RPG-type games would be ‘Assassin’s Creed Legends’ titles (*Origins* (2017), *Odyssey*, *Valhalla*) as well as any other *Assassin's Creed* game that experiments with the formula and realism (e.g. *Assassin’s Creed Hexe*, based on rumours). So, *Assassin’s Creed Valhalla* would be *Assassin’s Creed Legends: Valhalla*.

One of the key differences is that the modern-day story follows the activities of an Assassins’ Bureau historian. This character (which could be Layla) is piecing together the stories of allies of / inspirational figures for the Brotherhood through manuscripts, letters, tomes, diaries, etc. in an attempt to uncover clues about the Isu, the Templars, or whatever the through-line plot is.

Bayek, Kassandra/Alexios, and Eivor were not, foremost, Assassins in these games. Bayek was a Medjay, Kassandra/Alexios was a mercenary, Eivor was a Viking. >!None became ‘Assassins’ in the main game storyline!<. By reframing these games as retellings of the stories of people that were allies of / inspiration to the Brotherhood, and setting them under a different but related title, it gives Ubisoft a stronger licence to tell the story of non-Assassin protagonists in the *Assassin’s Creed* universe.

Most importantly, these stories are presented to the player as semi-factual legends within the game world rather than literal events.

Why would this set-up be more suitable for these games in the overarching *Assassin’s Creed* story?

Incorporating fantastical and mythological elements:

* The RPG games include much more fantastical elements, like undead pharaohs in *Origins* (2017), minotaurs and cyclops in *Odyssey,* and witches in *Valhalla.* The protagonists’ abilities are also more exaggerated to the point of being superhuman-like.
* This reimaging more elegantly explains the incorporation of fantastical, non-realistic elements. In this ‘Assassin’s Creed Legends’ reimagining, the source material is written accounts (manuscripts, diaries, etc.) rather than memories in the Animus, so the accounts of Bayek, Kassandra/Alexios and Eivor are coloured and exaggerated by the way the chronicler has recorded them.
* For chroniclers at these times, what we’d consider to be mythological were probably believed to be factual. So, from the perspective of the writer who recorded these protagonists’ stories, they were giving an accurate account.
* Rumours are that *Hexe* will be a “very different” type of *Assassin’s Creed* game, and that it >!will involve magical elements!<. I think this is another game that would be more suited to the ‘Assassin’s Creed Legends’ title for this reason.

Incorporating mythological DLC:

* *Origins* (2017), *Odyssey* and *Valhalla* had DLC based in mythological realms. However, in each game they function differently: in *Origins*, the Pieces of Eden ‘transport’ Bayek there; in *Odyssey*, the realms are ‘simulations’; in *Valhalla*, having taking hallucinogens, Eivor experiences ‘memories’ of these realms in which they look like Norse mythology. Instead, ‘Assassin’s Creed Legends’ would introduce DLC as newly-discovered manuscripts, chronicles, etc. retelling the protagonists’ adventures in mythical realms, conflating fact and fiction the way many ancient historians did. They could be presented as an epic semi-fictitious retelling (e.g. *The Iliad*). The modern-day protagonist is attempting to extract the fact from the fiction.
* This set-up can be used across the ‘Assassin's Creed Legends’ series, and even explains why DLC occurs later than the main storyline — because these stories were discovered or studied later.
* Some of the DLC are currently presented in these games as Animus memories, or memories within memories (e.g. *Valhalla*’s *Dawn of Ragnarok*). These are first-hand accounts. However, a second-hand account of these stories allows for a greater suspension of belief in the events that occurred.

Retelling the Isu story through the account of a chronicler:

* Because chroniclers at these times had mythology and religion as their frame of reference for most things, it also better explains why Isu stories from these games are presented to look like Norse, Greek or Egyptian mythology.
* For example, the Isu event of >!Loki betraying Odin!< retold in *Valhall*a would be presented in a classic Norse environment because that’s how the story was best explained to audiences and has been orally adapted over the years before it was transcribed into a manuscript (as opposed to just being conflated with Eivor's religious beliefs).

# Overall changes across the franchise

—

I think the overarching changes below would have improved the story and helped with overall cohesion in the series.

Remove the male/female protagonist choice.

* Choosing between Alexios or Kassandra, or male or female Eivor didn’t add to the story. And one of each of these had to end up being canon, anyway. So, they should have just gone with whichever makes the most sense for the plot and for the historical setting.

Remove most of the dialogue choices.

* The dialogue choices in the RPG games are mostly inconsequential. Instead, they undermine character development. For example, choosing the aggressive response in one dialogue choice and then the rationale response in the next detracts from developing the protagonist's own persona. Let the writers write compelling stories / characters.

The Templars have always been called the Templars.

* The name may have modified over the millennia (e.g. “Temple Order”, “Order of the Temple”), but the organization should be the same.
* Preceding organizations (Order of the Ancients, Cult of Cosmos) are generally unnecessary when they serve the same purposes as an antagonist of the Assassin Brotherhood. While the ‘Templar’ name is tied to the Crusades, I don't think there's a reason why it couldn't have existed in periods preceding the game. The name change felt unnecessary. >!That the “Templars” were founded after King Alfred destroyed the Order of the Ancients was revealed mostly in letters in a non-story mission was anticlimactic.!<

Similarly, the Assassin Brotherhood has always been called the Assassin Brotherhood

* The difference in name between ‘Hidden Ones’ and ‘Assassins’ was unnecessary when the operations and objectives were/are the same. Instead, from its origin, the Brotherhood should always have called itself the Assassin Brotherhood.

Remove the enumeration on the early games and give each game a subtitle.

* See changes to specific games in the series, below.

Reduce the amount of Isu content

* The ‘mystery box’ appeal of the Isu lore has waned with so many reveals over the course of the games.
* It feels like there are too many storylines that culminate in a fight over an Isu McGuffin in an underground Isu temple.
* The significance of Isu artefacts is lost when there are so many artefacts, Isu weapons and temples littered throughout the games.
* It’s harder and harder to suspend belief that the rest of society did not / does not know about the Isu when there are so many artefacts, machines and temples around the world.
* The end-of-the-world stakes in the early games was probably premature, it makes it harder to build stakes in the more recent games after that.
* I personally find the philosophical and literal war between Assassins and Templars more compelling than the Isu stuff.

# Changes to specific mainline titles

—

***Assassin’s Creed Valhalla***

Reimaging this game, there would be greater emphasis on Viking naval exploration.

* The base-game map would consist of Norway, England, Ireland, France, and another region (Denmark, Iceland, etc.). The ‘England’ region would be much smaller and more densely populated than in the 2020 game.
* Each of these regions in the base game would have more diverse regional enemy archetypes you encounter. This adds more variety for the long period spent exploring and navigating in this game.
* Splitting the base-game map between these several regions encourages the player to use their ship (which wasn’t a particularly useful mode of transport in the original) and it leans into the Viking fantasy of longship exploration.
* The map would be presented visually as a map of Northern Europe from the Viking perspective, created by cartographers at the time.
* You can travel between regions by sailing in that direction off-map (e.g. *Black Flag*, *Rogue*) or zooming into that region on the map to get the more detailed view (similar to how the world map functions in *Witcher 3*).
* This also helps explain why distances and land masses are skewed in the game — because they’re skewed on the map and in this Viking retelling.

You wouldn’t create just one ‘settlement’.

* Norway would serve as the ‘base’ of operations, but you set up ‘outposts’ in the different regions (England, Ireland, France, etc.). There is less emphasis on settlement building and more emphasis on nomadic exploration.

Looting and jomsvikings would serve a deeper function in the game.

* Leveling-up would not be a solo endeavor based on gaining XP through story and side missions. It’d also involve accumulating resources through raids, recruiting and developing jomsviking and building out the settlements.
* Similar to how you can have different ‘builds’ for the protagonist based on different objectives, you can create different ‘builds’ for your jomsviking that are more or less helpful depending on the archetypes of different regions in the game.

Vinnland would be a DLC.

* Instead of being a small region in the base game, Vinnland would be a much larger region introduced as DLC.
* It seemed jarring in 2020’s *Valhalla* that you could jump back and forth from North America like it wasn’t a huge distance and effort for a Viking longship. It was also odd that you would visit this region before Ireland or France, which are far closer to Ravensthorpe.
* Instead, I think this arc should be presented as an epilogue for Eivor. Considering that >!she is buried in North America!<, it would be befitting that this arc is a farewell to Ravensthorpe and explains how and why she settled in North America. It’s not unprecedented that and *Assassin’s Creed* DLC tells a story set a few years into the future, e.g. *Assassin’s Creed Syndicate: Jack the Ripper* DLC.
* You would be able to jump back-and-forth between Vinnland and the base-game map, but you’re jumping between different ‘manuscripts’ telling stories of Eivor at different periods in her life.

You can kill the monks.

* This *Valhalla* would bring back the ‘wanted’ / bounty system from *Odyssey,* with the zealots. Killing monks would increase the wanted meter faster, but it’s not a Viking fantasy if you’re ‘game over’ whenever you intentionally / accidentally kill a monk.

It would be called ‘Assassin’s Creed Legends: Valhalla’ (see above).

—

***Assassin’s Creed Syndicate***

Evie would be the sole playable protagonist.

* She acts and operates like a more traditional Assassin. Her objectives are more in-line with the Creed.
* By the time *Syndicate* was released, *Assassin’s Creed* was overdue a female-protagonist game.
* Splitting the story between two characters undermines the character-building for both characters, and they end up one-dimensional.
* Jacob’s actions in the story are more a hinderance than a help to their overall objectives.
* The story would focus even more on the socio-political issues of the time, such as child labor, poverty, and the stark class divides, making it a more grounded and realistic narrative.

The tone would be much darker:

* The historical setting of Victoria London should be dark and gritty. It was a grim time for many people, and it was literally dark and gritty from the Industrial Revolution pollution.
* Jacob’s light-heartedness jars with what should be a grim backdrop. This is another reason why Evie should be the sole protagonist.

Essentially, the changes they made for the *Jack the Ripper* DLC should be applied to the whole game.

—

***Assassin’s Creed II***

Rename to “*Assassin’s Creed Dynasty*”

* Reflects the mantle of Assassin being passed down through the Auditore family.
* Reflects the dynastic powers at the time — the Borggia, the Medici.

—

***Assassin’s Creed III***

Rename to “*Assassin’s Creed Revolution*”.

* Reflects the American Revolution setting.
* Reflects Connor revolting against >!his father’s legacy as a Templar!<.
* Disadvantage is that it sounds a lot like the preceding title, *Revelations*.

—

***Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag***

* Just name it *Assassin’s Creed Black Flag.*
* Otherwise perfect, no notes.

—

***Assassin’s Creed Unity***

Rename to 'Assassin’s Creed Liberty'.

* ‘Unity’ only made sense in relation to the multiplayer, not in relation to the game’s storyline.
* ‘Liberty’ reflects the values of the Creed, and reflects the “liberté, égalité, fraternité” French motto.
* Disadvantage is that it sounds like *Assassin's Creed Liberation*.
* ‘Fraternity’ would have been a good alternative to be able to reflect the Brotherhood and the multiplayer aspect of the game as well as “liberté, égalité, fraternité”, but it probably has too many connotations relating to college fraternities.

—

***Assassin’s Creed*** ***Origins***

Rename to 'Assassin’s Creed Legends: Legacy'

* ‘Origins’ is used instead for a new addition to the franchise, above.
* Bayek would not >!found the Hidden Ones (or Assassins)!< at the end of the main storyline, but instead provides inspiration for the Brotherhood and the Creed. That is his ‘legacy’.
* Disadvantage is that ‘Legends: Legacy’ is a bit of a tongue-twister.
* Alternatives are 'Assassin’s Creed Legends: Echoes' (echoing into the future of the Brotherhood) or 'Assassin’s Creed Legends: Book of Dead' (long-winded, but Egypt-related and sounds like an assassin's kill-list).

367,1ea3e9m,K0nKBS,1721726375.0,Assassins Creed Twitter posted this message to their Japanese community ,656,289,"To our esteemed Japanese community - a message from the Assassin's Creed Shadows development team.
First, we want to express our heartfelt thanks for all your support for the Assassin's Creed series which now has its own history spanning almost 20 years.
Over this time, we have explored various settings, time periods, and characters, from an Assassin during the Third Crusade to a Viking in 9th century England, and countless more.
For many of our team, creating an Assassin's Creed game set in Feudal Japan has been a long-cherished dream.
Since the announcement of Assassin's Creed Shadows, we have received many positive reactions, but also some criticism including from you, our Japanese players. We share your passion for history and deeply respect your care for the historical and cultural integrity of your rich heritage.
We would like to address a few points to clarify our intentions and creative decisions:

Overall Authenticity efforts:
We have put significant effort into ensuring an immersive and respectful representation of Feudal
Japan.
However, our intention has never been to present any of our Assassin's Creed games, including Assassin's Creed Shadows, as factual representations of history, or historical characters. Instead, we aim to spark curiosity and encourage players to explore and learn more about the historical settings we get inspired by.
Assassin's Creed Shadows is first and foremost, designed to be an entertaining video game that tells a compelling, historical fiction set in Feudal Japan.
Our team extensively collaborated with external consultants, historians, researchers, and internal teams at Ubisoft Japan to inform our creative choices.

Despite these sustained efforts, we acknowledge that some elements in our promotional materials have caused concern within the Japanese community.
For this, we sincerely apologize.
All game footage presented so far is in development and the game will keep evolving until launch.
Based on the constructive criticism we have received, we will continue our efforts until we put this game into your hands - and beyond.
We also want to clarify that while we have been consulting with many people throughout the development process, they are in no way responsible for the decisions that are taken by the creative teams in the interests of gameplay and entertainment.
Consequently, we respectfully request that any criticism not be directed at our collaborators, both internal and external.

Creative Liberties and Historical Inspirations:
While we strive for authenticity in everything that we do, Assassin's Creed games are works of fiction inspired by real historical events and figures. From its inception, the series has taken creative license and incorporated fantasy elements to craft engaging and immersive experiences. The representation of Yasuke in our game is an illustration of this. His unique and mysterious life made him an ideal candidate to tell an Assassin's Creed story with the setting of Feudal Japan as a backdrop.
While Yasuke is depicted as a samurai in Assassin's Creed Shadows, we acknowledge that this is a matter of debate and discussion. We have woven this carefully into our narrative and with our other lead character, the Japanese shinobi Naoe, who is equally important in the game, our dual protagonists provide players with different gameplay styles.
We greatly value your feedback and encourage you to continue sharing your thoughts, respectfully. While we understand that meeting everyone's expectations is very difficult, we sincerely hope that when Assassin's Creed Shadows launches on November 15, players in Japan and around the world will appreciate the dedication, effort, and passion we have poured into it.

369,1e9q0is,pizzapockets1234,1721683726.0,What is the siege team doing?,43,41,"First of all I think the biggest question is what does the siege team actually accomplish on a daily basis? The game is so full of bugs and problems and even the small ones will remain unfixed likely for weeks/months, even something as simple as the last spawn on skyscraper having no name. 

The game is completely unplayable due to cheaters on pc which once again I see no progress on, my entire ranked 5 stack including me have quit the game until we can actually play a single legit game without a cheater which currently isn’t even remotely possible. 

The support is a absolute joke, me and my stack lost over 200+ elo to obvious spin botters/ 
rage cheaters but we’ve never got any rollback, I recorded the match replay of some of these people and spent hours collecting the names of all the cheaters and all the people they are intentionally boosting from copper to champ with their cheats (about 50 accounts in total) and it’s been about a week with not even as much as a response on my support ticket and I think anybody who has ever had to use ubi support can vouch how awful it is 90% of the time and it usually ends up in them saying “we do not have the ability to help with this issue” or something to that extent. 

Everytime they post anything on social media the comments show a major majority of the community is unhappy and feels unheard and ignored, not many people are discussing it but I also find it kinda wild in the middle of all these cheater problems Ubisoft gave a twitch streamer charm to a person who was previously banned for cheating. 

The servers are down literally all the time or lagging which they don’t even compensate the playerbase for anymore. 

Lastly it’s pretty obvious nobody is listening or working on balancing anything, before the shield buff I think most people were fine with how the shields worked, that was until ubi decided to “nerf shields” but all they did was make them annoyingly overpowered and unbalanced and with some practice and a tiny bit of luck they can easily get you many many kills where before they were more of a support operator and weren’t so painfully OP.


TLDR/Conclusion 

So for all these reasons I can say from my perspective at least, the siege team is not working on fixing bugs, stopping cheaters, providing useful support, banning boosted accounts, boosters/boosting services and cheaters, player relations and keeping the playerbase happy, maintaining stable servers or properly balancing operators (especially shields). 

So what are they working on? What are they doing? The game is falling apart and there isn’t a single aspect they seem to be working on so what exactly are they even doing all day besides sitting down at their desks and staring into space? They have some major problems with the game, none of which they appear to have any urgency or interest whatsoever in fixing or working on, at this point a job at Ubisoft isnt looking too bad, at least you know you’ll never have to get any work done and when half the playerbase is quitting due to developer incompetence you’ll continue to get your paycheque for sleeping in your office for 6 hours and going home 💀

It seems the only thing they focus on is making and selling cosmetics which they can’t even do right because recently all the skins they’ve been making have been awful ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1e9q0is/what_is_the_siege_team_doing/
370,1e774ya,N_Lightning,1721404517.0,I managed to get online on Steam version working!,18,13,"https://preview.redd.it/v3fc2rv3nhdd1.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8050ffe3d57c4d293a6ce4531da4b06e3efee8c

So, as you might know, if you have Watch Dogs 1 bought from Steam, it might not have an access to online functions of the game due to a bug in an access-granting algorithm. As others say, your account doesn't receive a key allowing you to connect to the servers. So I'll leave here a small guide on how to get Ubisoft to grant you this access. Feel free to message me if you'll have more questions.

0. Step zero is to make sure that this is a really problem with your account and not with your network. I mean, I've just managed to access online through the laptop that is connected to Wi-Fi distributed by phone connected to mobile network, so you can easily assume it, but still because of some steps, I'd like to recommend you to check if you get the same problem on another device connected to another network. If the problem persists then almost certainly the problem is your account

1. Open a case on Ubisoft site: [Link](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/contact). It's advisable to immediately write them that your problem is persisting and most certainly have a deal with your account and the game not being bought on Ubisoft

1.5. Now you're waiting. I got the first response after **3 weeks** and it was automated warning about closing the case. Answer it however you want, just don't let the case be closed

2. After I saved the case from closing, it took other **1,5 weeks** to get a response from a real person. Now they will most certainly ask you to try various troubleshooting steps, run few tests and send them results, despite you telling them that it's a problem not with your hardware. It's normal, this is part of their instructions. It's better to send them what they're asking for. As for troubleshooting, if they ask for too much (like rerouting ports, enabling uPnP, resetting software) you can just write them that you've done it. I mean, for them it's just a checkbox, they're obliged to ask it, so why would you strain yourself because of it. You can repeat that your problem is with your account and not hardware, it won't have an immediate result, but it might lead to them turning blind eye to some tests. If you'll encounter some stubborn support that keeps you stuck on one step, just send a message after a day, you most certainly will get another support who might be more yielding.

3. Now you message them until you receive the ""golden message"". It's better to not answer anything

4. Now I'd advise to check your mailbox daily to assure that your case won't get closed. Also check the status of it. When it changes to ""escalated"" you can stop warring and just wait for the ""specialists"" to review it

https://preview.redd.it/5j0szlroxhdd1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f75eece4d11aa516d21d59edd444c4c5d56ebc9

5. After some time (in my case a little more than **a month**) you'll receive a message that, I hope, will solve your problem

Note: The key they sent to me didn't give me a new copy of the game, it made my old copy (Steam one) that didn't have a key (can be checked in game properties in Ubisoft Launcher) receive it and gain access to multiplayer:

> How much was Ubisoft involved in the creation of the novels? Did they give you complete creative freedom, or were you given some story beats to work with? Such as the *Omega Protocol* in Dragonfire?  
  
*I worked closely with Ubisoft to synch up the events of the novels to match their future plans for Splinter Cell, including the planned Netflix animated series, but they gave me a lot of freedom to develop the main beats of the story. The Omega Protocol was something I developed.*  
  
> Will there be any more Splinter Cell novels coming from you? Will you have the chance to work on the series in the future? (I know I'd like to see it!)  
  
*As far as I know, there's no current plans for more Splinter Cell books, although I would love to come back and write more if Ubi want me.*  
  
> As a fan, what would you like to see from the series in the future since it's been dormant for so long? (Blacklist sequel, remasters, etc)  
  
*I really want to see what will be done with the Netflix anime, and I will definitely play the remaster. But what I'd really love to see is an all-new SC game.*

*I like his grit and his humour, his inherent honour and toughness.*

*Yeah, I've been a gamer all my life. I play a lot of FPS/TPS titles, all the SC games of course, plus other Clancy games like The Division and Ghost Recon.*  
  
> What other pieces of media served as inspiration for Firewall and Dragonfire? (films, other games, etc)

Hi everyone,

I’m in a tough spot and could use some advice. My Ubisoft account was recently compromised, and the email associated with it was changed without my consent. Now, I’m unable to access my account or reset the password because I don’t have access to the new email.

Here’s what I’ve tried so far:
- Attempted to submit a support ticket using a different account, but it didn’t go through.
- Reached out through other support channels, but haven’t received a response
-Attempts to submit a support ticket result in an anonymous email for verification, which I cannot access.""

 Situation:
- Compromise Date: Around 5 days ago
- Issue: Email address changed, and i can no longer change it.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Any tips on how to escalate this issue or get in touch with Ubisoft support effectively?

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions!

I did not include lieutenants, because so many can be recruited during gameplay that it would be too much.

This has been the order since the beginning, when weekly quests started in October of 2018, but it was not that easy to figure out. For some reason the 1st. year anniversary event where they released one a day over the course of a few weeks left out two ships (the Artemision and Tartessos). But, the order has resumed to the way it was from the start. So, if you're missing the Artemision and Tartessos ships, now you know what order they'll appear in, so keep on the lookout! I started the order with The Black Wind, because it appears that was the very first weekly bounty on a ship, and it started from there, but has cycled through ever since in this order (except for the anniversary event).",https://www.reddit.com/r/AssassinsCreedOdyssey/comments/1e1mhuf/here_is_my_complete_list_of_ship_cosmetics_from/

I purchased Ghost Recon Breakpoint about a year and half ago on steam and ultimately decided to refund it at the time. Since then, I have heard it has gotten several major updates that improve the game dramatically. So I decided to give it another try with this steam sale and purchased the ultimate edition. After downloading, I get the error, ""There was a problem authentication the ownership of this product. Please contact customer support if you need help in solving this problem.""

I check their website, and it says make sure you are logged into your correct Ubisoft account I double-check that (also I purchased Far Cry New Dawn in the same transaction, and it worked fine) so I knew this was not the issue. So I opened a case with their ""Customer support"". Since then, I have been told 3 times to double-check the account. Another 3 times that my internet must be having problems on the pc that I am literally messaging support with. 6 times they requested proof of purchase, (please note I went through their steps on all of these and sent screenshots every time.)

Another 3 times, they emailed to verify ownership of my account. I c;licked the link in the email to verify the account then when if finally seemed like a human responded and said hey it looks like the game was refunded by steam over a year ago lets see if we can get this resolved please give me your email and steam ID to see if I can fix the link (please not this is the 5th time in the back and forth that I have given my steam ID). I did that, then the next response is a request for my Ubisoft launcher logs (for the third time). Then another verification and after that they said it looks like the game was refunded so we are going to close this unless you have any other questions which of course I did because my problem was still not resolved.

Then they said ok, let's do proof of purchase again. BTW, they got the game wrong twice in this chat and I had to correct them multiple times. Finally, it looks like I am being escalated hopefully to a human being because there is no way I have been communicating with a human this time (please note that each of these messages have taken about 30 minutes to respond to me). Ubisoft if you see this please get your crap together I don't want to have to refund this game again I want to play it, but this is an absolutely terrible experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1dr01kq/psa_be_very_careful_refunding_ubisoft_games_on/

381,1do4z6o,Substantial_Show7485,1719319098.0,New Blood: The Season of Rampant Cheating in Rainbow Six Siege?,5,2,"Hey everyone,

It looks like this season of Rainbow Six Siege, ""New Blood,"" is swarming with more cheaters than ever. Right from the start, I ran into five blatant cheaters back-to-back. The situation has only gotten worse, with more and more wall hackers cropping up. It's bizarre seeing players with Champion ranks who move and play like they're completely new to the game, clearly relying on cheats.

Since the season kicked off, I've been keeping track of every cheater I encounter, whether they're blatantly cheating or trying to look legit. So far, I'm up to 14. Shockingly, only one of these guys has been banned. I've also noticed that these cheaters tend to queue with the same accounts to boost their ranks, and strangely, these accounts aren't getting banned either. Some of these cheaters even kill themselves on purpose in some matches, probably to switch accounts and keep cheating. I think they might also be trying to keep their kill-death ratios low to fly under the radar. Are they using new methods to avoid getting caught?

This has got to be the worst season ever with bugs and cheaters swarming everywhere. And what's Ubisoft's brilliant response? Oh, just slap on a new membership option, because why fix the game when you can just milk more money out of us, right? Lol, it's like they're not even trying anymore.

Has anyone else noticed this uptick in cheaters? Any thoughts on how they're managing to avoid bans?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1do4z6o/new_blood_the_season_of_rampant_cheating_in/

As a gamer who grew up on the old Assassins creed games
AC1, AC2, Brotherhood, Revelations 
Such foundation lead me to Splintercell conviction, through conviction i learnt of double agent, CT, pandora tommorrow and blacklist. 

And i loooved them. 
I became hooked on the games Ubi were putting out, GRAW, GRAW2 future soldier, if its Ubi related chances are ive played it. 


But its gotten to a point for me where i watch a gameplay trailer of something new, i cant enjoy it. 
Because what i see is Ubi playing it safe.

They allowed splintercell to Die. 
Infact judging by their new star wars game to come out i DARE judge and say half the movement from that game is just Re-used splinter cell animations
And with that leads me to my next point. 

Ever since AC originals they turned AC into a clunky video game. 

I realise acs always had a bit of a clunky system 
But i say the earlier work was due to hardware limitations, but they dropped unity what was fluid, dynamic, responsive. 

To then go back to this mess of a system. 
Not to mention AC shadows, basically ripping for honors combat animations. Which looks clunky and messy. 

I just feel as if Ubisoft have settled into being the new EA or 2K games. 
Peddling out the same crap with a new addition to the title 😂
Anyway thanks for getting this far. 
Feel free to let me know how you feel, love to know if im not the only one whose noticed or feels the same way. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Splintercell/comments/1dn88t1/i_honestly_cant_be_excited_by_a_new_ubisoft_game/
385,1dk9vpj,NoobGamer880088,1718884865.0,Valhalla 100% Completion Achieved. My Final thoughts,52,28,"Hi All. I wanted to share my thoughts after wrapping up Eivor's journey in AC Valhalla. Got Best Ending.

As a completionist aiming to 100% every game I play, Valhalla took 390 hours (tracked via external app) or 230 hours (game time) too 100% beat it. All side activities everything etc.

Attaching some pics at the end.

# My Eivor's Journey:

* Male Eivor. Red Head Long hair-beard.
* Romanced Petra (Vikings would love hunters). 
* FAMILY COMES FIRST. ALWAYS. Remained faithful to Adoptive family, brother Sigurd & sister-in-law Randvi. Yeah, declined all suggestions of Randvi romance. But did have casual fling with Brodir.
* Decimated enemy troops with my standard equipment: Gae-Bolg, Odin's Spear Gungnir, Dokkalfar's Hunter bow, Petra's Arc Predator bow, Viper Light bow, Fallen Hero Gear. All at Platinum quality max upgraded.
* Always chose Paragon/Olive branch responses.
* Most attractive opposite gender people, I wish Eivor could romance: Ciara, Toka.
* Main Villain: Loki/Basim. Others I hated: Ivaar Ragnaarson, Sinmara

Now I will share the Cons & Pros I felt about AC Valhalla

# Cons:

1. Way too long & bloated. My Odyssey 100% was finished at 2/3rd time of Valhalla.
2. Grindy (Mastery Challenges, River Raids). 
3. I dislike Rogue like mechanics as its immersion breaking (Forgotten Saga)
4. Least Stable Ubisoft game I've ever played. Crashes/Hangs even though I can run at 60+fps at max settings at 1440p or even 4K. Using a RTX 4070.
5. Side quests (mysteries, anomalies, fly agaric etc) are too vague. I had to use YT & forums way too much to find ""what is even being asked of me"" or ""get direction"". As a 90s gamer, I've beaten Tomb Raider 1-6 & other puzzle games so I'm no slouch.
6. Many things felt like Filler activities
7. Most armor pieces were too ""gaudy"" esp at Highest Trim level with too much Gold accents. felt like Eivor is going to a party. Looks wise, I loved a few & stuck with those like: St. George (Knight), Fallen Hero (Definitive Hero armor), Thor (Norse God), Byzantine, Paladin, Brigantine
8. I felt bad for Layla, she merely acted as a courier for the Staff of Hermes. 
9. Eivor Varinson should be name for male Eivor. Having to select gender is good for diversity & I'm totally OK with it, just don't force ""Varinsdottir"" on those who want to play a Male Viking.
10. Odin's story with his son, fate of his kind was very depressing.

# Pros:

1. Music. OH MY GOD the music is awesome. Valhalla ranks 2nd after Odyssey with overall music scores out of all AC games (yeah, I've played ALL of them excluding Mirage). Favorite: Main theme, KIngdom of Wessex, Asgard Open Sky Door etc). Overall, a 9.5/10.
2. The grim, depressing, dark tone of story & Eivor's arc resonated with me. Loved it.
3. Best Inventory management of the Layla Trilogy (origins, odyssey, valhalla). No need to replace my gear or be overburdened like Odyssey
4. England is beautiful. So is Ireland, Francia somewhat. 
5. England ambience. I've played other games like Forza Horizon 4 (Race), Avernum 3 (my fav RPG) all of which are set in/use British lore and Valhalla reminded me of them too.
6. Very good weapon variety & kill animations
7. Lots of variety in gear (armor, weapons).
8. Kassandra crossover. Melisanthi Mahout should have voice acted that. Same with Randvi's voice actor in the DLCs.

386,1djaa6o,goal_dante_or_vergil,1718770354.0,"Reminder: the Creative Director for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Jonathan Dumont, was directly named as a sexual abuser by female Ubisoft employees in 2020. Instead of being punished, he was instead rewarded by being made Director.  ",4,38,"I have a feeling that this whole debacle about the black Samurai, Yasuke, is just a way for Ubisoft to deflect attention away from the fact that the Creative Director for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Jonathan Dumont, was directly named as an emotional and sexual abuser by female Ubisoft employees in 2020. 

Dumont has been accused of “verbally abusing and making sexual advances toward his colleagues, particularly women and new starters.”

A report from Game Developer into alleged abuse Ubisoft found that Dumont was, according to multiple sources, ""abusive and controlling"" and ""one of the biggest offenders"" at the company. The workers who spoke to Game Developer claim that Dumont would throw objects, punch walls, and be verbally abusive, using slurs that would reduce his targets to tears. He was even said to tell women how they should dress.

""[He] pushes people to the edge of their mental health regularly, and tries to justify his behavior by saying 'this is how you get things done.'"", said a source speaking to the publication. ""[He makes] various misogynistic and homophobic comments, and when he's called out on them will come out with defenses like 'my mother left my father when she realized she was a lesbian, so I know what I am talking about.'""

“Dumont has been responsible for many developers leaving Ubisoft altogether, due to his alleged outbursts “creating a climate of fear.”

""Dumont has been the reason [for] multiple of my colleagues leaving,” the A Better Ubisoft member tells us. “Be it because of sexual advances, belittlement, fear of him, or having seen his behaviour when in a bad mood. His outbursts have created a climate of fear known for years in the studio and failed to be acted on for a long time.”

The source also shares that while Dumont has made an effort to “improve himself”, his alleged past actions “are still very fresh in the mind of many”. As a result, “some in the Quebec studio have asked not to work on Red because of his position on the project.""

This seemingly contradicts Ubisoft's recent claims at a briefing in Paris this Thursday. ""Yes, we stumbled. And we have acknowledged that,"" said Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. ""We learned a lot along the way, and have made meaningful progress with concrete action plans.""

In a statement to TheGamer, Ubisoft provided another response from Guillemot, stating that anyone who was accused of abuse but remains at the company has been ""appropriately disciplined.""
