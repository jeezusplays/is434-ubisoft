1,5,Nice place to work,Senior programmer,"Great people, good work-life balance.",Relatively low salary compared to other company.
2,4,"Great work culture, welfare and people, but low compensation",Junior gameplay programmer,"- Comp time for OT - People are great, work culture is respectful - Inter-project mobility. I never hear of people being let go at the end of a project","- Bonuses are basically non-existent so far during my time here. Company wasn't doing well last year. - The pay raise last year was extremely low, at 1.7% for me, and it is known that there were 0% increases for certain job levels. - In my project, it felt understaffed but overdemanding. All of us had to do more than was healthy for work-life balance, and even though there was comp time for OT, not being able to spend all of it was an actual concern as the project could not afford some people to leave. It should be noted that I have never heard of leave being unapproved for this reason however, but there is stress coming from expectations and sense of responsibility to consider."
3,4,Comfortable enough,Ui artist,"Depends on the team, but I am given a lot of freedom on how to solve tasks. HR Does take care of people and organises events for welfare.",Short timeline means you fix stuff even if it's spaghetti code or temp fixes.

You can thank the COD egomaniac (a perverse, sexual predator who talks and eats more than he delivers).

Ongoing racism and discrimination toward Singapore team members. No accountability, toxic to the core.

Devs work hard to meet some crazy expectations.","Micromanagement of every level especially from HQ Non-expert mavericks exist - who will disregard real expertise, these are often production and HQ self declare experts in all fields from anything like tech , design, art and making AGILE changes but are actually going in circles - which are obvious. Top layer clearly oblivious to on the ground realties. Too many directors and directors of directors lost touch on game dev processes. Lots of fuss on minor subjective details that make a game Costly to realize the egos of these higher ups. Poor accountability for mistakes made Your opinion and decisions don't matter since there will be someone above who will randomly undermine it New age moral policing that will stifle a innovative culture Salaries can't keep up with inflation"

(2 years at junior, 4 at intermediate, 5-6 at senior

Bloated dev teams that arent open to hearing ideas for a game's direction. Most major decisions are dictated by the HQ studio. You end up feeling like a cog in a machine and eventually lose interest in the product.

Creativity takes a backseat to ways to get more and more money out of the player after the sale of the product. In the past youd have a creative director but now you have a committee of finiancial and engagement members that have tunnel vision on specific metrics and it makes the product much worse as a whole.

modern ubisoft games introduce a lot of addictive gambling elements aimed at kids.my morals dont align with that

Very Low salaries.

Glass ceiling in the company if youre not a french speaker or national.

A lot of french conversations on the floor even though it's supposed to be an English speaking company. Groups seem to form based on this and it factors in during performance reviews if youre very close to the french group

Project bonsues are tiny. On a game released in Ubisoft' most profitable year ever, selling over 10 million units. The bonus was less than a month's (already slow) salary for a 4 year projects lack of manpower for projects"

54,4,Short review,Designer,The culture for the company is great and fun.,The pay for the company is not that high.
55,4,Great Environment for those who want to make a difference!,Anonymous employee,"Open environment - Really helps on communication. Just take the initiative, anyone from senior management to junior employees are always willing to talk. Great Business Mind - Talk to more people who manages projects, department(s) and studio. You will pick up more knowledge about the company and business direction. The future of the organisation is bright in this competitive industry. There are many senior guys whose first job start in this company. That explains! Knowledge sharing - A lot of time, effort and money is spent in development of knowledge and training of the employees. There are many workshops created developed especially in the last few years. Values a lot on sharing expert advice (internally and externally). Not many games developers are doing to this extend! Local Talent Development - The Singapore studio emphasis the importance of developing top local talent. That's a very good area to develop and strongly encouraged!","Works with multiple studios collaboration. A lot of functions works with various studios and offices. Can be challenging when it comes to time zone collaboration. Which MNC has no challenge on this? However, it is also good that every studio is learning from one another yet growing the expertise knowledge at the same time."
56,4,Okay place to work,Technical artist,Fun work environment. Good place to work,Salary can be better. Still higher than the competition i guess
57,4,Pretty Decent,Junior quest designer,Plenty of opportunities to broaden learning experiences,Long work hours at times
58,4,Great WLB,Publishing,Great WLB and leadership understanding,Could take more calculated risks
59,2,Incompetent Leadership begets incompetence.,Developer,Job security Good workplace culture Good work life balance Safe country,Leadership and Production management are generally incompetent. More focused on impressing upwards than they are motivating or empowering a team. Anyone with any experience in identifying problems is often stigmatized as negative and not working well with the team which is just leadership speak for shut up and sit down. Leadership is top down order driven less you incur the wrath of management and your career is stalled because they don’t like you. Promotion process is more a popularity contest on who has the best rumor about you. Milestone objectives are a joke to be spun into successes based on vague goalposts. Work gets redone and redone because leadership rarely has any idea on what work actually gets done because they are more interested in PowerPoint presentations than actual technical or production competency. Is it any wonder the turnover for senior developers is so high. Only a handful of devs in the studio who has been here longer than 5 years. The rest can find more fulfilling work elsewhere.
60,1,"Good people, bad management, uncertain future",Developer,"- Nice people. Most ppl have good attitude to work with. - Biggest game company in Singapore. - Good work and life balance, flexible hours. - High quality standard, always industry benchmark AAA titles. - Project has strong marketing and brand IP.","- Future is uncertain, project constantly change direction. - Management is not transparent, one hand claims everything is awesome, another hand is downsize the team. - Political, whoever talks the most or loudest gets to be heard. If you speak French you will got bonus influence. - Low pay, downgrade rank title, no career path. If you are French pay is much higher. - High turnover (both local and expat colleagues have high turn over rate). - The satellite studio Philippines and Chengdu studios making the Singapore most costly one. Production work has slowly shifted and leaving the employees with uncertain future in Singapore."
61,5,one of the strongest studios at one of gaming's best companies,Producer,"Ubisoft is the best of the bunch for big publishers in the video game industry as an employee. I appreciate the decentralized decision making (teams have a lot of autonomy), the values which extend all the way to the top of the company at the c-level (trust creative people, and they will do great things for you), and the support. The Singapore studio has exited its ""startup"" phase and is becoming a more mature studio - but hasn't lost its ambitions. It's still a place where I feel a lot of energy and enthusiasm when I walk through the doors every morning.","Every company has niggling issues - and Ubisoft is no exception. One of the big trade-offs is that game companies tend to be ""led"" by one group or another - design, tech, marketing, or business. At Ubisoft, its business and design. Which means that technology, for example, is viewed as a ""solution to specific problems"" rather than something that enables new businesses. If that's what you're looking for (hardcore R&D), Ubisoft is no Google."
62,1,Choose your friends wisely,Anonymous employee,"Ubisoft Singapore has, in the past, collaborated with other studios to create AAA games like the Assassin's Creed franchise. Great learning experience working on AAA titles.","The politics are incredible. Your skills account for 10% of your performance during the yearly review. The remaining 90% is dependent on who you are friendly with and who hates you. If a manager in the studio (not necessarily your manager) does not like you, he will find all sorts of excuses to have you fired. He will try to convince other managers that you are difficult to work with and if a majority of them speak out against you, you're out. On the flip side, if you're best buddies with your manager, he can find reasons to rally the other managers to his side and give you a promotion. Some have been promoted this way."
63,5,Life at Ubisoft,Anonymous employee,"Contrary to other Glassdoor articles, this company actually tries very hard to promote local talent - there are several examples of senior local talents in the company. Overall a very fair and vibrant company to work for. - Healthy mix of asian and western nationalities - Very casual working environment - Comparable salaries compared to other local game dev studios - Strong emphasis on team health during bi-annual lead reviews - Care is taken during scoping process to manage team workload - AAA game development on top IPs - The studio here is given a good amount of freedom to work on their own ideas","- Crunchtimes, but has gotten better in recent years - The bar is set high in this company; everyone is expected to perform - Bonuses are based on project sales, sometimes there are no bonuses - Annual leave is minimal - Salaries are not competitive for junior and intermediate positions - Benefits and healthcare are not amazing compared with local MNCs"
64,2,Great Talents killed by top management's politics & bureaucracy (Singapore),Anonymous employee,+ Nice work & life balance + Promoted easily based on senior relations + Nice people. Most ppl have good work attitude + Biggest game company in Singapore or Asia + Nice studio of friends (Junior to mid levels),"Unclear direction on game strategy which often led to conflicting priorities Senior Management had trouble acknowledging ownership or committing to new directions Very top-down or laissez-faire style by leaders which prevented honest conversation about problems Lack of coordination across functions due poor organizational designs Inadequate leadership time & attention given to talent issues (usually ignored or dismissed) Employees feared of telling the senior team about honest inquiries or opinions. (based on former employees being reprimanded or wrongfully dismissed) Observed long-term, loyal employees being overlooked by alliance relationships with Seniors (French) Very unclear career development Low salary High turn-over (3-5 employees left a month. Unannounced, terminated or resigned)"
65,3,Ubisoft Anonymous,Anonymous employee,"Very European place to work. Days are flexible, family comes first, and most every project is encouraged as a bottom up initiative, rather than a top-down mandate. This gives you lots of room to propose good ideas, and develop them within the company, regardless of your role or stature.","Because of that lack of top level guidance, you spend a lot of time negotiating and playing politics with other teams in the organization - building alliances and support to budget and execute projects that are cross functional, which can be great for someone who has the political clout to drive that, but if you're just interested in getting things done and not playing politics, it can be stifling."
66,2,A beginner friendly studio,Anonymous employee,Excellent learning opportunities Work is demanding in terms of time commitment but less so in brain power Great for portfolio,
67,2,"Good QoL culture, but lots of politics",Anonymous employee,"Good quality of life, competitive salaries, relative job stability, and they allow for a reasonable work life balance. The location is also an amazing place to live as well.","Very thick management layer, and most of them were never in the trenches so they tend to not know when an issue needs to be reacted to and when it's a minor thing. A great many bad decisions get made out of lack of technical knowledge and understand as they do not seem to trust their tech leads to properly advise them. The management layer holds all of the keys, and people on the team do not feel as though they are being heard."
68,1,New Army General in the Singapore Studio,Anonymous employee,Good starter for resume sake,"The new MD is an authority figure and wants only followers. Defy his orders/wishes means career suicide. Those who follows are pets (usually the incompetent) and that's happening from very senior people down to leads. Wants to brand himself as a ""hero"" but never had that capability to manage a company. It's only orders, orders, order. HR is genuinely a great team but lacks much empowerment. This company is losing a lot of local talent in the past years. So called AAA project is still unknown to release. Wants to a leading tech company but lacks comps, culture and senior people who can innovate. Weird that there are a lot of directors getting fat salaries actually don't get fired. Studio with BIG PROBLEMS!"
69,4,"Great company, cares about game(r)s",Anonymous employee,"Really cares about game quality High quality IP's (Far Cry, Assassin's Creed etc...) Not afraid to take calculated risks and invest in creativity A lot of international / relocation options Yves Guillemot a great CEO and a quality human being","Work life balance is still not where it should be at the end of projects. The top tier of the company is a small clique of friends/relatives from 30 years ago, some of them have not scaled alongside the company and don't quite have the professional ethics. As such, they tend to let things un-managed instead of making bold moves. This sometimes leads to situations getting worse overtime, and impacting many quality employees."
70,2,Forget about long term growth - Too much politics among the ranks,Anonymous employee,"The Singapore studio prides itself with a strong track record of successful games, notably as an associate studio contributing major features to the Assassin's Creed brand. Its early entrepreneurial spirit even led it to pioneer and champion the company's first major Online product Ghost Recon Phantoms. Developers here are extremely hardworking and passionate about their work, which can be exemplified by the titles that the studio has shipped.","The leadership is extremely cliquish and exclusive club. In order to succeed in your career, you can only either pull strings to be part of the club, learn to speak the same language or else you can only depend on your close allies to hopefully maintain your status quo. Leadership can also be extremely disorganized, with managers failing to perform regular 1:1s, set clear objectives or coaching direct reports into succeeding well. There's no transparency in communications. Requests often reaches the floor with hardly any impact analysis on tech or team's velocity, and ideas are changed flippantly and frequently. Culture has also shifted in recent years from that which was very family-like and people-centric, to that which is bottom-line and resource-centric. HR is mostly talk and no substantial action. Loyal and hardworking long-term staff (5 years or more) that decided to leave or got retrenched are often let go without compassion or renegotiations. Your fate is fixed by the club."
71,3,Time Bomb,Artist,"Stable, but if some competitor set up here, all good employee will flee.","Politics, French / Canadian have ++privilege and chances, subjectivity on promotion, paid based on nationality, HR is non-existant, 1 of 10 tech guy will be promoted and do all the work while 9 of 10 management will promoted because they all friends."
72,2,"Fun place, but swim carefully",Anonymous employee,"- Fun and vibrant environment - Experienced staff, you would be able to learn a lot from working with them - Pleasant and friendly colleagues who are willing to teach you - Accessible office, it's only a short 5mins walk from the Train station","- Office politics. Think Gun N Roses ""Welcome to the Jungle"" type of office politics. - No seriously, the song ""Welcome to the Jungle"" Describes the political situation in the office right down to a T."
73,3,Fun. Friendly coworkers. Multinational.,Animator,Friendly atmosphere. Promotes outside hobbies and activities for employees. Good amount of exposure to delve into specialties outside the employee's current field,Looks at the length of time spent in the company to consider promotion for its employees rather than the actual talents of its employees. Doesn't try much to retain employees. Will let them quit and then simply rehire new people.
74,3,"Great Place, Great Culture, Great Pool of Talent BUUUUUUT....",Animator,"- Fun people, great high profile projects, talented people. - Closely knitted bunch within the team - Free Beer and finger food on Fridays - Free overtime dinner compensations - Table tennis table","- Incredibly thick of office politics. Many cliques in the company - If you don't speak French, your pay scale is different. - Below average pay scale and yearly increments - Unclear career progression"
75,3,You can kill your time here,Anonymous employee,"Easy job, really. Not demanding due to follow-the-sun shifts and the corporate politics (that the team never gets any interesting work). You get to leave office at 5pm sharp.","A job too easy that gradually I burnt out. The other side, the bad side of leaving office at 5pm is that you come to the office at 9am. Even worse, it becomes 8am when daylight savings turns on in Europe and America, (though you leave office at 4pm)."
76,1,it could be better,Anonymous employee,"+ Nice people + Nice working environment and office location + Colleagues are very talented, you will learn a lot! + Good name in your resume",- Way much bureaucracy & politics at every level - Management is not transparent - Unclear direction usually obliterate the work - Slow to ship games (do not expect to see your name in there so easily) - Very high turnover - Low salary
77,3,Culture at Ubisoft,Anonymous employee,Ubisoft is a stable company to stay and work for. There are a lot of big titles that you can work at. and there are potential for growth. Its a culturally diverse company.,"Its getting more political especially if you want to move up. There are a lot of politics happening around. There are special treatment given to French people, its really biased."
78,2,Mediocre compensation,Junior technical artist,"Good training opportunities, maybe mentorship if you're lucky.","Salary disparity between junior and intermediate positions is huge. Company prioritizes experience by amount of games shipped above all else, disregarding actual skill level. Most software used is proprietary. People leaving every week, leading to experienced juniors teaching newer people with higher pay grades."
79,1,Stable but uninteresting,Technical director designer,- Job security - Lots of experienced peopel to learn from,"- Stuck in their ways - Low salary, only really given opportunities when threatening to leave - Projects are designed top-down, most people don't have any influence on the project and are just told what to do - Leads do not represent their team upwards, you're left fending for yourself - Relies a lot on people doing OT on a regular basis, but will not reward them - Very slow at decisionmaking"
80,1,Subtle racism and not-so-subtle misogyny,Senior product manager,None that I can think of right now.,"Worked at the Ubisoft Singapore office. It's all happy and fun times on the surface level, but when you stop and take a look around you, you'll notice that this place has been enveloped by a miasma of racism and misogyny. They pride themselves in having a multi-cultural crew. This is true, having employed people from a wide variety of countries. But this is just that - a statistic. Only one out of the ten or so top dogs and decision makers is actually local or from Singapore. Everyone else is a white, male French. There have been instances where the same bros were accused of harassing a junior employee. Said person was then relegated to another position, and was even considered to be promoted, just at another office in another country. This is just one of many incredibly degrading decisions made in this company swept under the rug and guised under the pretense of ""we are a family"" and ""we are inclusive"". Inclusivity and Familial bonds only exist for Frenchmen in this company. Skull & Bones, the game the studio has been working on has been a literal shipwreck for the past 8-10 years. Despite what the PR is saying to the public, it has been a game plagued (it still is) with management failures, indecisions, talent bleeding out and poached, and low team morale. I sincerely hope you think many, many times before joining this company, especially this studio. I have no ill will towards any of my former colleagues, they are the most talented people I've met, but its unfair that they are forced to remain in this sinking hole due to circumstance."
81,5,Fantastic Environment for Creatives!,Anonymous employee,"Great studio culture, energy & positivity So many talented people you can learn from Largest & most well-known game development studio in Singapore Ideas are welcome and appreciated Great work-life balance, flexible hours Opportunities to work on AAA projects that are significant in the industry Many opportunities for learning as long as you're keen! People always remember to have fun Awesome studio parties! Relatively flat hierarchy, friendly managers & bosses","More parties! Also, more allowance for recreation & skill development would be perfect, especially for creatives."
82,1,Massive turnover rate signals need for introspection,Anonymous employee,"Over the last three years, Ubisoft Singapore raised the bar in Singapore AAA game development. It produced Ghost Recon Online (now Ghost Recon Phantoms), one of the first wildly popular and financially profitable AAA games produced almost solely in Singapore. This proved that the local studio had the ""guns"" to make it big. It had talent. And it had nurtured even more talent through the grueling process of developing GRP. But please read on below.","Over the past year though a disturbing trend has been observed as more and more of that very same talent has begun to leave the studio in droves. Meanwhile ""positive"" glassdoor reviews that look suspiciously like they were written by the company's own HR department continue to appear. Perhaps it is time for some introspection Ubisoft Singapore. Ask yourself; how many of the GRP project managers, producers and game devs still remain in the studio? These were guys that worked 16 hour days. Persevered through 3 years of mad crunch. For little to no reward or profit sharing - and they still delivered. They became human capital investments that actually matured. They became the new talent base for future projecst. The studio's GRP-hardened veterans. They went through hell for their project and they didn't leave. Why are they leaving now? Do you think the trend can be easily dismissed, or is this part of a deeper cultural problem? What changed in the short year between the success of GRP till now?"
83,5,Producer,Anonymous employee,"Great projects focused on creativity People company, career growth is definitely possible International opportunities","Jobs are quite specific and the Tech is complex (ex: Several game engines, C++, online...). The game industry is demanding and competitive. It is not for everyone."
84,3,Strong history and good culture that is falling apart,Anonymous employee,amazing team mates and caring managers,"resistance to change low salary intimidation, fear"
85,3,Not bad,Programmer,Interesting projects Collaborations Lots of passionate people,"Sometimes they are too process oriented. To get good performance review you need to join in a lot of meetings, try talk a lot of people, basically the art of looking busy and active. Result doesn't really matter because result is team effort. Not a great salary."
86,5,Ubisoft Singapore,Anonymous employee,"- Great atmosphere to try things and meet nice people; - A lot very talented people from different parts of the world; - It is the only studio in Singapore that had significant successes in the past years (serveral Assassin's Creed games, TMNT, Ghost Recon Online). They have done in Singapore what no company was able to do before. People can work there and have a worldwide recognition. - Very much people focused;","- Still a young studio, has grown fast. Need to consolidate a few layers."
87,3,A good company to make triple A games with but get ready to be undervalued and underpaid,Level designer,The bond between colleagues and your respective teams is great and strong. The production pipeline is solid and clear.,Employees are often undervalued and underpaid. The management is bad at employee retention.
88,3,"Has very strong technical people, yet not appreciating them",Programmer,"- Fun to work, good culture - You have to work with talented technical people",- Feels underpaid (this may depend on where you came from) - Huge & dark politics cloud - Decisions and final calls are made by non-technical people (producers)
89,4,Recommended for good work life balance and team mates,Anonymous employee,"Good work life balance Great culture, great people, fun team Manageable workload Caring environment, good benefits","Good work life balance Great culture, great people, fun team Manageable workload Caring environment, good benefits"

After years of avoidance finally came out with a 100% work from home policy. People moved away, sold their houses, changed their kids schools. Not even 6 months later they turned around and said yeah ooops just kidding, loooool. and forced everyone back in office 2 days a week. Not even a year later they are now forcing everyone back in office 3 days a week. There's no free parking unless you arrive at 6am and taking the bus and metro for some if not feasible or possible. They fired all the long term people who worked in the gym for 20+ years and replaced them with a horrible 3rd party company and gave access to people outside of the organization. So the gym could have even more bros invade it. Everything they do is for $$$ and not for the benefit of the employees. 80% of the company shouts from the rooftops how their policies ruin their lives and they suggest we talk to mental health professionals to help us cope with the horrible changes they are constantly imposing on us. They say people want to come into office, but when it wasn't inforced hardly anyone did. I think that speaks for itself. They give fictitious reasons for their arbitrary policies. Good luck with that. I for one will not stick around to see this get even worse. Plenty of fully remote companies out there to work for."

150,4,Concerned for our future,Game designer,"Absolutely spectacular team members, ability to work remotely, my Lead is committed to healthy work/life balance","Top leadership is pushing a return to office without any data to back it up. I’m becoming more and more concerned that the decision being made by our company leaders are completely missing the mark. They continue to lay employees off and cut costs for profitability, but then accrue costs by renovating new buildings, paying for commuting costs, losing hours of productive work time to commuting, and leasing expensive buildings to promote collaboration that we already have through digital environments. None of the changes make any sense to anyone in the company accept the CEO, who can’t provide any evidence that adding these costs will improve actual productivity."

Compensation: Compensation is not crazy but it is also not bad compared to the Montreal average. 3. Internal Mobility: There are plenty of opportunities for internal mobility. You can move around. 4. Offices: The office is space at St Laurent is very well equipped and easy to access from Metro or Bus.,"1. Transparency: The company is not good at communicating the status of senior leadership strategies or its financial outlook. 2. Turnover: Many teams get laid off with almost no notice. 3. Management: At times it can feel highly corporate, even more than some banks and telecom companies. Management and HR align to treat you as a number rather than to develop your career potential."
154,4,"(Mobile) Good projects and people, low salaries",Lead programmer,- Fun and ambitious projects to work in (mobile) - Plenty of challenges and opportunities to learn and grow - A lot of ownership - Great people and friendly environment,"- Low salaries - Lack of resources can put a lot of pressure on the team - Ubisoft HQ doesn't care much about mobile, but at the same time the studio depends on them and their decisions - Office poorly communicated and mandatory 3 days per week at the office"
155,4,Almost the Perfect Workplace- If Only Management Could Get it Together,Game designer,Everyone at the studio is incredibly warm and friendly and the benefits package is great (for now). Most managers are content to let you do your own thing while you're working as long as you get your tasks done. All of my people managers did their able best to support me in my career aspirations and assign me with tasks that they knew I would both enjoy and excel at.,"Upper management and the studio leadership is a mess at best and hostile at worst. HR is unnecessarily bureaucratic and makes advancing in seniority (and pay) nearly impossible. Their lack of flexibility leads to a seemingly arbitrary system of seniority, where employees of nearly 10 years are at the same level as those who have only been around for 4 despite having vastly disparate amounts of experience. Upper management have not only silently cut benefits (and staff) without informing employees ahead of time, but they then refuse to be transparent when asked to clarify their reasons for these decisions and if they've considered the consequences that will impact the teams as a result. Pay is also uncomfortably low to live in Toronto, especially considering the skyrocketing cost of rent and groceries. It doesn't seem like this issue is going to be fixed anytime soon- if you plan on working here, consider looking for a roommate."
156,3,"Interesting and new work, Work life balance, Low compensation",Junior programmer,"You will get the oppertunity to work with global studios and experienced/veteran developers Open door policy - you can contact any one even if person has 25 yoe and you are just an intern Cutting edge system Free ubisoft games Work life balance is pretty good, sometime you need to compromise when some deadline approaches but manageable,",Low opportunity to grow Compensation/hikes is very low

162,3,"Dwindling benefits, forced RTO with no regards to the impact on employees",Anonymous employee,"Great coworkers. Talented and generally very kind and welcoming. I can't speak for the entirety of the company, but I always felt comfortable in my team. Overall still good benefits. 5 weeks of paid vacation per year for all employees is nothing to scoff at.","RTO enforced company-wide by upper management. All employees will be required to comply to a new 3 days / week policy (with two fixed days and a third day that can be chosen by the employee). This includes employees who decided to move or even purchase a home farther from the city, due to previous WFH policy allowing this. Those employees are told to either sell their home to move closer, endure the brutal commutes (2+ hours one way), or simply leave the company. Not a single exception is allowed outside of people in categories protected by law (disabilities & such). This is enforced despite the international collaboration culture that was firmly in place. Many employees who entirely work with people located in other studios will need to endure traffic, expensive parking, and hours of time wasted only to then sit at their desk and join a Microsoft Teams meeting with coworkers overseas from a loud open office environment. Other benefits were cut during this announcement as well. A ""work from anywhere"" policy that allowed you to work up to a few weeks while traveling anywhere in the world was squashed entirely. They are also leaving the door open for adding to the 3/days per week. It is entirely possible for the RTO mandate to get worse in the future (4 days/week or even full in-office). Absolutely nothing positive was offered to employees to counteract the negative impact of the RTO. To top it off, everyone is worried over the company's poor current state. Stock is slumping. Star Wars Outlaws struggled to sell well. XDefiant is dying out. The only thing on the horizon right now is Assassin's Creed Shadows, and it has already been surrounded by controversy (whether justifiably so or not). This is weighing heavily on everyone's minds. Given all of this, it's really difficult to recommend this company to anyone right now."

Those that stay are talented, excited to work, happy to help, and want what's best for the games & players. - Decent benefits. - A good place to start your game development career. - A lot of opportunity to learn with some room to grow. Ubisoft (Toronto) was a very easy company to work for. I loved my coworkers, the projects always had great learning opportunities, and was mostly remote until RTO was mandated back. Over the years I got to work with incredibly talented folks and had ample opportunities to develop my skills and learn new technologies.","- Studio management and corporate management are hilariously out of touch and archaic practices of reviewing games are preventing Ubisoft from succeeding. - Pay is middling, raises are small, Toronto is expensive. - The upper levels of management will do Q&A's and pretend to listen, but don't actually care. - Silently cutting benefits, RTO, and laying people off without notice, while dancing around questions as to why this is happening. - The tech, while mostly good to work with, suffers from being almost entirely internal, meaning that it's harder to transfer your skills outside of Ubisoft as companies want you to work with publicly available tools. Management at the upper levels needs a massive shakeup. People fail upwards commonly, developers are not listened to at all, good games get cancelled, the review process needs a massive overhaul, benefits are being cut, questions aren't answered, people are being laid off, and games are consistently underperforming and upper management genuinely can't understand why. Ubisoft could be a game development powerhouse but creativity is throttled in the name of making more money."

232,5,Job related review,Ux/ui senior designer,"Working with this team has been an incredible experience. All my colleagues were highly skilled and talented on every project I've worked on, consistently delivering exceptional results. The collaborative environment fostered creativity and innovation, making it a pleasure to contribute to various initiatives. Everyone brought their A-game, and the diverse range of expertise within the team meant we could tackle any challenge head-on.","Working with this team has had its ups and downs. On the positive side, all my colleagues were highly skilled and talented on every project I've worked on. However, the company has significant issues that overshadow these positives. Firstly, there is always a problem with growth inside the company. HR frequently promises career advancement and growth opportunities after a specific period, which employees are led to believe. Unfortunately, these promises are rarely delivered. Despite these assurances, I received only a 2% raise, which did not reflect the inflation rate in my country, let alone my contributions and performance. Moreover, after successfully launching the project I was involved in, I expected to be assigned to a new project. Instead, I was informed there was no room for me on any other project, which was incredibly disappointing and left me feeling undervalued and uncertain about my future with the company. Additionally, the communication overload within the team was overwhelming, often hindering productivity rather than enhancing it. The resource allocation was uneven, leading to frustration and inefficiency. The decision-making process was also slow, as achieving consensus among so many skilled professionals was challenging and time-consuming. Overall, while the team itself is fantastic, the company's broken promises regarding growth and the lack of proper project allocation make it difficult to recommend this workplace."

Yes, even if you use an alias -- they want to police their employees for thoughtcrime that much. The ""wrong"" political opinion is ANYTHING that deviates SLIGHTLY From absolute wokism. They are quite literally the worst company I have ever worked at. If you are a straight white male, avoid as you WILL be discriminated against."

Some new Gen joiners behave like still going to college & don't adapt to the corporate work style due to which old managers need to suffer as HR now changed policies according to this new Gen people mindset. There is no one to care about the manager's mental health but just about the new Gen public. No respect for loyalty as they have an unwritten quote that ""Everyone is replaceable at any time."" they won't care about your career, impact on mental health anything."
252,2,Place of big contrasts,Junior game tester,Opportunity to work on extraordinary projects with passionate and talented people. Very solid work/life balance. Good workplace culture. Opportunities to grow. If you get lucky with a project life becomes a dream.,"But if you get unlucky though... Your experience massively depends on the project you work on. While some of them have amazing teams, interesting work, etc. other had none of the pros described above. I can't describe what incredible highs and utterly depressing lows I had depending on a project. The degree to which each team cultivated certain culture is comical. Some are friendly and family-like, others are extremely competitive and toxic, third are just apathetic. Amount of work also differs greatly and can be 2-5 times bigger or smaller without an exaggeration. Aaaaand... No matter the project compensation is completely unsatisfactory."

267,2,Tools Support Specialist in Ubisoft Annecy not the best opportunity,Tools support specialist,"- Hybrid work, - Chance for mobility - Flex office hours","- Salaries, the compensation in relation to tasks and a very expensive cost of life on this location(Annecy) makes it borderline for a Tools specialist. (lowest compensation among other French Ubi studios). - Outdated tools (not always the case as it varies from project to project, studio to studio) and old development practices which result in lengthy production times. - Management seems to be disconnected for the most part, doesn't seem to listen to their employees feedback and a lot of micromanagement which doesn't help. - They prefer to see skilled people leave and replace them than attempting to find solutions which is not reassuring. - Annecy, beautiful city BUT overcrowded for its size, the 3rd most expensive in France, excessive rents for old non maintained apartments, very low availability, everything in general is more expensive due to being touristic and close to Geneva which makes the quality of life problematic. - The office, overcrowded small offices, it feels like we are on top of each other."

Everyone seems to be very efficient and talented with what they do, friendly and passionate about their jobs. I feel very lucky for having been recruited there, I know how competitive the market is nowadays and how desirable is to work for a videogame company... it's a fun industry and people are nice, friendly, skilled and flexible. There are many internationals, a sign of richness and diversity. My manager is the best one I have ever had in +10 year career. Same for my team, I enjoy working with them, we overcome hurdles together and work closely to excel at what we do.","The company is huge and publishes many products every year, sometimes you can feel a little far from the core. I guess it also depends on the project you are working for, but it would be nice to see more employee engagement efforts across the various offices. Title changes/promotions take too long sometimes.

353,1,A cautionary tale of mismanagement at Ubisoft,Software engineer,"Good place to get some experience, but nothing more.","After years at Ubisoft, in both IT and Studio departments, I've seen a trend of mismanagement and directionless leadership. The main issue is with the department directors, often inexperienced and showing questionable decision-making skills, especially in IT. Working conditions deteriorated, leading to the downfall of promising products and the exit of skilled colleagues. Despite the toxic environment and poor leadership, I managed to focus on side projects, ironically receiving full bonuses for minimal effort. However, the mass layoff of over a hundred employees just before Christmas, paired with extravagant parties, highlighted the company's mismanagement. For those considering Ubisoft, especially in Montreal, better opportunities await in smaller, more dynamic companies."

Non-existent raises for three years straight (for everyone except managers). Bonus for the last year will be paid only after 6 month of the next year. Employee can get fired for mentioning the word ""salary"" during call with HR (real case). Higher managers are covering abuse and bullying of lower managers, absolutely no protection for the employees. Employee can and will get retaliation for reporting misconducts, managers and HRs will protect manager, not the worker."
358,1,A Challenging Experience at Ubisoft as a Recent Graduate,Tools programmer,******* ****** ****** ****** ******,"I joined Ubisoft as a Generalist Programmer (Recent Graduate) in 2022, excited about the opportunity to work in the gaming industry and it was a dream to be a part of this company. Initially, everything went smoothly, but I faced unexpected challenges later on. Instead of being assigned to a gameplay developer role as I had hoped, I was placed in the tools programmer team. Nevertheless, I embraced the new role with enthusiasm and gave my best effort. The real struggle began when I realized that my lack of previous experience was a significant obstacle. The team expected me to perform at the same level as seasoned developers and quickly learn complex systems they had developed over 15 years. Despite my dedication and willingness to learn, I faced tremendous pressure to match their expertise. Unfortunately, my senior colleague, instead of offering support and guidance, proved to be unsupportive. Instead of helping me adapt, he advocated for my removal from the team. This was a disheartening experience, as I had hoped for a more collaborative and encouraging work environment. It's important to note that my journey to Ubisoft was not a simple one. I underwent a technical test and interview, demonstrating my capabilities and enthusiasm for the role. However, despite my best efforts, I was ultimately let go, leaving me feeling that my time at Ubisoft was wasted."

(I do my best to find a pro),The tool architecture is awful which lead to poor performances for the users and it is a nightmare for the devs to improve this situation. The company seems to hate using standard tools and prefer to reinvent the wheel and do it poorly. So a simple task takes too many time. The worst is that many people working there for years are accustomed to this awful situation so they don't understand the need to improve this.

While there are some of the greatest people I ever worked with at Ubi, there are also a lot of the worst. Office politics, cliques and favoritism run rampant, and once you find yourself on the bad side of a superior you might as well resign, because it won't get better. Another thing I hated was the performance reviews : by company directive, a portion of your team (10-20%) HAD to be evaluated as below average and given a performance plan to improve. No matter how good the team as a whole was, or if there was anyone that actually underperformed. Sam was true for overperformers - only a few were allowed to be considered above average and only a handful in the entire studio were allowed to be given exceptional reviews.

Lots of people can bring lots of disorganized structure and mandates. Higher management is not accountable, benefits do not respect the lead of work that is dumped on the shoulders of lower stakeholders.
