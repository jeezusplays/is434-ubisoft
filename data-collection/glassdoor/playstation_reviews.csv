4,1,One of the worst,Anonymous employee,Small perks like freebies once in a while.,"50% of immediate co-workers are assassins who have no qualms backstabbing you to gain favour with the Japanese management. Japanese management side with each other and help each other to promote. Extreme favoritism and bias-ness, no career progression for you no matter how talanted you are if you don't bootlick them. Super manual jobscope that can be eliminated with better systems. Decent starting pay but you won't get any higher without bootlicking as well. Make tons of excuses to deny promotion yet promotion is granted to best friends and bootlickers who have minimal contributions. If you're new or young, forget about trying to make an impact as they deem you to be inexperienced and your word can't be taken for. Horrendous company."

Rigid rules, hierarchical, poor work-life balance, yes-man employees are preferred, etc. There is also bias based on gender and nationality which anyone can infer from their upper management structure. Internal processes and tools are manual and outdated, which is surprising for a tech company."

We aren't solving for world peace or saving lives so the stress isn't at a crisis level. There's just enough to fuel your days with some excitement. Working here is different than any company I have ever worked for. First, people of all backgrounds seem to want to work here--there is no shortage of people applying to our jobs. Second, we have incredible benefits at an affordable cost. And our benefits are expansive--IVF coverage, backup child care, etc. --amazing! Third, the people PlayStation is bringing in are best-in-class leaders who are helping shape the future of the company. It's a great time to join. Forth, we stand by the communities we live in. PlayStation committed $100M to social justice to improve lives and increase opportunities for underrepresented groups. Our commitment at PlayStation to DE&I is like nothing I have ever seen. Fifth and final comment: the people here are very supportive of one another and friendly. It's a happy workplace.","PlayStation at times can seem like a giant start-up. There's a lot of transformational work happening. If you are someone who wants to go where everything is perfectly laid out for you, this isn't the right place to work. Critical thinking skills are needed here, so if you don't want to use your brain, this isn't the gig for you."

It's a cool experience to gain so much insight","they are looking for scale, Not individual talent or skill. your growth matters little to them and most are treated as expendable. most people are kept as contractors for years longer than they should be. if you have a problem, then leave and they will quickly replace you -The Pay is on The low end of The spectrum -HR and Upper management is a joke when It comes to complaints about poor management or harassment.

133,2,Data Analyst role dressed up as Data Science,Data scientist,"- Work life balance is good and flexible working hours - Extra Christmas and summer company shutdowns (adds a few free days to your total holiday) - Good pension scheme (double contributions up to 10%) - Colleagues are generally nice (with a couple of notable exceptions at the manager level) - If you want a job where you won't learn or do much but want to have an easy 9-5 and get paid at the end of the month, PlayStation would be a good fit","- Work itself is more like a simple Data Analyst role but with the name Data Scientist, with little actual Data Science involved - Few learning and personal growth opportunities available - Slow moving and little innovation (due to company size, but also the kind of people who stay aren't ambitious due to the environment - the more driven employees leave) - A couple of the managers in the UK team are very inexperienced (and quite frankly, bad at their job) due to a couple of quick promotions to manager position and it shows - we recently had an anonymous department-wide survey (with lots of questions, but generally focussed on if you are happy in your job), and the Data Science team had the worst results in the department in which the team sits (of around ~10 other teams). I do see this as a manager-level issue (not director level - the director of the team is OK) - the managers seem to be out for their own gain and not for the gain of their direct reports"
134,1,Miserable Leadership / Terrible Work Life Balance,Manager,"A decent place to work if you're into games, but that's about it.","PlayStation (Sony) is a miserable place to work, and here is a non-exhaustive laundry list of why: 1.) Compensation: First off, compensation is weak and far from competitive with the market. My offer letter included no signing bonus, and there are no stock options for the vast majority of employees, even at the manager level. 2.) Work/Life Balance: Since the huge ""globalization"" effort, separation of work and life became impossible. I would wake up for 6 AM meetings and then take 10 PM meetings in the evening. Leadership did little to support a healthy work/life balance and would respond to people outside of working hours, expecting swift resolutions at odd hours of the day. When I was a Manager at Sony, someone on the Marketing Team took their own life. It took that tragedy for leadership to respond with resources and workshops for mental health. 3.) Out of Touch: Everyone director-level and up is a straight, white male that is insanely out of touch with the world at large and clueless to how other tech orgs of this size operate. As boomers, they feign a sense of care for DE&I initiatives, spew corporate poo poo words, and think that's enough to cover their butts. 4.) Cult-Like: If you're not into the industry, you are immediately ostracized like an outsider. Be ready to fake a passion for gaming or forever be an outsider to the cult. 5.) Org Hierarchy: The structure at Sony is extremely hierarchical, and employees are not empowered to make decisions. Instead, be prepared to be stifled for trying to innovate or implement change."

164,4,Overall good place to work,Software engineer ii,"1) WLB is off the charts great, IF you happen to find the right team. 2) Benefits were really nice! Free PS membership each year. Discounts on Sony products. 3) Probably depends on the team, but technology is progressive for the most part, and can be a good challenge. 4) Managers were emotionally very supportive.","1) The pay is lower than other companies 2) They don't allow fully remote, but do hybrid, depending on the bigger group you're in 3) Promotion is difficult, and some managers promote by the length of time you spend with that title. I saw other people around me get promoted without fulfilling the cultural requirements 4) HR is very slow to respond. 5) Some teams are definitely stretched thin, and could hire more so that deadlines can be met for dependencies."

Work hours all around the clock with teams in US, Japan & UK which leads to no work life balance. Things move very slow and projects take forever to launch.

247,3,Engineer,Software engineer,Fun place to work because you deal with PlayStation,Very uncompetitive pay because they use their name to pay you.

271,4,Way too much bureaucracy and process,Senior software engineer,"Rancho Bernardo office is beautiful. Employee cafeteria is on the 10th floor with a view to the ocean. Level 6, the Sony gym, is 100% subsidized and right on top of the parking garage, it's beautiful. In general the engineers are good to work with. Will pay for some people to go to offsite training, but the paperwork to get approval is outrageous. Fantastic relocation package. Decent profit sharing. (annual bonus)","Management won't allow upgrades of the technology even when it would benefit the bottom line. Up until this year they used C++98, a 21 year old compiler. (They moved to C++11) Claims to move projects to JAVA or at least micro services but never actually starts those projects. Sony back end services moved to AWS but won't allow teams to use the AWS suites without major reviews by ""architecture team."" Claims to have a sandbox area for engineers to experiment in, but it's so locked down nothing actually can run there. Low level management has no clue how to run a team. Mid level management spends 110% of their time in meetings. Upper management puts out great ""Dream of a new company"" speeches but doesn't move the company fast enough. Playstation 5 will be the last set top box and then the companies profit line is going to tank as cloud competitors eat their lunch. Says they don't do stack level ranking but they do. Performance reviews have almost noting to do with actual work performed."
272,5,PlayStation is a phenomenal place to work,Software it analyst,Great work culture with a strong outlook.,Career paths can take a long time to progress in.
273,4,Great if you're not focused on pay and ambition.,Global manager,Chilled out place to worked that supports remote working,Not the smartest people working here. Dated internal systems.
274,3,So much red tape I'm drowning,Systems engineer,Great team. Slowly building up collaboration and trying to build up proper infrastructure.,"Corporate IT Policies block production progress at every turn. There is a HUGE disconnect and lack of communication between departments. No one knows what anyone is working on, and not just in secret projects but in building up infrastructure. We need to be working on coming together and bridging the gap between IT and other departments. They either need to give up our own environment to properly manage or to learn to work closely together. They believe obscurity is security. All this does is put a black cloud of paranoia over all departments and causes major administrative overhead and time wasting."

276,2,Dull,Artist,Sony PlayStation project titles as portfolio,boring and dull task - soul crushing

Lots of great internal talks and KT sessions almost every week. Bi Annual Hackathons where interesting projects are made and productized. Some of these projects are already in the market.,"lot of Politics creeping in recently. - Hiring is rarely quality driven but more quantity driven. get a feeling managers are Not confident of brining in quality candidates so try to hire people without feeling entirely convinced - Growing Too quickly and now is unable to look after The Career paths of The employees. also leading to quantity based hiring. - unable to move out or motivate poor performers leading to bad team morale within The various teams - Tokyo is The boss which no one Can question. Tokyo teams try to take over work from US teams in an effort to get more work to Tokyo. - poor communication and coordination among teams. information is rarely shared among sites/groups since there is a huge fear of taking over projects by other teams. - Above all else, The Pay is much below market rate."

283,3,Not a review of SCEA as a whole. I predict that the boat is sinking at the First Party Quality Assurance department.,Contingent game test analyst,"I've never worked with a bunch of better people before. Fun and relaxed job. Of course, this is limited to my peers and my direct supervisors. I am extremely skillful and consistently win praises from them. Unfortunately, Senior Management doesn't know who I am. More on that in Cons.","Hours have been cut dramatically over the past year. I would have repeatedly returned due to overtime. I'm a person who does overtime for the success of the project and due to team loyalty, not necessarily money. But, due to changes by Senior Management that is gone and the quality of testing has suffered dramatically. Senior Management is comprised of friends and gaming buddies. If you're not their buddy, don't expect to get a permanent position and you don't necessarily have to be a good tester at that. There are a lot of lazy and useless permanent employees because of this. In a word: Politics. Temporary employees do not get any of the perks that a permanent employee do. This includes: Medical, paid time off, free games, food, and employee discounts."
284,5,engineer,Game developer,I love it so much,I can play and share my ideas anytime.

287,3,Some highs some lows,Senior software engineer,"1. Very stable, consistently increasing business for the last 8 years 2. Many opportunities to work on something interesting 3. Working with a lot of nice and intelligent people","1. So so health plan: both wife and ex have a better plan than mine 2. Whomever wrote about the Intuit mafia in another comment here is right. 16 people got hired from Intuit in the last 6 months, and, it seems mostly for management positions. 3. Newer management in question doesn't really understand our business, and doesn't listen to old timers. They often act like they understand and know more about the platform than us. 4. Newer management makes a lot of ill conceived decisions that are discouraging real talents, thus increasing loss of tribal knowledge."
288,4,YOU CAN BE,Product manager,We at Playstation admire the workplace of engineers and coders etc,Ideas for games and easy coding experience needed
289,5,Wonderful Company,Regional manager,One of the best brands in the business,Globalizing the US market took 2 years. This was very unsettling.
290,1,Good Company Benefits. Poor Team.,Anonymous employee,"Decent Company Benefits
Free Games
Free Swags
Discounted Sony Products","Very Poor Management
Constant Bullying from certain peers. Felt like High-School."
291,3,Leadership is incredible and Management is terrible,Anonymous employee,"The leadership is fantastic. You will be hard pressed to find more visionary, likable and intelligent leader in your department. They have a clear vision of the future of the company, the possibilities and it's incredibly contagious. They will give you a lot of vigor to fulfill their dreams so that the customer is well taken care of. They're also not afraid of taking their own risks and trying new things (as long as it meets their superiors agenda). As much as they will deny it at PlayStation, a love of gaming is near required. Which is a pro if you have a affinity for games. A con if you are not.","Management is incredibly powerful and they keep that power for themselves. The simple fact is that you were hired for a job, and for that job only. While some companies hire for creativity, intellectuality, boldness. You are at PlayStation to fill your cog in the machine. Giving me the feeling of being a Temp / Contractor more than a Full Time Employee. For example, exploring other aspects of PlayStation (let alone Sony) is near impossible due to the dozens of security, management protocols and other walled garden approaches that the company has taken in order to enforce this. However, the leadership within PlayStation or those who have their ears, will enjoy pushing the boundaries of entertainment while taking advantage of PlayStations bright and friendly workforce. In summary, if you're looking for a company ready to invest their dime in you to take risks or explore in any facet of the word without being in a position of power, then you best look elsewhere."
292,2,Process Heavy and Politics,Product manager,Cool brand - some teams are Fun - Cool initiatives in The pipeline,Process driven company where change is slow - Lack of diversity (in all ways possible) - Politics between teams makes It difficult for newcomers to ramp up - work is done in silo and difficult to track owners
293,4,Good but not fulfilling enough,Senior software engineer,"Good compensation and great benefits, the company makes tons of cash so it's being very generous on annual bonuses, it even has a cash-equivalent Employee Stock Program. Significant annual increases pretty much guaranteed if you're a decent enough achiever, so even if you start average it can climb pretty quickly. Great morale, it helps to work on an industry leading console which blows records month after month. Awesome to be able to show people your work on your PS4 at home. Nice people overall, very laid back atmosphere, lots of video games and Japan enthusiasts. Good diversity and very respectful atmosphere among employees (no brogrammers)","A lot of mediocrity among engineers: some of them barely knew how to program, others would spend more time on social media than working, or even some more interested in running their own interests before their assignments. If you end up locked up in one of these teams, it's very hard to get out. Also lots of politics going on, way too much for me. I was also not a big fan of the widespread SAFE methodology and the over-reliance on tools like Rally which created lots of overhead. Working with Japan is interesting but also very frustrating at times, especially as they have ownership of the platform. Finally, very limited remote work options, given that most of the work requires devkits that can't be accessed outside the office."
294,3,"San Mateo is great, San Diego...Not so much",Anonymous employee,"I have been with the Company for almost 10 years now, and I can say that the benefits and perks that come with the job are great. We get paid holidays and yearly bonuses as well. The passion that the employees have here is great, and there are tons of creative people you get to work with.","As the title mentions, the San Mateo location seems to be a totally different company than it's San Diego counterpart. The culture in SD has not changed for years, and often employees are bringing up the same issues year after year. I love the Company as a whole but things need to change. Moving up in the Company is difficult unless you know the right people, and the poor performers stay around for way too long."

If you are here in person on time, that is all it is about. Best for hourly workers and watch dogs. Measure your performance by timing, not results. Very strange culture for software industry. You have to come to daily stand ups in person only. Micromanager does not time themselves though. ""It"" can come late and leave early as ""it"" wishes. Because ""it"" makes rules only for you. ""It"" is above the rules ""it"" makes. ""It"" can cancel or reschedule meetings at the last minute without any heads up although requiring you to give 24 hours notice to change a meeting. Because ""it"" ""owns"" the team including you. You are just a slave. ""It"" does not need to do real work. ""Its"" job is ----- watching you!!!!!"

Your kids will be impressed. :-) New leadership is driving badly needed change, including a better focus on availability and a transition to a new architecture to support the next stage of growth. Management brought it from Intuit (and elsewhere) over the past couple of years are very good.",The organization is recovering from years of poor leadership that has left a bloated and inefficient organization. Many of the bad reviews you are seeing on Glassdoor are from a minority of disgruntled employees who are unwilling or unable to adapt to needed change. It is no longer acceptable to be paid just to come to work which is a good thing in my book!

310,2,"Fun atmosphere, but frequent layoffs",Anonymous employee,"There are a lot of great people and passionate gamers at PlayStation. There is also a lot going on and projects can change quickly, so if you thrive on rolling with the punches, you will be happy here. There is very little bench depth, so you also have to pull your own weight - but the people are willing to help and work a few extra hours so you can be successful.","Limited advancement opportunities and layoffs every 3-6 months. Employment is very unstable and management will not give you a heads up before you get a pink slip. In fact, we were told that no layoffs were being considered at a quarterly meeting by our SR. VP, yet 2 weeks later 50 positions were eliminated. Management is also pretty dishonest in general, and you can never get a feeling if the business is doing well or is in trouble. Finally, all the horror stories you hear about how people are ""let go"" in the gaming industry is very true at PlayStation - basically, your position was eliminated - give us your badge and get out."
311,3,"Good culture, not very competitive compensation",Senior brand manager,"Good culture, good people ad exciting products.",Does not have competitive salaries compared to other companies in the same area.
312,3,"Great place to be hired at, bad place to stay",Senior systems engineer,"Tons of openings, because all the long-timers are leaving; underpayment is the biggest single issue. Very competitive pay for new hires, which is the only way to get paid market rate here Excellent employee discounts Generally good benefits Very interested in diversity; diverse candidates should definitely apply - just don't stay long enough that your pay falls behind.","Zero effort to maintain current compensation for employees. Work/Life balance is a marketing blurb, not a commitment. They will tell you that you shouldn't work more than 8 hours a day and 5 days a week, and should use your vacation time, BUT will also hound you about maintaining deadlines which require 60+ hours a week to meet. Repeated statements that compensation will be brought current, but with NO follow through or broad correction, over a multiple year period. It's disingenuous at this point and the company is bleeding long-term talent because new-hire salaries are currently following market rates and going crazy, but no meaningful adjustment seems to be planned for existing employees. If you stay more than a few years, you'll see people hired in at your same job title making 10%-20% more money than you, just because the company does not value long term employees at all."
313,2,Don't be attracted by the name of the company.,Anonymous employee,"Less number of people, work is fun, not much pressure. Good for gamers or people who are ready to compromise ambition with leisure in their career. Few really good chaps work in there and its good to converse with them.","Do not expect anything in terms of growth if you are on a contract. Its peanuts. Process is not transparent. Feels like you are being mugged for your contribution tothe projects. Projects are scarce and learning is literally zero. The workplace does not contain the appeal and feel of a game testing lab and has more strict corporate feel to it. Canteen food is a real disappointment. Contracted employees are not made to be felt as a part of Sony, they are not involved in team outings. Ratio of contracted employee to permanent employee is 1:15 Dependent on other playstaion regional offices to get a project. No direct client interaction. You interact with a QA of other region who interacts with the developer, which results in non-transparent process and zero learning. Logistics are outdated and slow. Zero female employee, all males. The management does not take this department seriously and consider it just a time pass job."

315,5,Full Time SDE review,Software engineer,"After interning at two different offices over two years, I converted to full time. My time with Playstation Network has been good, both of my managers were cool in their own ways and the work was interesting. The San Diego office is more laid back and the San Francisco office is more like a standard hot tech company in the bay. Since I am going to be working fulltime in the bay I will give the Pros and cons of that office. Pros: - fun work environment, many avid gamers if you're into that kinda thing - Smart workers: all of the people I worked with knew what they were doing and were helpful, it's good to see that at a fairly new company. - Agile software development: The software development pace is quite quick which is great for rapid development and actually getting to see your changes in production. - The office is nice and in a good location to bart to. They are remodeling and adding some more entertainment like a new pool table.","some times The work environment Can be stressful, but that is to be expected when working on PS4 features affecting millions of users"

In relation with other companies I have worked in past (Cisco, GE Healthcare, Symantec) - At heart of this company its still stone aged in terms of technologies used inside (e.g. Lotus Notes - I hate it - trust me you will. , very mediocre intranet, no internal chat or IM, ) - No co-operation from sister concerns like SNE and others. A lot of politics in terms of who own the project/data rather then making a impact for benefit of greater Sony."

It's absolutely dysfunctional and close minded. Old school top down micro management style that closely watches you when you come in, when you go to lunch, when you leave, even when you go to the restroom sometimes. I'm not kidding. I had the worst manager ever in my career. Super low eq. Nobody likes to work with my manager. Rigid thinking. Unappreciative. Arrogant with I'm always right you are always wrong attitude while my manager only understands 20 year old methodology and technology. Things have changed lately, especially in the valley. Good luck with your so called gospel of truth thinking. You won't comprehend how laser works. Just stick with your stones. Super political. A lot of incompetent and skill set outdated people in house trying to stay employed while hiding their incompetencies. If you are forward thinking and naively think you can change these people and environment? Good luck with that. Human beings just can't survive during Jurassic period because the dinosaurs are too big and too strong to eat you up before you can even discover fire. If you are on the non operation side, I heard life is at least more ""normal."""
332,2,"Great employees, horrible management",Anonymous employee,"Most engineers are smart, dedicated and want to build great products. Some ""Silicon Valley"" type perks. Very casual environment where having an adult beverage is OK.","Management is ruining what used to be a great company. The new leadership from Intuit has killed morale and is forcing out the aforementioned smart employees. They are bringing in sub par former colleagues who were forced out of their previous company and buying ""Enterprise solutions"" instead of letting the engineers build great things. Do you like working a full day, then supporting midnight maintenances only to come in a few hours later for another full day of work? How about working Christmas day in the office? Good, because both are required. Non technical people leading and making the technical decisions? I'm confused. Every decision has become only about money, which I partially understand from a business perspective but it wears people out. Although management wasn't around for the development of the PS4 and the supporting services they like to take credit for how the company is doing."

I look forward to coming to work everyday and enjoy the people, the environment and the scope of work. I was not sure about working for a company that was owned by a Japanese company, but that is not an issue. Instead, it is such a huge benefit because we have the autonomy to work independently, yet all the benefits of the support and funding from such a huge corporation. Every work area has a gaming station and you are encouraged to play during work hours! How crazy fun is that! Plus, having the opportunity to work so closely with the executive team, I am able to see clearly our mission and why what we do is important. Passionate people, phenomenal products and great benefits! Also, pay is great and the bonus program is killer, not to mentions the perks like deep discounts on ALL Sony products, matching 401K, generous medical and dental and the PTO and paid holidays makes it easy for work / life balance.","No real cons other than the commute is long -- but given the amenities, the gym opens at 6am, so you can come in early and workout and beat traffic and the coffee bar and cafe open at 7:30am - so everything you need!"

352,2,Uninspiring place to work where mediocrity is tolerated and excellence is discouraged,Senior software engineer,"The perks are nice. The work environment is extremely lax. Expectations are low and there is little accountability. Middle management is mostly clueless so it's very easy to slack off during the work day. You will never get fired. If you are writing a comedy series or a comic strip about indifferent workers and clueless managers, this job could be an excellent source of material.","It is an extremely political environment driven by insecurity and paranoia. If you can tolerate being in the right clique, you will do okay. You will also do okay if you are indifferent about work and are just there to collect a pay check. It is not the place to be if you are a high-achiever. You will be seen as a threat by middle management, lose what little autonomy and decision-making power you had, and get criticized when your less-capable peers complain about you refusing to do their jobs for them. Most of the high-achievers have already left so what remains are lazy ""lifers"" and the naive who do not know any better (do a search on the ""dead sea effect"")."

Lots of good management who are genuinely passionate about the business, have input in setting their own inspired goals, and are not just trying to meet quotas handed to them from above. Headquarters was recently moved to USA, making one of the cons that almost everyone mentions here a little less con-ish.","Working with the parent company in Japan can be frustrating (but maybe less-so moving forward). It's an older company with an established management hierarchy, so don't expect to join on the ground floor and then be able to move up the ladder quickly. The food court in the Foster City isn't especially good or cheap."

Cool discounts on PlayStation and SONY products.,"Depends on departments, but if someone ends up in a department where managers and majority of the workforce are in another country then US counterparts are seen with disdain and with open racism. No matter how talented you are, your contribution will never be credited as foreign and openly racist managers hate you. Career path is non existent and managers want to stick to old tech/tools/designs as much as possible. Anybody happy with using same tool/tech for several years with no aim for new thought but can run an operation day to day is rewarded more than anyone with newer and more practical experience. At company level the compensation is at the bottom tier compared to other similar SF Bay Area companies. No RSU/ stock based compensation or no effort to balance that with higher bonus."

The more people you know, the more you understand the way the company works and it's many components, the more successes you will encounter. This is not a company for somebody who needs to be nursemaided 24/7, or who is devoted to formal processes. If you possess talents, are good with people, take the initiative, and possess some measure of patience you can go very far.","It's not for everyone. Successful employees tend to put a lot of effort into decoding the large and complex org. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone who wasn't open to putting in at least two years of service before passing judgement - this place takes time, but the benefits can be worth the wait.

In less than a year, I watched 70% of my team leave. 2 top executives quit outright (giving no notice), leaving their positions unfilled until a year plus after. New middle and senior management has little to no experience in the space. The culture is becoming increasingly conservative, cliquey and less diverse as the parent company struggles financially. Said passionate and skilled workers were burned through, weren't recognized for their efforts, and left. Successful or innovative work is considered threatening and not rewarded. Not-rocking-the-boat is encouraged. Remaining and new employees are necessarily apathetic and mediocre in order to survive. Zero career growth paths. Strategy is often abandoned and teams are randomized due to pet projects and poor operational planning. Groundhog Day."

He attempted to relate and engage with you on a personable level and provide flexibility, support, and discretion for how you chose to pursue objectives, as well as feedback and resources for personal learning and development and encouragement to learn about different areas and departments of the company that might be of interest to you.","I did not feel there was a downside to working for the company itself. I had ample opportunity to learn the material and concepts that I was interested in even though they weren't directly part of my core tasks, as well as the opportunity to meet and learn from other industry workers who lent their experience and willingness to answer questions about the industry. The only issue that could have been improved was the occasional confusion over reporting of work hours as an intern, partly because they prefer you not to log hours overtime, and because new hire orientations can happen months to over a year after your start date."

The new management is passionate about making sure the customer experience is everything they expect, and are driving real change to overcome some past problems. There are a lot of perks working for Sony, including great benefits, movie premiers, hackathons, game tournaments, off-site team-building events, and discounts on products. Sony also has a great diversity program that's very friendly to women.","Any time you drive change, there are going to be some growing pains.

Rancho Bernardo office culture is Siloed and Stifling. Yes, the salary was good but it really wasn't about the money. I felt stuck and stifled. I had already been there for 3 years and I could no longer handle the obscurity of its culture, lack of direction and transparency. The workload was too high and the pressure was constant. Additionally, having a manager constantly breathing down your neck was disheartening. C-Level leadership based in this office lacks vision and strategy, as well as the fortitude and insight to do what's necessary to generate process improvement and forward momentum.

Yes, we are all locked in a room together to collaborate...feels like electing a pope where no one is getting out until we are done...only we have food, snacks, and breaks. They listen and make changes to improve our overall culture. Culture is pretty laid back. Facility is amazing. Benefits are improving. Great holiday parties.","No defined career paths for employees.

Mediocre VPs with no experience bring in directors of engineering who have never been an engineer just does not make any sense. It's hard to respect directors who acts with a brute force without even understanding the perspective of others. They completely threw away everything we have been working so hard on and come into the company demanding to rebuild everything for the sake of rebuilding. The moral is really low in the company and it kills any innovation because we have no freedom to innovate.
372,3,"They care for customers, not so sure about employees",Technical project manager,"Hands on with gaming consoles and games. The company strives hard to keep customers/gamers happy by keeping content fresh and introducing new technologies. Lots of talented and passionate employees work here. The ""cool"" factor about working at a gaming company, your family & friends flock towards you at parties/gatherings.","The gaming community as a whole are very spoiled customers compared to other industries. They get to whine and complain about the smallest details about games and consoles that will cause the Nintendos/Microsofts/Sonys to have knee-jerking reactions to their strategies and decisions. This often comes at a price of causing stress to employees in forms of constant team restructuring, projects being in constant flux, management changing directions, layoffs and OFFICE POLITICS. If you can't handle being thrown under the bus or not being sure whether people are talking $h!t behind your back, don't work here or at any gaming company!"
373,1,Not Bitter Just SAD,Character artist,Worked on many KICKASS games with some awesome people.,"Worked for the company as a ""Contract"" employee for 8 years. To get around the laws of California they would ""lay me off"" for a few months then have me back so they didn't have to pay for my benefits. I loved what I did but management refused to give reviews, pay raises or hire me on full-time even though the position was available and I had received a Masters Degree in the same field. That all isn't the worst. The worst was after 8 years they ""ghosted"" me. Basically, they told me they were going to lay me off for a few months, then when I contacted them repeatedly for when my start date was...NO RESPONSE. I thought these people were my friends ...The biggest slap in the face was my job was posted on their website 3 weeks later. ....Thanks Sony San Diego!"
374,5,"Great gamer culture, great growth opportunities, some shortcomings",Product manager,"Great educational, medical and transportation perks - Great bonuses and employee discounts on PlayStation and Sony products - lots of opportunities to travel overseas, particularly to Tokyo or London - Supportive leadership that Lets employees explore different Career paths and grow - Passionate coworkers who love gaming and are really into what they are doing - a low-conflict environment with a Strong drive for consensus and respect - Agile development practices with continuous improvement, hackathons and quick adjustments based on lessons learned - work from home opportunities in The U.S. and management focused on Results, Not attendance - a quirky and creative environment typical of The gaming industry - a company that encourages playing games at work - a very approachable CEO and most other top leaders - lots of women in leadership positions, even in Japan (mostly up to Sr. Director level but also some VPs)","- Incompetence is sometimes tolerated indefinitely, true to the life-employment model of Japan - Managers frequently lack the most fundamental people management skills and don't know how to motivate their employees - Lack of open conflict leads to a lot of back-channeling, politics and having to read between the lines - In the Tokyo office, expectations about work hours are insane and no one can work from home, which leads to female workers still largely being forced to choose between having career success and being single, or having a decent but unimpressive job at PlayStation and having a family - The super-Agile style of the San Fransisco office frequently clashes with the Waterfall thinking of Tokyo - As of 2018, analytics is still not a big part of decision making and a lot of product managers are weak - Employee performance management is unpredictable and convoluted. There are no company-wide OKRs and it's hard to understand how performance goals are measured"
375,2,"Sometimes fun, but often a let down",Anonymous employee,"So many of the people are incredible and the products are really fun. The games, the people, the culture of play could make it into a terrific place to work... But","There's massive chaos right now on what the company will become. They've had three new CEOs in 18 months, and their Network still lags behind the competition. Overall, the company is in major upheaval, which is surprising and often creates some major confusion about where one fits. Companywide functions are really underpowered -- some are barely even paid attention to while others dominate. So often, stuff happens with in one function in a complete silo, and then it breaks across other groups."
376,3,Volatile environment with no respect for employees,Anonymous employee,"There are some very talented people at SNEI in San Diego who work hard to achieve results, believing in doing the right things. The business has challenging goals to achieve and they will likely succeed with proper attention to delivering experiences to beat their competitors. Salary is good and the onsite gym is great. Culture there is fast-paced but allows for company outings to get to know your colleague and just to have a good time.","The business is volatile and can be crushed easily by their competitors if not done correctly. The turn-over is high and I've seen people let go immediately with no notice and there's a hush-hush attitude about it. Work environment is fierce so you have to be careful whom you may disappoint or else management will easily let you go, I've seen it with my own eyes."
377,5,Wonderful place to work!,Anonymous employee,"SNEI is a great place to work. This division of Sony only started about 6-8 years ago, as opposed to SCEA which has been around a while. Anyway, because its new, you feel like it almost has a start-up feel to it even though its such a well-established company! People really care about your growth here, they want to hear your opinion and your input, and they are very smart people! They're also super down to earth. The quality of work is amazing you get to work on an entertainment platform - games, movies and music!! I definitely give it the highest rating!","There are always some negatives to a job (certain employees, processes' etc) but its all what you make of it. Its like taking the bad with the good, but generally I see everything is pretty great at this place"
378,4,Good place to work for but effective management is a bit lacking.,Anonymous employee,Working at PlayStation is pretty fun if you love video games. The work environment is laid-back in general. The company is not a stickler for when you get in or leave. People are pretty understanding if you need to leave early for personal reasons or need to take a few days off for vacation. The employees are nice and it's relatively easy to become close to the people you work with.,"In the time I've worked here, I've come to realize the company is not as organized as you hope it would be for such a big corporation. Communication is lacking and sometimes things aren't done effectively or on time because of this. I think this partly has to do with how many people are involved in one project. With so many people, there is a tendency for projects to lose focus because there is not one person or group taking ownership."
379,3,Lots of weekends!,Merchandising field representative,Anything that PlayStation makes you get for free! Very generous PTO policy. Company is closed between Christmas and New Years with pay. Cool products and great brand recognition. Merchandisers get to make their own schedule with some parameters.,Being a merchandiser used to be a fun job. You got to meet different people and every day was different. But now all we do is go to the same store every weekend and demo VR. My work life balance has gotten really bad. I work almost every weekend and I often work 8 days in a row or more because I am still expected to perform my normal duties along with the weekend work. I am getting burnt out.
380,1,"Good People, Terrible Management",Senior software engineer,large-scale - really Great engineers - Weekly lunches - benefits,"- 25% of the advertised compensation was a yearly bonus. Don't be fooled. Depending on when you join it might be 1.5 years before you get it. - Also, if they decide you are not worth what they're paying, which base salary is already below average, they will string you along until just before bonus time and cut you with 0 days warning. - Also, and this is a first that I've ever heard of in the Bay Area, no severance whatsoever. Yes, none at all. Nothing. No 2 weeks pay, no warning, no here's rent money until you find something. Just, don't show up any more. - They work you like a start up but you have none of the creative input. - Management is incompetent and out of touch with the technologies and decisions. - Politics. A friend who spearheaded a major initiative to change the entire server deployment process, working day and night, did not get a promotion while the manager is taking all the credit."
381,2,"Used to be great, recently lost its way",Anonymous employee,"- The individual contributors are very good. They're smart, driven, and very easy-going. - The benefits and perks as part of the Sony family are great: Good health plans, huge discounts on sony products, free playstation games, etc. - Workers are encouraged to develop their skills by learning new tech and attending training and seminars. - Work / life balance is great. People are given flexibility as long as the work gets done. - Office culture is relaxed and casual.","with one or two exceptions, middle management is Toxic, tribal, and self-serving. - Zero opportunity to move up in your Career - Pending merger with SIE is causing dread and rumors about job security, made worse by silence from Upper management. - office space is outdated and falling apart, management has no plans to do anything about it."
382,3,Used to be a good place to work.,Anonymous employee,"The people were good. Discount on Sony products. Occasional in-house happy hours. Ability to watch some movies pre-release. Without question, the company brand name was good.","Once the Sr Mgmt crew (all formerly from another well known company in the area) came in and took over things started to go downhill. The company used to support Scrum but started doing things that seemed to be very contrary to agile practices. The attitudes of the new ""leadership"" was very negative, at least towards existing SNE employees. They were better with the ones they brought in from their former company. This caused many to feel they were being adversarial."
383,1,Awful company with fake people,Operations analyst,Free games and that's it,"Everything, payment , management, work hours , yoh"
384,2,Independent place that lacks direction and vision,Anonymous employee,"Informal atmosphere, good benefits, good time off. People can be very friendly.","The company feels like it lacks direction. A great deal of bureaucracy strangles innovation. Company feels like it's loosing it's competitive edge in the age of online gaming. HR is a nightmare. No solid plan for advancement within the company. Company doesn't mentor. HR has no strategy in place to retain top talent. Pay is low. Talent is mediocre. Japanese style hierarchy and decision making structure is out of place in Silicon Valley. The company ""events"" have become an embarrassing joke (karaoke in the parking lot anyone?)."
385,1,Intuit Mafia is ruining SNEI,Anonymous employee,Sony has a good work/life balance. SNEI revenue is growing rapidly and should continue to do so for at least the next year or two. Most people working there who are not former Intuit employees are good people to work with.,"Over the last year a new executive in the San Diego office has been aggressively clearing out people and installing yes-people from Intuit. We're not just talking about clearing out people that perhaps needed to go, but clearing out anyone that asks questions. The entire atmosphere of innovation, collaboration, and desire to produce the best result for the company has been replaced with one that punishes innovation and enforces conformity and acquiescence over all else."
386,1,It's all a ploy for cheap labor,Intern,"Having PlayStation on your resume is cool, telling your friends about it is cool, and the free swag is cool.","Don't expect to be valued as an actual part of your team. I was often left with no projects and when I asked for more, my peers and manager would tell me they were busy and I couldn't help them. There was a lot of politics even from an intern level. Although the dress code is laid back, the culture in general is not. I saw many team members staying late to meet deadlines and could feel the stress in the air. Sony will tear you apart and does not value their employees. It also sucks because they offer a lot of contract roles and you never know what your status may be with that. Very little information was offered to me in my performance review and I was never told how I could improve or what could have gone better."
387,2,Toxic,Anonymous employee,"Working on PlayStation and being a part of the video game industry. The PlayStation ecosystem is always on the cutting edge, and the time I spent there was during the PS4 launch so it was doubly exciting. The passion and enthusiasm many of the employees have for what they're doing is unrivaled. It wasn't uncommon to find people who just loved what they did.","Management was terrible. The value of human resources was lost on many people, and the people in positions of power were too interested in saving face to make sure their workforce was being managed and treated properly. There were countless situations where management was aware of a terrible work environment but actively avoided the subject and did nothing to rectify the situation."
388,3,Good place to learn,Senior engineer,"Good place to learn, gain experience and make connections. The London office is in central London with a lot to do nearby, great restaurants and culture. You work for Playstation which people are generally know and interested about. You work with game studios and technologies that will be used in future games and media. The culture is inclusive, you will find many different looking faces here. There was no crunch and a pretty good work-life balance in my team.","Lot of company politics to deal with, secrecy and distrust between different teams. Lots of emails on the start of day and multiple meetings per day that are unproductive. Collaboration between different regions is sparse. Some internal systems that are being used are ancient. Salary is a joke, people working at Playstation are often living in house shares in London, and you will not be able to save up on an Engineer salary."
389,3,average company,Business operations manager,"I worked as Department Operations Manager. Average employee experience compared to other companies in the Bay area. HR people are nice and receptive but a mouthpiece for the Sr Directors and VPs- forget employee advocation! Nice HQ, good holiday parties. Good learning module on employee central. Legal people are also very collaborative and friendly. Good Pay and bonus.","Facilities workers are efficient but the managers are totally narcissistic. R&D department is run like a concentration camp. Have no idea how to efficiently manage people. Slave drivers rather than inspiring team to engage. Very Very hierarchical, political charged culture, employees with Japanese background are favored and not reprimanded- high level of Nepotism. Not at all entrepreneurial. Employees not promoted based on merit, but based on their national origin (or who they know)."
390,4,SCEA sucks,Anonymous employee,"Benefits, culture, free food and drinks, parties, my management is awesome (YMMV), opportunity to explore different things, some work from home, flexible hours, tons of paid time off.","Perks like holiday parties are declining, upper management cuts money on necessary small return items and spends liberally on unnecessary stuff; high turnover and onboarding of every single application anyone wants creates a lot of work and hemorrhages money, but they cut spending on office cleaning and other minor expenses. Merging of SCEA and SNEI has been appallingly inept and there has been little or no engagement of stakeholders for anything."
391,2,"Formerly a good workplace, now going down hill.",Anonymous employee,Discounts on the limited selection of first party games.,Pay isn't great when they're trying to compete and act like a tech company. Benefits are mediocre and don't compare to other companies in the area. Big distinction in work place benefits compared to their first party studios. No employee development or major support towards paying for education. Educational support is on the low end.
392,5,Best Place I've Worked to Date,Information security engineer,Sony Interactive Entertainment evolves and changes to improve not only innovations to become more profitable but I really feel like they care about their employees. They continue to improve processes and policies if they aren't successful. Fantastic benefits package Emphasis on work/life balance Great coworkers - lots to learn from others There is a sense of community to solving problems (lots of support from others) Wonderful company goals that are actually strived for,"At least in my department, meaningful self improvement training budget has been cut which is a bummer. As in many places, opportunities for advancement are limited but there is a balance to be met here between becoming too management heavy but I think SIE does a fair job of figuring that out. I really respect the executive team and believe they have a good vision for the company, however there are some middle managers that tend to play politics instead of focusing on improvements."
393,2,"Company with good perks, but the system is suffering from a lot of growing pains",Brand manager,Good perks if you are a gamer. Benefits package is alright. The company is an industry giant and has market leadership.,"The system is so entrenched in a kind of boys club attitude. Time spent in the company, deference to leaders, and maintaining the status quo are the main concerns. You will be thrown out if you do not move with the grain or if you question how things are done or try to think outside of the box. The way they treat contractors is embarrassing. Pay is much lower than a good majority of the Bay Area companies. The benefits package is alright, but there are no stock options. The company is still smarting from globalization and if you are on a global team, you can pretty much kiss your work-life balance goodbye."
394,1,Don't apply if you want to progress,Functional tester,Games given out to staff on launch date for free. Occasional raffle for freebies. Cake table at end of the month.,"Unless you're in a certain circle of people don't expect to get an interview for a promotion, even if you've worked hard at the company for years. People are promoted based on favouritism and not experience/skills which leads to some staff lacking in skills to manage a team. Certain seniors abuse their position and treat testers like children, some going so far as to bully staff and get them into trouble. If a person is favourited they can get away with pretty much anything, even if a higher up witnesses them doing something bad. Test floor gets super toxic whenever a new position gets announced and some staff don't hold back on saying what they think of others capabilities."
395,2,Sr. Designer,Senior designer,"Very nice campus. Good benefits. Nice cafeteria. Some fun perks like monthly $10 game vouchers and discounts on hardware. A week and a half shut down during the holidays which is good for full-time employees, but not contractors (which don't get paid).",Some inexperienced employees waste multiple team's time and energy by being reactive and flip-flop in their decision making. This wastes time and energy for multiple teams and is frustrating to be effected by inexperienced employees with too much power. Pay is below market rate and hours are inflexible (9am-6pm).
396,4,Cut your teeth,Cinematic animator,"Projects, people and location. You will be able to apply to a huge selection of studios if you spend a few years here.","Contract oriented, static pay, no upward mobility or broad knowledge learned. If you want to focus on the core of being a cinematic animator, you do that here. Get in some beach time while you are at it because you may not want to wait five years to move up the ladder or get a raise. It is a well known fact in the studio that you have to leave and come back to get a meaningful raise, and you might find yourself priced out of the studio with how competitive the rest of the industry is now."
397,2,Not a place for ambitious people,Engineer,"* Amazing product (PlayStation!!!) * If lucky, you get to work on very visible parts of the products * Get to try pretty cool games or tech (Morpheus) * Nice campus","* Work/life balance can be poor - a few people do all the work - others do the minimum * Don't even think about being a contractor there: you will be treated like garbage * All key decisions are made in Japan, no involvement of US people in the decisions * Impossible to have a relevant role or any ambition - dead end for your career * Low compensation compared to the rest of Silicon Valley * Management aware of all these problems - not doing anything about it."
398,5,work hard....have fun,Anonymous employee,"The culture here is pioneering. Not quite a startup anymore, rather an organization striving to grow. Not for everyone. People who excel here are ingenious, see around corners, have an “anything is possible” outlook, live for the mission, are cool to work with, possess tons of resilience and are really top in their craft. Personally, have a great boss, great team and super cool work to do. It's not by any stretch an easy job - but it's one where I make a difference every day and have fun doing it.",The org is behind in building out infrastructure and systems. Organizations have a lot of autonomy - but it also results in silos.
399,2,"Major Issues - Too Many 'Lifers', and Not Open to Change!",Anonymous employee,Decent benefits package Ok work/life balance Relative Flexible Schedule,- Employees that have been there a long time no longer have to prove themselves. Too many old fat cats. - New employees are held to a different standard. - There are double standard and unfairness in how employees are treated. Too many old 'cliques'. Somewhat like high school. - Communication from ANY management level is sorely missing. - Change is at a snail's pace.
400,3,Enjoyable at times yet taxing almost always,Anonymous employee,- I get to work with a product I've grown up with and love. - I get to work with some of the coolest people I've ever gotten to know. - The team you get really starts to become family after a while.,"- Favoritism is a huge issue here and the only ones promoted are those on the inside, not the qualified. - Management doesn't really disclose things that are pertinent to our job ahead of when we'll need the information. - We're often left blindsided by some of the issues that happen and our stats are used against us even if it's a new issue that we don't know how to resolve. - The turnover rate here is pretty high and good agents leave due to management's lack of transparency/flexibility or other stupid reasons."
401,5,Great place to work with exciting products touching millions of users,Senior manager - product management,"Once in Sony, you will have a hard time leaving, it is hard to beat when the products and services you are in charge of affects millions of people around the globe. Lot of opportunities to grow and at the same time enhance exciting products and services. Great and smart people. International culture and opportunities for working abroad.","Being part of a huge organization often also unfortunately mean slower in many aspects as there are more stakeholders and customers to consider and keep happy, which can be frustrating. Large old solutions that takes a lot of time to change and keep up to the changing market."
402,4,Very nice company with dedicated enthusiastic employees,Anonymous employee,"Company culture overall is great. All employees want to or think they are doing the right thing, very few really bad apples (tho some incompetence). People really are company's strongest asset. And of course PS4 is such a great product to be associated with. Business is booming and lots of excitement over new SIE formation.","Some employees need more guidance than they're getting. Still seems like poor performance (behaviours that are self-promoting rather than for the good of the business) is not sufficiently counseled to stop. Lots of valuable time wasted this way. Also, poor performers need to have good workers cover their poor performance, further setting the company behind."
403,3,A great industry somewhat undone by over-reliance (and staffing) at the senior management level,Finance,"Sony is a company with a rich brand history and this makes for an interesting work environment. The video game industry is still in growth mode, which creates an environment where contributions can be made at all levels (of course, provided that management allows for such contributions to be made). Entertainment is a integral part of people's lives and working for a company that develops entertainment product puts one ""front an center"" in this part of lifestyles. Benefits are reasonably good at Sony and the fact that many video game companies, including Sony Computer Entertainment America, are closed over the Christmas holidays is a nice perk.","Room for advancement is limited, particularly in certain functional areas. Japanese run leads to some complications when trying to address US or European markets."
404,4,Great company on the cusp of being Excellent,Anonymous employee,"The products we work on are amazing, innovating, and inspiring The benefits are great Lots of vacation time to decompress from working hard Having all the technology available to complete your work Management encourages initiative and responsibility, you're not just a cog","Growth opportunities can seem slower, not provided, or not communicated how to achieve. Sometimes someone from outside takes a position in which an internal promotion would have been a better fit. Trickle down of information lacking. There are lots of innovative, exciting things happening and new directions SNEI is moving, but this information sometimes doesn't trickle down. Try to bring those high level meetings back down to the employees."
405,4,Great benefits and salary,Anonymous,"The benefits and stability here are great, especially for a company in this field. And, this is from someone who was laid off. They are also one of the top game companies, when it comes to paying their full time employees a good salary.","Although their salaries are great, the raises aren't, even with top yearly review scores. Over the course of 6-7 years, I received a total 9% raise. The actual salary was still better than all other places, but in a better market, I probably would have looked elsewhere. #2 absolutely no career advancement opportunity. Everyone is pretty much locked in place."
406,4,Fun and challenging company with a bit of an addiction to managers.,Anonymous employee,"- Very laid back environment - Challenging work - Small, fast-moving teams - Get to work with and develop some extremely cool tech - Since being acquired by Sony, work hours have been reduced to ""normal"". - Lots of company sponsored events for the employees.","- Company is a bit ""top heavy"". It feels like every new person who gets hired is a manager or a manager or managers. Most of which, I am not even really sure what they do on a day to day. - The release process is a bit painful, but it is improving."
407,5,Good Company with a little too much management,Programmer,"- Incredible people (intelligent and creative) to work with - Amazing work/life balance. The occasional worked weekend is sometimes given back in lieue (worked two weekends in 5 years - one was returned). - Generally cool with semi flexible hours. 8:30-5, 9:30-6 or anything in between.","some of The projects have a lot of management, and its Not really obvious what all of them do. - Legal is a joke. they do Not actively know what The requirements are for a lot of games, but tend to simply require The harshest restrictions possible. Advice: never suggest anything to legal. get them to return specific requirements."
408,4,"Fast, fun and exciting place to be. Working on the cutting edge and possibly changing an industry.",Anonymous employee,Everyone is great to work with. Most people are smart and hard working. Plenty of team building events throughout the year. Lots of little perks.,They will work you to the bone day in day out. Expected to work long hours. There is no real structure to projects. Most of the management have unrealistic time tables. Difficult to move up in the company. A bit understaffed. On the lower pay scale for this type of company. No appreciation of the hard work accomplished when going above and beyond the call of duty.
409,2,A place to kill your time but not to develop your career future,Software engineer,flexible working hours; every year there is a holiday shutdown between Christmas and New Years day... that's the only pros I can think of...,"too many/frequent changes at management level, senior managers/directors come and go, the working experience in the same company is not recognized by itself, incapable mid-senior management team, almost the entire DB department is called Indian team which implies its recruitment might not be a fair play, too many politics at all levels, you have career future here only if your manager likes you personally, work performance has nothing to do with it...salaries of same level engineers from different groups can be a huge difference...over the long term it's a sinking ship..."
410,3,good place to get a big name on your resume,Anonymous employee,"Friendly work environment Great company perks like happy hours, company events, holidays, etc. Great brand with a lot of pride in the work, work is extremely interesting and fun Company is doing well as a whole",Do not contract here - they treat contractors differently than they do FTE. There are no guarantees you will be hired once your contract is up Very political culture as is every big company - hard to move up in the company if you do not have the right 'relationships' Management only looks at success based on team as a whole - does not look at specific individuals (aka there are a lot of terrible managers that slip through loopholes)
411,3,Lucky that games are selling so well,Software engineer,"Good salaries, benefits, work/life balance. Exciting technical problems to be solved. Engineers work well together and have respect for each other.","You know if the company has to pay for a featured review to refute the other bad reviews and blame existing problems on past management (even though new management has been around for over two years) then there is probably a problem. Almost all middle level development managers (who have been there more than a few years) have left (or fired) because of contention with upper management. Development direction is based on good principals, but lacking in details and leadership."
412,3,"Great co-workers, zero career advancement",Marketing,"- The people at PlayStation are passionate about the products we're assigned to, and its apparent in our work. We are pushed hard to accomplish a lot with little time. - There are many resources from within the company to manifest outward facing communication. - on-site gym and cafeteria.","we work so fast, that we forget about our own careers... and HR does Not seem to care. our goals for The fiscal year are written within The last two month of The year, rendering them meaningless. - Prerequisites for promotion are vague. when a straight answer is obtained from management, The Prerequisites change by The end of The year, making promotion impossible to achieve. some employees stay in The same position for a decade (or more) before promotion."
413,2,Crummy work environment - lack of inovation,Software engineer,Some of the coworkers are really great friends and companions and fun to be around. Great for people without experience to get a head start and move up in a corporate environment.,"Terrible work life balance, 40 hours a week is considered not enough by management, which as a programmer is pretty bad. Worked for months until 8 or 9 o'clock at night plus some weekends and was still reprimanded for not working 'hard enough'. Management would intentionally steer away from new technology and favor the old just to get products out faster. Constant unrealistic deadlines set by inexperienced managers who have no knowledge of software development themselves."
414,4,"Great opportunities to learn, grow, and keep healthy W/L balance!",Engineer,"Always exposed to new and interesting topics. Plenty of opportunities to grow and learn. And the work-life balance seems very healthy overall, with a few exceptions.","Although they've made a lot of progress in recent years, there really needs to be more coordination, communication, and better organization between all the many parts of Sony. It is very challenging to work with all the different parts of the company scattered all over the world. On the other hand, it certainly makes for plenty of fun work-related travel. This company definitely has the resources to make great things happen, but still lacks the coordination among all its disparate parts."
415,5,PlayStation Europe (London HQ) Great people and culture to work for,Group marketing manager,"Dynamic and exiting working culture which doesn't overwhelm or stress employees with tight and unreliable deadlines but it encourages creativity and innovation. Also it has recently started to substantially improve how PlayStation look after its employees with initiatives such as flexible working, new facilities including a gym, or session well-being related. People there are amazing and its a classic to pop down to the canteen on Thursdays or Fridays after work to have a drink and have a laugh with your colleagues.","Rather than a con it's more a challenge the company has come across due to its impressive and fast growth over the past years, specially since PS4 launch, which has made that the company structure and some behavioural process are still catching up with that fast growth."
416,4,I enjoyed 6 of my 7 years,Anonymous employee,"Decent workspaces, new computer every couple of years, flexible hours, on-site health club and cafe, most of the employees are smart and motivated to make the best product possible.",The recent management shakeup has been driving people out of the company by telling them that everything they've done for the last 7 years is crap and it all needs to be redone. Not the way to inspire loyalty.
417,2,"Leadeship heavy, powerless engineers",Senior software engineer,Pay is OK - bonus is Above average - socials and PlayStation consoles available if you find time to play,"leadership heavy, powerless managers of all kinds for a single project - department Director gets The final say on every Small decision - be prepared to work late shifts and holidays supporting production even for SW Engineering positions - people being hired (previous coworkers) without proper interview and causing lots of issues - Horrible HR tools"
418,2,"SNEIntuit ""Leadership"" is Proof of ""Be Careful What You Wish For""",Software engineering,"The overall PlayStation product line and offerings are something the employees are proud of. The engineers and the line managers are hard working and competent. The grassroots attempts of perks and innovation programs are cool. Just not fully supported by upper management. Job security and overall company performance is positive. As is the work/life balance flexibility. There are times when we need to work off hours and off holidays, but the flexibility of daily activities makes up for it.","2 years ago, there was a leadership void in San Diego. The solution was transplanting Intuit employees up a ladder rung across the board atop SNEI employees. However, the leadership above line managers are not new leaders, but simply new managers. All Intuit employees coming to SNEI for promotions in your career beware, your ""contributions"" are not completely welcomed. Simply assuming you know best without asking questions or listening to feedback is an ignorant approach to management. Force feeding architecture and projects and getting acquiescence is not a sign of agreement but simply a sign of fear and sense of hopelessness. There is no trust. Some of the new regime are decent human beings, but others are simply egotistical, arrogant, micromanaging, over their heads, inexperienced, and disconnected from human interactions outside their circle of trust. All of this goes without saying that career movement opportunities is non-existent unless you break into the circle of trust."
419,2,"Great Brand, Great People, Poor Management",Anonymous employee,One of the coolest brands in the world and amazing products with a healthy financial outlook. Great people and working culture in EU.,"Middle Aged White Men's club. A lot of management have been there more than 10 years and lacking diversity in both management style and ideas. How well you get on with your seniors more important than your output. Literally no performance management, have many examples of people coasting for years doing nothing. Trying to be a global company but nowhere near in terms of organising themselves wasting loads of resources and time. IT services in Europe stuck in 90s (example migrated from Lotus Notes to Outlook only 3 years ago!)"
420,2,Burnout Culture and Bad for Women,Anonymous employee,"PlayStation is a great place to work for anyone who wants to make a serious career in the gaming industry. Having PlayStation on your resume opens a lot of doors. You should also consider PlayStation if you prefer an indirect conflict resolution style because the company culture discourages open confrontation and disagreement. A lot of alignment is done through back channels. Lastly, PlayStation is a good place for anyone interested in the Japanese language or culture. Japanese is used for product development discussions on a daily basis and the corporate culture is similar to what you see at big corporations in Tokyo. There are also frequent business trips to Japan (outside of the COVID pandemic).","- Burnout Culture At PlayStation, you'll have unnecessary meetings until 8 or 9 pm three or more times a week, without anyone asking if you have small children, or what exactly your children are doing while you are stuck in unplanned video conferences. None of these meetings are useful or necessary. Most of them never even needed to be an email. They are tedious status updates that go on for 2 hours and suck the spirit out of everyone. 10 or 14-hour work days are common, and no one knows why or what for. Nothing is automated, everything is in Google sheets or 60 Slack channels. Everything is always on fire and not being available is unacceptable. Vacations don't belong to you either, and your manager will pull you into meetings during vacation time too. PlayStation seems to have imported the concept of ""karoshi"" (death from overwork"") from Tokyo into Silicon Valley. - Terrible for Women As a woman at PlayStation, please prepare yourself to have supbar maternity benefits, the least desirable projects and performance reviews filled with gender-biased language. All of the most important product development always goes to the bro-culture dudes and there is a general lack of opportunity for women. Men always talk over women in meetings and no one ever stops them. Men also attack women when they are not available for meetings due to childcare conflicts or during no-meeting hours. PlayStation isn't at all interested in supporting mothers. That said, to create an appearance of caring for womens' issues, PlayStation has a number token womens' initiatives, except they are run by men and do exactly nothing to empower PlayStation women. During the COVID pandemic, PlayStation women were hit especially hard. Managers asked mothers to take paid vacation days to support their kids' virtual school. The CEO was extremely tone-deaf and kept sending messages about his sports interests and his barbeque parties as PlayStation women came together to cry because the loss of childcare was ruining their lives and their company didn't care. A lot of the company gender discrimination seems to be based on covert patterns of gaslighting. Not promoted or empowered? It's because you are incompetent, not because you are a woman (never mind statistical data). The company has consistently refused to release gender-based pay data. If you are a woman, just say no to this company. - Horrifyingly Bad People Managers. If you haven't had your share of bullying, yelling, humiliation and continuous put-downs, PlayStation is the company for you. Old-time individual contributors get promoted to people managers and then there is no one to keep their abusive behavior in check. If you are unhappy, please prepare yourself to accept a severance package because HR will never believe you or take you seriously. - Biggest and worst of all, PlayStation leadership is incompetent and runs the company on their gut alone, while serious players come into the gaming space with analytics and data-driven insights. PlayStation is stuck in trusting its long-time ""bros"" and their gut feelings. PlayStation will go the way of Blackberry unless it wakes up."
421,2,Good people - bad senior management,Anonymous employee,People are nice and helpful. The brand is great and the overall vibe is good.,"Senior management is like and old men club. Really old school. You need to be friends with senior management and flatter them to get noticed or to make any career progress. Also, there are so many layers of management that it is almost impossible to change processes of get things properly done or sorted, and by the time these are looked into, you are just indifferent. Everything takes for ever. From a manager to look at a small request, to making important tools or software available to you. Ultimately, there is no accountability whatsoever, so it is really easy to get unmotivated after little time. Arrogant attitude towards partners ... Fun place to work but for one year max."
422,3,Nice place for a young person......but then move on.,Manager,Free t-shirts and games. Decent pay.,"Nepotism + favoritism + ageism + blind faith  dysfunction. After making record profits in 2018, Sony Interactive Entertainment (also known as PlayStation) laid off a bunch of talented hardworking people a year later. Do you really want to work for a company that acts like that ? I heard Facebook and Google are hiring…. Sony is just another stupid corporation, and it is top-heavy with executives and directors. Like any other corporation, they treat staff unfairly, as there is a culture of nepotism, favoritism, ageism, and blind faith. Many older employees have been pushed out since 2015. Problems fester for years because the overpaid execs are too lazy to actually care. I was at Sony for 10+ years and I saw many smart, experienced people lose their jobs. Sony has a history of dumping smart, talented people. Their constant use of temp staff is extremely unethical. Sony has improved a little over the years, but it still has the common corporate problems: age discrimination, negative and chaotic management, lack of direction, lack of planning; lack of work-life balance. SONY Interactive is a nice place to work when you are young and need experience. But it's best to move on ASAP and get a job at Google, NVIDIA, Facebook, or Apple instead. Don't bother waiting for a promotion, because for many people it will never come.….You're better off jumping ship and going to some other company. Maybe in twenty years they will figure out how to grow up and be a smart company. All the free popcorn and t-shirts won't make up for the bad karma Sony has earned. Even when they make huge profits, much of that money gets sucked back to Sony headquarters in Tokyo, so your raise and bonus is not as great as it should be.Sony is still suffering from bad decisions that were made back in 2006 by upper management. Directors don't listen to staff, and they don't take time to communicate to the staff. Petty and passive-agressive behavior is standard among upper management. Sony is still having growing pains."
423,4,It is what you make of it,Internn,"was Able to essentially create a full time position for myself with responsibilities that another company may Not offer me. - Awesome co-workers.... enjoyed going to work every day - we were treated like adults, allowed to work from home whenever necessary. Just get your work done at a high level, and everyone is happy - Great opportunities to travel to SF, London, and/or Tokyo","- Sony is too big of an organization.

424,1,We are here to make money.,Software engineer,Free 12-month PS Plus .,"A good example that shows this company's ethics: About 1 year ago the company provided free 12-month PS Plus to its employees. What they did not say is that this will be an auto-renewal subscription. After 1 year employees have been charged $49.99 for the PS Plus renewal (BTW PS Plus really sucks), and If you request a refund of your money you have to wait 2 months. The company literally calls this refund a "" Gesture of Goodwill."" Like if it is coming from a higher power. This is how this company cares about its customers (its employees), they simply don't. They are in business to make money, they care less about your experience as a customer or employee."
425,2,Mediocracy Rules,Finance manager,"Employee discounts on Sony Electronics, PlayStation hardware and games","No collaboration between teams - everybody is fixated on their own P&L. Mediocre people, who know how to navigate the intricate politics thrive in this environment, where as motivated people who require recognition of their talent leave.

The work is varied, and you are unlikely to get stuck working in obsolescent technology. Job stability is very high and the pay is generally good.","Management has no vision. Most of the work you will do will never make it to market. Directions change faster than products are developed. It is very typical to let multiple departments compete to address the same need, resulting in multiple products, most of which are flushed.

429,2,Lost Its Way,Anonymous employee,"SCEA has great work/life balance. In the past, it provided great advancement opportunities. There were many social opportunities to interact with employees in other departments. People were very friendly. Paid time off at the holidays was awesome.","Management has been trying to improve the company for the past 3-4 years, but each change continues to diminish morale. New management does not value the contributions of the employees who built the company. ""Lifers"" has become a negative term instead of one of respect.

A lot of staff sit with social media up, or sit on their phones No progression - A lot of 2+ year staff with no promotion or raise in place. Paid at same level as new staff. Multiple teams with no say on who or what you work on. Erratic changes to staffing and assigned projects.

437,4,A very rewarding place to work,Anonymous employee,"Company values and goals have significantly changed during my tenure. Originally it was the Wild West, with corporate politics and petty small-office backstabbing leading the fray. Significant changes in middle management and new policies from upper management have changed the culture to the point where loyalty is desired and rewarded, rather than keeping ""King of the Hill"" silo-based ethics.","Despite the positive changes in culture, opportunities for advancement are still very limited and rare, primarily restricted to management-tier jobs.

441,1,Toxic Culture,Software engineering leader,"Good pay and benefits, nice perks, decent office, Starbucks, cafeteria.","Toxic culture all around. Ex-Intuit leadership uses bullying, intimidation, and public humiliation to strongarm people into their ways. Japanese culture is typical hierarchical, micromanagement, imitation of your superiors, rule following, and don't color outside the lines to command and control the staff. The result is there is no leadership at Sony because the focus is all on managing down to control the Engineers and tell them how to do their job. To add, since the Japanese culture is robotic and lacks human empathy, they do not understand or recognize the criticality of soft skills and human interaction in business leadership, so tend to make poor business decisions and hiring decisions."

At the same time, the existing senior Sony people have been squeezed out, quietly encouraged to leave, or just fired. No one from the original Sony Network San Diego in any position of responsibility and no one from the original Sony days has been promoted. There have been many new senior level positions filled, but none from within the company. Some have been given new titles, but no real promotions. Existing engineers have not been allowed to participate in the technical direction of the network. They are seen as hindrances and not as contributors. A closed environment of fear and distrust has been created where people cannot question direction or voice honest opinions. It's a dreary engineering environment lacking in excitement or peer collaboration."

The benefits are also top notch if you're a full time employee.,"Leadership lacks diversity. Heads are all older white males with the exception of 1 new executive hire.

459,2,"Good company philosophy -- poorly vetted, hostile management",Anonymous employee,"Many good people in the organization from diverse backgrounds; on-premises health club and cafe; hot food is available almost all day. Easy parking, safe work location.","Where do I begin? The hostility in this place is rampant. It exists at all levels, including the administration. Legacy employees live in silos and treat new employees with utter disdain. On the platform engineering side, the formerly-Intuit management solution to growth is to stack layers and layers of management between themselves and the worker bees. This is offset somewhat by the Japanese philosophy of owning the outcome - they force managers to rotate on-call; eating their own dog-food, so to speak. Instead of studying and refining current tools and processes, they create a new management position to address a shortcoming. Right now I have four managers between myself and a director. We have three engineers and one manager in my group. That's one manager for three people! Forget about fair consideration for a job. Some managers post jobs only as a necessary requirement, but could care less about outside candidates. I've seen highly qualified candidates completely overlooked because the hiring manager wanted to give that job to an old colleague or friend. If outside applicants had any idea, they probably wouldn't apply. Why should they? They'll likely get other offers before Sony gives them a chance. I can go on and on, -- the micro-managing, the meaningless gestures of generosity, the lack of coordination and standardization, etc., but I won't. But let me say this... if you apply at the Sony Taleo web site, and someday you get an email from Sony, be wary. The only reason why they would seem eager to hire anyone is to fill in a position that is badly understaffed. You'll get quickly hired thrown right into the fire, without even a semblance of proper guidance. Then what? Before you know it, you're stuck in a lousy job. And don't let them offer you a bonus with your salary negotiations. It's totally bogus. Unless you work 12 hour days and weekends and nights, you won't see squat for a bonus. I paid in blood, sweat and tears for this company, working weekends and nights and early mornings, only to be ""rewarded"" with a bonus that was a fraction of what was due. Sony pays out very little in bonuses even though the platform is making almost $8 billion this year alone! Over 1000 people work their butts off at SNEI to guarantee this 24/7/365 revenue stream for Sony, and for them to turn around and pay out a tiny fraction as a bonus is beyond insulting. It's a slap in the face. Don't waste your time with Sony Network Entertainment. Between the hostility, layers and layers of inept management, long, long hours and sheisty bonus payouts, there's very little reason to want to join this company. Which is too bad because I find the Japanese principals I work with --nationals from Japan-- to be wonderful people with honest and kind intentions. They're polite, generous, understanding, forgiving to a reasonable degree, and eager to come up with cool stuff, like the Playstation Network. It's the middle and upper management from the US and elsewhere that are ruining things for SNEI. This could be a much strong and more profitable company if it weren't for these management problems."
460,4,Senior Program Manager,Senior program manager,"The people, the technology, the environment, the cool factor of working at PlayStation, the fact that you work at a company that has customers who are not just customers they are fans! The executives are actually really cool people who do not sit on a pedestal. In fact, all of the management team and all of the individual contributors are genuinely sincere people who really care about the product and that's an amazing thing. The VPs and SVPs are incredible, approachable, knowledgeable, thoughtful and caring about the fans first. They practice what they preach for sure when it comes to being the best place to play (and work!) It's really an incredible place to work for so many reasons. The benefits and the perks and everything, I won't even describe because they're what you would expect… Simply amazing. It is definitely the coolest place I've ever worked and that's a high bar. There are so many great things to say about this company that I would probably spend the next hour writing them but I don't know if anyone would ever read all the amazing things I could say.","No clue how they ever delivered any product in the 20+ years before I got there. The process, or processes, are a total mess. No one business unit has any of the same or even similar processes - even with in the same business unit. Remember now, I am giving a four star review here because it is truly a pleasure to work there. It would be a 5 Star review....But, there are some serious deficiencies in how the company operates that have been solved at software and hardware companies years and years ago. Generally speaking, there aren't many egos to deal with but, there are a few and most of those come from the newer individual contributors, not the management team. Thankfully for the customers, a.k.a. fans, they make billions of dollars and can afford to make billions of mistakes and still deliver consistently. It's a crazy mystery I'll never understand but it does actually work I guess. The fact that no one knows who does what is the biggest challenge. Figuring out what people do in the company, because no one actually seems to know and I'm talking about people who have been there for years and years is amazingly difficult. AMAZINGLY DIFFICULT."

Eagerness on the part of management for associates to take on new roles and step into the green field.","A few too many ""Chefs"" created blurred roles at the top of the house.

The health and medical benefits were outstanding. Schedule was quite relaxed, so a good work/life balance was possible.","Things moved slowly.

Executive leadership is not always strategic, and decisions are made slowly. Accountability is poorly maintained in most organizations, and often is culturally set by specific leaders throughout the various groups.

475,2,"Be ready to deal with excessive levels of management and red tape, all for wages which are far below industry standards.",Software engineer in test,"Good offices, good location. Great projects to work on that genuinely have an impact on many many people. Other engineers can be great to work with.","Salary Biggest con about this company is the salaries they pay. In general they will greatly underpay it's employees because they are working for 'Sony'. And, as HR and many managers will phrase it, that privilege equates to lesser pay. It can take years of bonuses and wage increments for ones yearly pay to match what you'd get elsewhere in the same industry at far, far smaller organisations. This is particularly true for mid-level/senior engineers and employees in the lower levels of the archaic hierarchy who have little management influence in their day-to-day roles. Good pay if your a manager though. Management/Culture This is arguably what destroys employee dissatisfaction most within the organisation/department. Even more so within its own R&D department. This is entirely dependent on who your manager is, so this particular negative applies to my own department and some of the teams I worked with rather than the whole organisation. Management is filled with stagnated and decade-old middle managers (and in my particular case) who did very little to no actual work outside of organizing meetings and providing already-clear direction. Little to absolutely no room for personal growth. My own manager implemented absurdly authoritarian-like methods and checks to ensure engineers were hitting targets and not missing deadlines (e.g filling out detailed excel 'time-sheets' submitted weekly). Managers are never questioned as it is believed their experience equates to infallibility, and when problems do arise blame is quickly shifted beneath them when possible, or otherwise ignored and hushed when fingers cannot be easily pointed down the assembly line. This fostered an environment within engineering teams where we had to constantly proclaim and prove what we were doing. Animosity easily developed between co-workers new or old because of this and would quickly look for excuses or throw others under the bus to shift accountability. E.g: Managment: You reported in the time sheet you coded X feature, which took you Y hours, and Z lines of code (yes they count lines of code). This is bad it should have only taken you minimum X-6 hours (arbitrary estimation with little consideration of actual engineering challenges). Why are you under-performing? Person: I did what I could under the restrictions of teammate A not doing Task Con time, also blame this tool was broken and XYZ teams did not communicate and deliver, etc etc. I hope things have changed since I left because in particular one team at SCEE R&D has extremely high employee turnover for many years. Yet everyone seemed to casually ignore that perhaps the all-wise manager running the team and their methods were the actual cause of engineers leaving every 1-2 years."
476,3,"good company to get experience in, growth industry",Senior developer,"good for resume. experience in the gaming industry. The company has grown very fast so intercommunications are a little slow and organizational stuff is hard to organize. It takes a lot of time to get projects approved, and sometimes they get killled - i guess all big companies are similar.","big company downsides, nothing unsual. Too many discussions with all company branches, a lot of time wated on talking about projects instead of just doing them. Sony's different companies don't talk to each other a lot, this is improving a lot in the last 2 years, and might make sony a much better place to work in."

479,5,Great studio to work at,Character animator,"At Bend Studio, you work with some of the most talented people in the industry. Everyone is extremely motivated to produce their best work possible. They really push the limits as to what can and can't be done. If you're an outdoorsy person, the location is a huge plus. Plenty of hiking, mountain biking, camping minutes from the city limits. And if the snow's good, Mt Bachelor's only a 20-30 min drive.","It's the only entertainment company in Bend. So if by chance you end up looking for other work, you'll have to head north to Portland or Seattle, or obviously South towards the Bay Area or Socal."

Excellent facilities with numerous amenities (gym, pool, aerobics, etc.)","Our culture is heavily siloed and relies on ad-hoc individual contributions. There is a very need-to-know culture of secrecy around almost everything. I don't think anyone has spent any time developing and promoting wholesome institutional habits. So, everything falls on the shoulders of individuals and when they leave that bit of institutional knowledge inevitably goes with them."
481,2,Business is Business at Employees expense,Consumer service representative,"Good while it lasts, finally got 8 hours off every month PTO only to get laid off.","Employees are tools, that is all. Local Management more so. Jobs posted should have been filled long ago but no one is qualified to hire so they fall back on Temps or worse Interns. Business suffers and politics says all is well until the next lay off hits. Walked out whole Department midday, not allowed to say goodbye or get a soda. They do Fed-Ex your personal property at least."
482,1,"Negative, stressful, unorganized environment",Anonymous employee,"The food, coffee, and special events.","Senior management is negative and puts others down as if it's a game. This demeaning attitude is also reflected in people who work closely with management. You're constantly criticized by others and never given support/encouragement. This was a regular complaint I heard from peers. You would constantly hear employees in Procurement and Project Management complaining about how stressed they were. The managers are incompetent and promoted without any experience in their field, with bunk degrees (DeVry, Phoenix, etc.). They also hire family members without experience in their field. This makes it difficult for anyone with actual qualifications to work effectively and make improvements. Many employees are incompetent and don't reply to emails or phone calls."

Travelled to visit studios in the US, in Europe, and in Japan. I developed media and themes for Sony's internal developer conference, and managed posting conference sessions on the internal website for studios to share. Best job of my career - my boss gave me freedom to define my role as I thought it should be done.",All big companies have a fundamental flaw: lack of coordination among various disbursed groups. I learned to live with that in my 30+ year career in software development.
486,3,Good Hang,Marketing,"Atmosphere is low stress, people are great and the comp is decent. Most senior management are Sony lifers and not very brilliant or inspirational.

489,2,It's not a culture for everyone,Software engineer,"Benefits are great as far as San Diego employers go. They try to compete with Silicon Valley companies on this front. Pay is generous for the area, as far as I can tell. They are definitely willing to pay out for talent. There's a nice cafeteria on the 11th floor, where you can occasionally get an ocean view. There are also many fun activities for employees throughout the year: take your child to work day, happy hours, nice holiday party, video games, off campus events, etc.","Much of this is probably dependent on the team you are a part of. In fact that itself is a major con. The teams are generally very siloed. There is not a lot of communication across teams on the individual contributor level. The management style is very top-down. They pretend to be agile by implementing SAFe, but SAFe is a little too structured and too pre-planned to really be considered agile. The company is very inefficient. Most of the teams at the San Diego location are there to support infrastructure in some form or fashion, but yet there are always outages. The company would do well to outsource the infrastructure support and hosting to a vendor and focus on developing services. There are also cultural inefficiencies. For those that are unlucky enough to have a team with mostly Japanese management, you had better learn Japanese or else you can expect not to be included in any of the decision making process. There is an obvious divide in business culture: Japanese and everyone else. They do a lot to take care of employees (see the pros) but the management style and the inefficiencies just make you not care to try. There is such a culture of mediocrity, and so much of the work seems like work for the sake of work. If you are close to retirement age and looking for a place to just coast for the last few years, there is probably a position here where you can give minimal effort and not get a lot of grief for it."

492,2,"My experience, and for a few others",Qa functional tester,A gateway into other more permanent opportunities. Certainly gave me the power to seek something else after my experience. I made a few nice friends there.,"Toxic Environment, Poor Training, Favouritism, Lack of Opportunities. People are toxic to one another and step over each other for permanent positions. God forbid you actually get an interview, if youre not liked even with a lot of experience and knowledge, you wont be getting the job. Myself and a few other colleagues experienced the poor treatment to a few of us. This usually happened when they were thinking about letting us go just before our 2 years of service under the Yoh contract. Please get rid of agencies and begin to hire your QA staff permanently. The place is too toxic with everyone too scared to be let go, and so resort to trying to obtain a permanent position in any way that they can. Even if they try, if they arent very popular or dont live in Liverpool you can bet 100% theyll be ignored. Even if theyre hardworking. Seniors do more than the managers, or so thats how it appeared to me. People always left continously due to feeling underappreciated especially since the start of the pandemic. Where are the thank yous, gifts, and free PS5s which you gave to permanent Sony staff but not Yoh? Oh yes, and half-days, sick pay. Yoh get none of it, just 10p soda cans and a free game once a year. Its not enough for all the hours and effort we put in for you. Theyll get rid of you if you arent pulling your weight, or if you are will move you from title to title with no explanation making the experience harder. Great for CV, but not for work relationships and a sense of overall purpose there. Expect your colleagues to treat you as someone under them; acting like your boss. These are usually the ones who are trying to become a senior and unfortunately it always works. Theyll be horrible and get thanked for it. Like huh? Oh, I had 1 performance review from Yoh after 2 years and it lasted 10 minutes. Thats all I get? Thankfully I handed in my notice whilst being accepted into a studio, and I couldnt be more happier. The new place is much more welcoming, and actually cares about my progress. So please, if youre under a temporary contract treat it as temporary and dont attempt to stay. Unless you have old friends there, which a lot of them did. Filling the whole place with nepotism. If you live outside the area, your chances are much lower. Good luck. But I would avoid if I were you."
493,2,Mix of talent and pork,Producer,"Brand recognition, relatively competitive benefits package, office facilities were adequate for an office of this size, some SCEA perks were nice due to affiliation with Sony.

PSN is so profitable, particularly with PS+ their PSN subscription service, that every action is predicated on how much revenue gets sent back to Japan to invest in retooling SonyMobile and SonyElectronics, both in the toilet for years. On top of this the San Diego computer and warehouse effort is being shut down without anyone there knowing it's happening other than the new Intuit management brought in during 2015. The talent who realized this have all left, or they've gotten rid of their most senior staff by ""abolishing their jobs (code for laying off highly-paid professionals they know will resist their new ""QuickAndDirty"" #FauxAgile approach), and the lower-paid-less-experienced replacements are managing to introduce more outages than fewer. Outages will be the ONLY driver of churn once PS4 and XBox put their proprietary prowess on the cloud , relieving them of a $400 chunk of plastic and iron sitting on your shelf today. When this occurs, PSN's propensity to ""go down"" due to sloppy code, an out of control codebase, multiple copies of their database in multiple locations across the globe, and poor security will eventually tilt in Xbox's failure.

514,5,Very happy hear,Senior account manager,"Great work life balance, if you focus on it Mostly amazing, hard working, smart folks A strong focus (the TPR department) on mental health of their workers and external partner happiness Great benefits Strong leadership from the very top, enthusiasm and love for games and for what we do","Slow moving, but that's typical of a large company A few people who are just in it for the paycheck but that is rare"
515,4,Many opportunities for growth,Anonymous employee,Fast pace work environment due to competitive game industry and new technology result in many opportunities for individual and career growth.,HR and other corporate support groups and Sr Mgmt are not as much in line with the game side of the business and seem unable to keep pace with work environment changes and strain to provide proper support.
516,2,Upper management is lacking,Senior manager,Fun and exciting environment. Producing products with end user recognition and appreciation. Hard working and passionate colleagues.,Poor and uncommunicative upper management (director level and above). Slow career progression. Still disconnects and silos between groups in SCEA and with other Sony divisions.
517,4,"Wonderful atmosphere, but management should be more proactive",Manager,"Excellent products, genuine concern, effort and desire to make our products the best in the industry. Lots of opportunity to work with employees at every level. No formality or rigidity, very congenial atmosphere. Many really smart colleagues.","Some members of senior management are entrenched and distracted or otherwise insufficiently responsive to important issues as they arise. Payroll, finance and accounting systems are overly labor-intensive and are highly dysfunctional."
518,4,A Good and Fun Place to Work,Anonymous employee,"Fun industry and the ability to feel a part of the product. Good inter-functional cooperation, for the most part enables one to succeed on projects that require cross-functional participation.","Development costs have dramatically increased, making it ever more difficult to product profitable games which leads to a tendency to make ""safe"" bets (sequels, etc), which takes away some of the fun in creativity."
519,3,"OK, but has many challenges.",Anonymous employee,"It's a good place to work, and has excellent time off policies for that work/life balance. People are usually friendly and tend to help each other when needed. Strong brand name makes me feel proud to be at SCEA.",There's an increasing sense of political warefare. Management always reward their friends and don't appreciate the people underneath them. It can be unfair at times.
520,4,A lot of opportunity for growth,Anonymous employee,"Tons of work perks, great, young people and collaborative atmosphere. Working for SNEI is like working for a start-up company with a backing of a tech giant. Lots of opportunities to grow if you work hard.",Behind in technological innovations. There is a desperate need for different divisions of Sony to work better together for unified user experience and for innovation.
521,5,Great Company - Intern -> Full Time,Software engineer,"Very positive work place with nice and friendly people. Summer intern program is excellent. Learned lot of things from senior engineers and managers, got a chance to work on innovative projects. Exposure to senior members through speaker series. Competitive Salary. Fun events. This is a great place to start your career.",Nothing as of now :)
522,2,Some great people slow moving to catch up,Marketing,"Some groups are full of creative hardworking folks, but it varies from group to group. Overall being part of the video game industry is fun","SIlo'd groups, company is slow to change and share information. A lot of tenured people who are going through the motions, but new people as have a problem adjusting causing strife"
523,4,A good opportunity to be in the video game industry,Anonymous employee,#ERROR!,"- Very big entity with the ""corporate"" and ""bureaucratic"" attributes you might expect - Changes come slowly, if at all - Poor performing staff seem to remain in roles for too long (incl. management)"
524,5,Better than I imagined,Director,"The leaders are loyal, the employees love games and the campus is pretty sweet. Pay is okay, and no stock upside, but a very good base and always a good bonus if you have a good review.","It always feels like the management is a matrix. Decisions are made and then changed because someone has an issue. This slows down a lot of momentum. But the product is hot, so focus on the main business does not typically have issues."
525,4,A Solid Place to Work,Intelligence analyst,"Relaxing, fun atmosphere, with knowledgeable and professional co-workers. Amenities at work are good, and compensation is fair, if not good. The goals we worked toward were worthwhile.","The company doesn't do much to spread the benefits of working for them around. HQ got most of the attention when it came to amenities. Where I worked, on the operations side, there was not a lot of upward mobility. Most employees in my department were hired as contractors, and there seemed to be little consideration for them in the greater corporate plan."
526,4,"Great coworkers and work-life balance, but few opportunities for long-term career growth",Anonymous employee,Relaxed environment with great Work-life balance - Friendly and fun coworkers - fantastic culture - great environment to be in if this is your first corporate job or new to gaming or tech in general,a lot of emphasis on seniority rather than merit during promotions and performance reviews - Favoritism shown by executive management towards certain groups - Difficult to grow career-wise - No attempt to retain top talent--many high-performing employees poached by top companies - Below market pay
527,3,Identity Crisis,Systems administrator,"Free games, swag, and other discounted PS related merch and devices.","Benefits and pay are sub par compared to other Bay Area tech companies. This makes PS talent pool subpar as well. Had to move out because it was a top heavy org, no upward mobility despite high performance."
528,3,Mixed feelings.,Anonymous employee,"Met some great people, learned a lot about the industry. Sony does give decent benefits, also.","No training, difficult management--but in my department specifically, I can't speak for others. The company worked in silos for so long, bridging gaps is sometimes difficult. The open office floor plan is awful for certain groups, and should have been optional."
529,4,Good time there,Anonymous employee,Got a lot of time to play and met really cool people. We were able to play the games earlier than the rest of the word and that was awesome.,Had played that much that my job was not being done hence got fired. The next time i will wait untill i finish my job so i can play
530,3,"Fun, Interesting but Yellow Badge BAD",Associate producer,Projects are really fun and interesting. Co-workers are smart and good fun to be around. My supervisor was hardworking but easy-going and very supportive of the team.,Difficult to navigate politics with a few key people clearly holding the power & protecting themselves/friends--at times to detriment of business. Yellow badges are a nightmare. You have all of the responsibility but none of the protections or dignity of regular employees.
531,3,"Pay is good, culture could be better",Anonymous employee,"The pay and benefits are good. Free games, discounts on other Sony stuff. Good amount of PTO. Coworkers are nice and helpful.",Management does not communicate well. Sometimes unsure of expectations. Not sure of what is important. Supervisor is secretive and sneaky. Not trustworthy or helpful when problems come up.
532,1,Serious managerial issues,Technical architect,It's a gaming company and there are quite a few perks that go with that like relaxed social atmosphere and dress code,Management is very confused and out of touch and manage the company through a series of disparate fiefdoms without aligned goals or a cohesive strategy.
533,4,"Good Company Culture, but...",Principal software engineer,Great company and good culture,"However, there are some really bad managers who makes it deliberately difficult for everyone that are working under them and with them. Some notable mentions are perfeng and cicd team managers, for their awful and confrontational management style."
534,1,Treated like garbage.,Qa professional,It's an easy job. It is considered experience in the video game field. Casual dress.,"This is only as a QA tester. Intimidated into working overtime. It was alluded to that you would lose your job if you opt out (which I did after 6 straight months of doing it). Overtime was, and is common to be 12 hours a day 6 days a week and an 8 hour shift on Sundays. I was diagnosed with carpal tunnel issues in both of my wrists due to this overtime but was still asked to do the overtime as soon as the doctor released me."
535,4,"Fun enviroment, ok management",Senior department assistant,Social dynamic is great. Office atmosphere is casual. Compensation is good. In San Diego location you can bring dogs on campus. The company has a operates like a startup without budget issues.,No direction from uppen management. Very difficult to be promoted within the company. No good direction for improvement. Entry to mid level employees are hardly noticed
536,5,Awesome place to work,Anonymous employee,"The benefits are good. The San Diego campus is easy to get to and in a great location commute-wise. When you speak up, your direct management will listen. Management makes an effort to help push you forward with your own career goals in mind.",Needs more accountability on the individual scale. People hurt productivity by not understanding their own roles better in the development process.
537,4,Great company and workforce - needs better focus on opportunity advancement and resourcing,Senior software development engineer in test (sdet),"Fun things to work on Work/Life Balance Highly skilled individuals Equipment, office, and general community is very strong","Resourcing is always a problem in satellite offices Satellite offices have drastically reduced compensation for similar work Politics Bonus structure used as ""motivation"" to work extra hours"
538,3,Has its highs and lows,Anonymous employee,It's an awesome brand to be a part of. You can find some great people here and have the opportunity to be a part of some very cool projects.,"Career paths and growth potential feel near non-existant, employees feel out of the loop and unfortunately often unappreciated. It does sometimes feel like they depend on the brand name to bring in top-talent, but it doesn't seem that top-talent stay very long. Some departments are in need of a complete overhaul from a talent perspective."
539,4,"Smart people, hard work",Anonymous employee,Benefits are decent and the pay is around or above market value for the area. Most employees are pretty friendly and laid back. Work is interesting and challenging. Management is pretty tech savvy.,Not too much interaction between different teams. Most people don't know what other teams are working on. Management structure is pretty flat so there is little room for career progression.
540,4,Love my job,Anonymous employee,"Fast-paced, works like a startup, working with newest technologies and building a lot of new applications and processes. Open to innovation. Very nice people. Small enough, yet solving big problems. Great product. Pays well",Some political vestiges of old regimes and people not understanding that we need to move forward and quickly. Some silo mentality that blocks quick implementation and execution
541,3,Harboring incompitence,Producer,You don't have to worry about getting fired. They operate like a studio instead of a technology company so it's easy to get up to speed.,Good Ideas never see the light of day and bad Ideas never get killed. Japanese culture instills a process of conscious which is extremely detrimental in a technology company. No one is given decision making power.
542,4,Overall a very good company to work for.,Anonymous employee,"People are friendly, easy going and motivated. I see this when we have people volunteer for a flash mob dance at a recent event and also during a habitat for humanity outside the country. Everyone is also focused on the department goals and work in general.",For my department. No to little upward mobility and one has to check positions from other department although management has implemented some exposure (i.e. shadowing people) to other departments and other positions.
543,1,Worst place to work for. Promote office bullies across the entire sales department.,Anonymous employee,Free coffee and milk. Free food and old games ocassionally.,"Salaries are not competitive, and much lower than other companies in the area. Career advancement is driven by favorism, not ability, performance, or hardwork. Managers and directors abuse their power, bully, and mistreat employees. Their behaviors are unprofessional and immature like high school bulliers than working professionals. People do nothing due to fear for their career. Many support or even copy these behaviors creating toxic work environment across the entire sales department."
544,5,Awesome Place to Work,Anonymous employee,"Always something new and exciting. Opportunity to work with awesome people, work in a true multinational corporation. Opportunity to learn lots of new technologies and work on diverse products. Always popular when find out you work at Playstation. Always learning. Amazing benefits.",With a full multinational company its never truly asleep to learning to adapt to an environment that follows the sun takes time. Sometimes takes a bit longer to reach consensus .
545,4,Decent company with fun end products,Manager,"Benefits are good, and some of the people are great.","Employee experience will differ greatly between work units. Company as a whole does not function as a single unit, but rather many different companies with no real common goal or direction. Most support groups have the sell their services to internal groups. Egos run big in this company. Have seen successful programs shut down because a different group felt they should be in control."
546,4,Good place to work,Anonymous employee,"Good benefits, Nice campus, my team is great and we get to Work on really cool products that consumers love - Leadership team at PlayStation is getting better, I can see they are making strides to make PlayStation a competitive workplace in the Bay Area","- Career development is a bit unclear, but HR is working on improving - Work/life balance is a struggle - It's discouraging to see employees skate by and slack off get away with it, especially when some of the teams work so hard"
547,3,Manager Programming,Anonymous employee,"If you can find a great team, the experience will be very rewarding. Lots of room to try new things and grow across a spectrum of possibilities.",A bit Aimless. Unless the teams are making a sequel to an existing title there's a lot of waste spent trying to figure out what the next title should be.
548,4,PlayStation product development,Anonymous employee,"Benefits are competitive, bonuses vary but are generally decent, potential for variety of work, dedicated employee base, considered generally prestigious to be employee","Management structure can be nebulous, many silos within company, job security not what it once was as temporary employees more widely used to contain benefit costs, lots of fat in middle management"
549,5,Good Working Environment,Project manager,"SNEI offers good benefits, good salary, casual and amicable atmosphere, opportunities for improvement and training.The company keeps growing and there is a lot of diversity, teams are very helpful.","Work is constant and very aggressive, need improvement on their processes and standards. Need to balance some work, some teams are overworked."
550,3,"Good people, lots of politics",Anonymous employee,Liked the people I worked with. Everyone genuinely wants to do great things but efficient decision making is lacking. Great bonuses. Fun environment.,"Lots of politics in a local and global level. Slow to create progress or make decisions, which almost always bars creativity and great work from being completed. You do the same thing all the time with every program. Pay is far below industry average. A. If culture of fear."
551,1,Waste of time,Supply chain,Nice colleagues to work with Offices in central london Free drinks and free fruit Free Gym,Incredibly disorganized company Blame culture Manager not qualified Heavy workload due to the useless manager not able to take responsability. I was working in a small team of 4 with the manager that was there just to supervising us - not even able to long into the system or to provide training to new starters. Awful experience. Plus the company does not support or value their employees!!! shame on you Sony Playstation
552,4,Decent play to work,Executive assistant,-They hire people you want to work with; they become your family (in a good way) -The company is trying to make it worth a place you want to stay,"-Not every department is equal: some departments are the ""fun"" cool departments and others are the hard gruelling, no work-balance department -There are some lazy people who work here and stay because leadership lacks the ablilty to let go of lazy people"
553,4,PlayStation is just as fun as you would imagine.,Product marketing manager,The culture is very open and everything revolves around the consumer which is something I havent seen in many other companies. The way that management gives freedom to its groups allows for greater creative freedom to develop ideas (always taking into consideration the needs of its consumers),Sony corporate policies can sometimes overshadow the PS irrelevant culture. Bureaucracy and antiquated processes create some major frustrations when it comes to executions.
554,2,Bottom Line,Anonymous employee,"Good people, Fun atmosphere, Flexible environment, Events, Discounts","Low pay No benefits Lack of opportunities to move up - despite their facade of ""attempts"" to promote. Layoffs abound Be prepared to do the job of a higher paying position, without the pay increase, benefits or title."
555,5,Data Scientist,Data scientist,"manages external expectations & adaptable to internal capacity. - Upwards trajectory in terms of culture, projects, outlook",Friends will ask you every week if you can get them a discounted PS55 - Not as quick as a start-up
556,5,Awesome environment!,Anonymous employee,Really relaxed environment with lots of really chill people. Definitely get to see a lot of diversity in the studios - and everyone here has a huge passion for the gaming industry,Little disorganized and frustrating trying to get things through higher corporate levels. Sometimes too many different departments and it can be confusing as to who's in charge of what.
557,3,Great products and fun environment; Lacking Senior Leadership,Marketing,Great products and a total blast to work with the fun people. Good competitive industry full of great smart people.,Lack of direction from Senior Management. Don't take great care of employees as it is a 'privilege' to work there. Not competitive salaries for same reason.
558,3,A place best suited for entry to mid level developers and managers; experienced professionals need not apply,Software engineer,company name recognition; fairly flexible hours outside crunch times; values testing and quality assurance,Crunch times occur often; below average pay rate (common to have salary / bonuses haggled); management changes / reverses design and/or implemenation decisions mid-sprint / mid-project regularly
559,4,SCEA,Anonymous employee,"Motivating work if you have an interest in video games, and especially in PlayStation itself. People are friendly, and there is opportunity for growth.",Compensation seems lower than other companies in the computer entertainment industry. There are some organizational silos between groups. Each group looks after holding its own interest instead of working as a whole.
560,5,Best Job I've ever had!,Network engineer,"Great work environment, interesting work, cool people... Lots of training, good budget for gear. Management is competent. Results oriented.","None. Anything negative I might say would be petty. I guess you could say that we have more work than we could possibly do (and we do) but the management knows this, and doesn't make people work themselves to death to do the impossible. They set priorities. But there's just not enough time in the day!"
561,3,"Pay is good, culture could be better",Anonymous employee,"The pay and benefits are good. Free games, discounts on other Sony stuff. Good amount of PTO.

599,3,A lot of amazing people to work with but pay very poorly,Advanced engineer,A lot of amazing and smart people A lot of interesting technology to work on,Really bad pay compared to other companies You rarely will be doing R&D work. Salary bonus is a joke. Most of the time people get 4% of salary bonus
600,5,The best place I’ve ever worked.,Security operations administrator,"I am so fortunate to work at a place where the employees are so highly valued. I don’t even know where to start- the work is fun, engaging and challenging. Leadership treats us with respect, and the benefits are unbelievable. The company culture makes me feel right at home.",Nothing. I can not think of a single thing I don’t like about working at PlayStation.
601,2,Varied experience,Anonymous employee,"Many people are in their dream jobs, making video games for a living. Really smart, hard working people in a mostly relaxed, fun atmosphere. Generous training policy.",Game teams definitely have to crunch near title launch. Some game projects get cancelled; that's just the nature of the industry. Most managers have promoted through technical or design backgrounds. Very few have strong management skills.
602,3,"Good people, lots of politics",Marketing,"Some very good people to work with, nice location, decent perks.","If your VP is connected well, your group will do well. Pick the wrong horse and your department will get absorbed into a different one. That's not unique to this place. Future outlook is murky. Vita needs to do better. Everything is riding on ps4. If it doesn't do well, it will be the end."
603,2,Anti-Innovation,Anonymous employee,"Sony is a large company with lots of hardware and software opportunities, people coming into Sony are excited to be part of what could be an amazing place for innovation within design and engineering.","Massive amount of blocking from self-promoting management on ideas and innovation. Most people leave within a year, them that stay are locked by political handcuffs."
604,5,Exciting place as a software engineer.,Software engineer,"If you have a good engineering skill, there are a lot of opportunities to be engaged in state-of-the-art gaming technology. There are also a lot of talented people and you can build good connections.","It is difficult to change the efficiency of the development process. It seems a bit inefficient to me. Because of lack of training aid, you need to improve your skill by yourself. Good external connections will help you a lot."
605,4,The Good and the Bad,Systems administrator,Some of the best people work here. Teams seem to want to help each other but can be territorial at times.,Murky management decisions. Sometimes it is hard to understand Japanese corporate culture. As a company ran from a far (Corporate is a separate entity) it can be frustrating when guiding decisions are mandated without consideration of each department unless they have a local representative fighting for them.
606,4,"Great place to start QA career, but the job is not guaranteed.",Qa tester,"Chance to work on many different titles, paid holidays, fair amount of secondment opportunities, summer/winter parties, free snacks + fruit.","You start off as a contractor, meaning you could lose your job at any moment, most the people I started with were fired. You also don't get as many benefits as permanent staff, no sick pay."
607,3,"Great place if you're into videogames. Management was questionable as they were ""worker bees"" versus ""leaders.""",Senior project manager,Average benefits and good discount off of Sony consumer electronics. Good place for kids straight out of college to work.,"Not only is every division of Sony Corp in separate silos, but each dept at SCEA is in different silos. Company lacks future vision of the Kutaragi years and plateau'd after PS3 launched."
608,4,Happy,Anonymous employee,"Atmosphere, management (locally, at least). Not a corporate environment. Creative, driven people.","Location in Playa Vista a bit remote. In the rare instances of having to deal with ""corporate"" (HR, Finance), I am driven to madness."
609,1,Politics are ruining the previous energetic atmosphere,Software developer,"The people are great for the most part, everyone buckles down and gets things shipped when crunch time, and nobody gets on our case when there's a light workload.","I hadn't heard of a real firing for years, but now it's rampant. Demotions are all the craze these days, the atmosphere from we're getting from the top is that they don't care about us. They fired our scrum masters, I have yet to meet one person who thinks this was a good decision - everyone agrees that it sucks. The bureaucratic nonsense is frustrating - copy everything from one website and place it to another site to show other people who don't like looking at the first site. This new crew is causing gossip where there was very little before, they are scaring everyone away and there is no end in sight, and no positive gain either."
610,1,Not All Groups are Same-Toxic Management in My Group,Senior business analyst,Some of the tools and processes were fun to work with. I tried creating my processes and had fun doing that,"I heard some other groups are fun and good to work with but I worked for the Business Analytics group within Operations and it was very stressful! Assigned work did not match people's skill sets. QAs were asked to do BAs work and vice versa. Favoritism and micromanagement runs high in the group. Several people have left or were let go. If you apply for Sony, other groups may be fine but not this group. Cons outweigh the pros in this group."
611,5,Love the atmosphere!,Anonymous employee,"Encouraged to try new things - my team lead promotes creativity and supports efforts toward improvements. Personal development is encouraged. Great compensation and love all the cool perks (such as free donut Fridays, PlayStation vouchers, video consoles in the lobby, access to great gym).",A small minority of folks are not open to change - but this is not unusual to a company so is not really a unique con.
612,2,"No leadership, toxic culture, avoid RB location at all cost.",Staff software engineer,"decent office space good facility including a cafe, gym and indoor garage",pay below market level performance/promotions measured by distance from leaders few capable line managers rampant office bullying no care of employees' life work balance
613,4,Work Life Balance,Senior product manager,"Fun working environment, great work/life balance. Great on site cafe and work out facility","Management, management, management. Either good manager but, not strong enough to outweigh bad popular strategies for the company or bad manager with 'power' to make non strategic or profitable decisions for the company. There are definitely some good/strong managers in the bunch."
614,4,Great place to work,Anonymous employee,"Amazing brand with products that customers love. You get the resources you need to get the job done. Plenty of smart, talented people across the company.","It's part of a much larger global corporation with many different divisions, so you'll have to deal with the red tape and silos that are typical of large companies."
615,2,A hot mess of employment law violations,Anonymous employee,Big name titles Looks great on CV Good freebies,"New HR teams more interested in protecting management and ""segregating"" Sony from Yoh Bullying allowed to occur frequently with targets of abuse being punished or forced out Sexual harassment swept under the carpet Rampant favoritism"
616,3,"At Sony Format QA, the atomosphere of the work place is very friendly and relaxing.",Qa professional,Most permanent QA testers stick around for a long time and no one quits volunteerly.,There are some child-ish customs and regulations set by the management at FQA department (set by the supervisor).
617,3,Greatness Awaits?,Video games,New campus and cafeteria are nice. Good product that gamers are enthusiastic about.,"Outdated corporate culture, slow to adapt to new technology. Hasn't incorporated the mobile culture that now dominates silicon valley. Nepotism across the organization, candidates are hired and receive promotions based on previous business relationships. The existing workforce though qualified, stagnates. Open reqs get filled through the back door and then posted to 'Career Opprtunities'."
618,5,Intern to Full-time,Cloud engineer,great company with a great work culture,there needs to be better onboarding documentation
619,1,Absurdly backwards place to work. Gives the game industry a bad name.,Functionality tester,"- Good for your CV Many companies will be impressed by your Sony Playstation experience in future interviews. - Suitable as a ""job-between-jobs"" Meaning if you're thinking of leaving your current job, use this position while you look for your next one as it's only beneficial as a short-term solution.","- Supports 'crunch culture' I found myself being immensely overworked during a deadline period of a project. Overtime pay is decided by the managers. It is commonly known amongst employees that rejecting an offer of overtime will inevitably become one of the reasons to terminate your role. Project management is disgustingly unprepared and unplanned which leads to many times to crunch. This should not be happening anymore in this industry. - Extremely toxic office culture Office is one big clique and is full of favouritism. If you don't believe in becoming friends with a certain group of people then your time there will be short. It seems that only people inside this clique are the ones to become promoted or be given work on the bigger, more exciting projects. - ""Yoh!"" Yoh is a staffing/outsourcing company. When you work as a contract tester for Playstation, you're actually working for Yoh and will get few, if not none of the Playstation benefits. Yoh as a company also bankrolls the U.S military and U.S firearms and this is something that will get your contract terminated if you're caught talking about while in the office. - Zero job security You've probably already picked this up from the points above, but as a functional tester you have zero job security. You will have a rolling contract which can be terminated at any time. You will be constantly reinforced by test leads and managers that you're doing a good job and that there's nothing to worry about, only to be handed your termination letter a week later. - Disgusting Salary During my time there I was earning less than £15,000 p/y which went up by a small amount every year, and I can imagine it's probably just over that now. It's better than nothing, obviously, but be aware that they're not paying you what you're worth, and they take advantage of that while they earn more than triple. Here's a piece of advice: You can get a permanent testing role in most (better) game companies for at the very least £18,000 p/y or even more if you move down South."
620,3,Close to Decade of service. Decent and sometimes disorganized functionality,Anonymous employee,Make you own schedule and route. Community outreach was encouraged,No upward mobility. Sometimes a divide between how Reps were treated and how corporate workers were treated. Projects were unpredictable at times forcing reps to choose between family life and satisfying the interjected project.
621,4,Fun company but lots of politics,Anonymous employee,Great brand and product Amazing office location Opportunities to work on interesting projects,"Pay is less than the industry average You don't get competitive pay increases each year - need to move to keep in line with the industry A lot of internal politics Like with most companies of this size, the next restructure is never far away"
622,4,Sometimes really great,General manager,Some are very talented people. The Japanese I work with are very open. Not a company that is afraid of making things.,A lot of reorgs in the last 2 years. Hard to get things done. Lots of politics. Sometimes too many people in meetings not getting enough done.
623,3,SCEA,Anonymous employee,"SCEA has excellent benefits, and working there provides the opportunity to contribute to world class technology on a leading gaming console.",Getting onto the right team is critical as some teams run like a well oiled machine while others are unfathomably dysfunctional.
624,2,Used to be the greatest place to work,Senior staff software engineer,"Creative, highly motivated environment. A dream job for an engineer. Japanese company loyal to employees. Good at life work balance.","Sinking industry. Sinking company. Short-sighted and inept management. Terrible at keeping talent. Disfunctinal teams all across departments. In spite of much effort, lots of silos across the organization."
625,3,PlayStation,Anonymous employee,Fun place to work. Cool products and great brand. Video game industry is very dynamic and fast paced. Great perks and discounts on products.,Hard to move and advance within the organization. Highly political and senior management does not do a very good job of promoting or mentoring.
626,2,Manager,Anonymous employee,It's a stable and big company - some perks that come because of that,"Horrible management, rampant use of H1bs at lower levels, management doesn't really care about measurable outcomes - all that matters is how you look to upper management. If you are actually talented or good at what you do, don't come here"
627,4,Family Forever,Anonymous employee,"Great place with friendly fun co-workers. - Room to grow professionally. - Family environment. - Great work life balance, if you want it.","- Low salary for industry and especially low for Silicon Valley. - Top talent gets poached by top 3 companies (FB, Google, Apple). - No attempt to retain top talent. - Nepotism"
628,3,"Decent place to start, but not enough opportunities for long term career.",Functional qa tester,"People are friendly, relaxed office atmosphere, free snacks/fruits and a solid place to get a foundation level of QA experience.","Not enough opportunities for a long term career, there is lots of competition for senior positions, training is rushed but you get the hang of things quickly."
629,4,Great place to work but not a great deal of opportunity to progress,Anonymous employee,"Great people, culture and generally a fun place to work",Not a lot of opportunity to progress and can end up pigeon holed in the industry. Generally systems and technology aren't at the level you would expect. Salaries and packages aren't at the level you would expect
630,1,Do As I Say.....,Senior software engineer,"On-site cafeteria, on-site fitness center, library of low-end PlayStation games, free beverages. The majority of the engineers and middle-level management are great to work with.","The untouchable new ""leadership"" kills all desire to be productive as everyone is scared to open their mouth or make a wrong move. Any previous creativity has been replaced by fear."
631,4,Great place to work for those who embrace challenge,Anonymous employee,"Exciting, dynamic, always changing and lots of opportunity for those who are self motivated",Always changing which may be a challenge for those who do not like to keep reinventing themselves
632,1,"So much potential, yet such a bad work environment",Anonymous employee,"So many fun challenges of a growing business, there are some real interesting problems to solve.","SNEI does not provide an environment where creativity, out of the box thinking and intelligence is rewarded. In fact, it's the opposite. People with mediocre technical and management skills but great political skills are rewarded, and change is highly discouraged. No one manages downward, everyone is managing upwards, and the mediocre managers are terrified that people will discover their lack of technical understanding and lack of management skills, this fuels a fear-driven culture. Good people get thrown under the bus all the time and they just leave. If you decide to do something that's good for the business, watch your back. Sadly, SNEI's approach to address the lack of collaboration is by introducing heaps and heaps of process/bureaucracy. Meetings are sad, no one listens to one another, people are just on their computers, not paying attention. I've seen executive VPs watch Youtube videos on their mobile phones during meetings. Upper management is so far removed from the daily layers of execution it's no surprise. It's as if there's no one at the helm of the ship. With all that said, there are pockets of solid teams under very competent managers that really work to create a collaborative environment, but they still seem to be the minority and in all cases these are managers that were hired from other companies."
633,3,Far away from being comparable with big companies,Anonymous employee,Gaming company culture and people,"While other companies are being extremely flexible with their employees, letting them work remotely from anywhere, SIE is making a big deal about it and not letting people work from a different location (outside California). There is no flexibility whatsoever in letting people move to a different campus, for example."
634,3,So Much Potential,Anonymous employee,So much potential to revive one of the greats in the industry.,Slow to adapt and the risk aversion is preventing the organization from truly being nimble.
635,3,Good experience to move foward...,Anonymous employee,The projects I was able to work on was very rewarding (personally).,"...It was sad to know that management did not know my daily work, and were constantly asking what I was working on every day. I thought that as a manager, this person should definitely know what I'm working on, I mean, I got hired for the specified job that was listed right?"
636,5,Love This Company!!,Anonymous employee,"Wonderful culture, great people, fun place to work, good benefits, beautiful main campus, creative, and if you love video games, this is the place for you","Depending on the role you are in, there is limited mobility unless you move to a different department or function. Cost of living in the Bay Area is nuts..."
637,3,You can be fired,Senior software engineer,Good Benefits Latest Technology Company on profits,You are asked to work outside of office hours. You are expected to be on mobile. You have to deal with persons who are politically motivated. no cooperation between teams. Back talking against you.
638,4,Good fair employer albeit bureaucratic,Lead environment artist,"Great benefits like a decent pension scheme, profit share and top health insurance. They offer plenty of clear career paths and courses and resources to improve.",Being such a large company they tend to be quite bureaucratic. Getting ideas pushed forward can take forever. Trying to move between the different studios is very tedious.
639,4,SCEE Game Design,Game designer,"Friendly and professional. Mostly experienced and knowledgeable staff. On the whole, far more positives than negatives. Still trying to get that elusive work/life balance right.",Still lots of hangovers from the Psygnosis days. Some reticence to change. Sony are generally reluctant to try something radical and new.
640,4,Product Manager,Product manager,"Great life-work balance. Fast growing company, creating many opportunities to impact the organization","Though the brand name suggests cutting edge technology, the company is behind in so many aspects. I would love to see them not only catch up but leading the pack upholding the brand."
641,5,Great people and product,Anonymous employee,"- People love the products, the PS4 in particular - Colleagues are great and fun - Good parties - Cool brand to work for",- Politics between EMEA and US especially - People in leadership have been there a long time and can be conservative - Sony getting involved more which means the brand is a bit less cool
642,4,Slow and steady but cutting edge,Anonymous employee,Good work/life balance (hours are reasonable) Amazing network/tech/security foundation and infrastructure Very smart Very stable product,Seems easy to get stuck being the sole owner of projects until someone leaves Needed a culture club to try and breath some life into the office environment C level execs were mostly absent. CEO made an appearance once every couple months. CTO seems to be on permanent vacation (seriously).
643,1,"Seemed like a great opportunity, but was one of the worst jobs of my life",Anonymous employee,I got a ton of free games in the three months I was employed as a PlayStation Representative. I liked being able to set my own schedule to a certain extent.,"Where do I begin. The pay is incredibly low for the amount of work you have to do. Getting shipped boxes every week and opening and organizing them all the time is time consuming in itself. My favorite account to work with was GameStop. I think the KPI metrics need to be revisited. Associate Engagement is a complete waste of time when Target, Best Buy, and Wal-Mart employees don't really care. There are a rare few that do though in those accounts. I received a warning for scheduling a day off on a day I was originally planning to work at the last minute. However, when you need to constantly schedule demo events and product trainings and a store calls you to confirm, sometimes you need to make last minute changes to avoid overtime, which is it what I did. I felt micro managed, which is something I despise. Just let me schedule my stores and events and you can view that in ROAM. The ROAM software is complete garbage. It's slow and I got a warning I wasn't writing detailed comments for my visits. Well, in the surveys, you ask what I'm doing, so I don't feel a need to write it down twice. Time keeping is a joke in itself. They need to really use Workday or Shift Planning or some other time tracking app because entering time in ADP and ROAM and then calculating your drive time is a mess in itself. HR told me I could work as much OT as I wanted, but I got a warning the first time I did, so I felt lied to. All in all, I didn't have a work/life balance and that is moist important to me."
644,3,Can be great if you are in the right spot.,Anonymous employee,All the fun and challenge that comes with working on Sony entertainment products.,"Ego-intoxication. Those few immature (regardless of age) managers in Japan, US and UK who skillfully undermine the company in service of their personal ambition."
645,4,Great place to work and have fun,Anonymous employee,Decent salary with annual bonus. Free games and great discount on Sony's game and electronic products. Good people around you including management.,Not the highest paid salary with small raise each year. Some free food but not every day like Google. Few employee activities.
646,4,Legal,Anonymous employee,Great collaborative environment. Most talented pool of dedicated and passionate employees. If you like being a part of creative and fun work enviroment-apply at playstation :),I felt that there were limited opportunities for women. Predominantly male-centric company. Lack of internal promotability which results in attrition of key talent.
647,1,"Sony City (HQ) - Tokyo, Japan",Anonymous employee,"Stability, job security. It's very unlikely that people are fired or ""let go"" in Japan. They simply ""move"" people to the most mundane positions/teams in the hope that they will just quit. (Just google ""japan forcing-out rooms""). I even know of a woman who is a complete alcoholic and pretty much just sleeps at her desk all day, but no one can fire her. Japanese rules! So if that appeals to you then it could be classed as a ""pro"". Lots of nice people work here. Genuinely nice and polite people - even upper management. Not so much overtime. This was a concern for me because we've all heard of those crazy hours that the Japanese work, but actually in my team we do a 10 - 6:30 day. Occasionally people stay a bit later but its rare. Other teams (engineers & developers) seem to do longer hours but I'm not sure. Canteen/food court - meals are generally good with lots of choice and basically quite cheap (yes, not free). Typically a lunch meal comes to 600 - 800 yen. You can sleep anywhere and at anytime. Seriously, people sleep at their desks, in meetings (oh yes!), in the communal areas...pretty much anywhere. I've never done this, but it seems acceptable.","The work environment and atmosphere are torture. Seriously, it is not a surprise that people commit suicide as much as they do (oh yes they really do). This isn't a problem specific to Sony HQ of course, many Japanese companies suffer from this. But honestly, the office space is cramped, dark, messy, overcrowded, outdated and very bleak. Hard to stay positive some days! The ""salaryman"" salaries are low in Japan. Seriously, nothing compared to EU or US. Plus there are no benefits - seriously, nothing. No discounts on PS (or Sony products), no freebies, no launch parties, no Xmas parties (well, we get a 2 hour bingo session with a few drinks and snacks), no training to non-Japanese, no off-site team-building...we even pay individually when our manager calls for a team meal & drinks in the evening. You get your salary, you get your bonus and that's it. Very little chance for career development. Japanese people work for years and years until they are ""the right age"" just to finally get promoted to team leader of manager. There is very little internal movement opportunities for non-Japanese. 8 months ago I contacted HR to express my interest in broadening my career by moving to a new team or at least hearing of any internal opportunities, after a brief response confirming that they understood my request I never heard from them again. Toilets- there are 26 floors and each floor has about 300+ people (mostly men), yet there are just 9 cubicles on each floor. People actually queue up and wait outside the cubicles. There's a clock-in / clock-out system. You know how you see in old movies of factory workers punching their cards in and out? Well, now its digital but basically the same. And if you are not making core hours for the month then you are forced to use your annual holiday. Seriously, I missed core hours by 1 minute once - yes, just 1 minute - and I was told by HR that I must use half a day holiday."
648,2,"Decent company, but hostile environment in my department.",Corporate finance,It is rewarding to have a career at this company if you are passionate about the industry and about being part of the whole picture.,There is poor work/life balance for the majority of the departments and the politics you find at companies of this size.
