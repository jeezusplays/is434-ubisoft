4,1,One of the worst,Anonymous employee,Small perks like freebies once in a while.,"50% of immediate co-workers are assassins who have no qualms backstabbing you to gain favour with the Japanese management. Japanese management side with each other and help each other to promote. Extreme favoritism and bias-ness, no career progression for you no matter how talanted you are if you don't bootlick them. Super manual jobscope that can be eliminated with better systems. Decent starting pay but you won't get any higher without bootlicking as well. Make tons of excuses to deny promotion yet promotion is granted to best friends and bootlickers who have minimal contributions. If you're new or young, forget about trying to make an impact as they deem you to be inexperienced and your word can't be taken for. Horrendous company."

Rigid rules, hierarchical, poor work-life balance, yes-man employees are preferred, etc. There is also bias based on gender and nationality which anyone can infer from their upper management structure. Internal processes and tools are manual and outdated, which is surprising for a tech company."

We aren't solving for world peace or saving lives so the stress isn't at a crisis level. There's just enough to fuel your days with some excitement. Working here is different than any company I have ever worked for. First, people of all backgrounds seem to want to work here--there is no shortage of people applying to our jobs. Second, we have incredible benefits at an affordable cost. And our benefits are expansive--IVF coverage, backup child care, etc. --amazing! Third, the people PlayStation is bringing in are best-in-class leaders who are helping shape the future of the company. It's a great time to join. Forth, we stand by the communities we live in. PlayStation committed $100M to social justice to improve lives and increase opportunities for underrepresented groups. Our commitment at PlayStation to DE&I is like nothing I have ever seen. Fifth and final comment: the people here are very supportive of one another and friendly. It's a happy workplace.","PlayStation at times can seem like a giant start-up. There's a lot of transformational work happening. If you are someone who wants to go where everything is perfectly laid out for you, this isn't the right place to work. Critical thinking skills are needed here, so if you don't want to use your brain, this isn't the gig for you."

133,2,Data Analyst role dressed up as Data Science,Data scientist,"- Work life balance is good and flexible working hours - Extra Christmas and summer company shutdowns (adds a few free days to your total holiday) - Good pension scheme (double contributions up to 10%) - Colleagues are generally nice (with a couple of notable exceptions at the manager level) - If you want a job where you won't learn or do much but want to have an easy 9-5 and get paid at the end of the month, PlayStation would be a good fit","- Work itself is more like a simple Data Analyst role but with the name Data Scientist, with little actual Data Science involved - Few learning and personal growth opportunities available - Slow moving and little innovation (due to company size, but also the kind of people who stay aren't ambitious due to the environment - the more driven employees leave) - A couple of the managers in the UK team are very inexperienced (and quite frankly, bad at their job) due to a couple of quick promotions to manager position and it shows - we recently had an anonymous department-wide survey (with lots of questions, but generally focussed on if you are happy in your job), and the Data Science team had the worst results in the department in which the team sits (of around ~10 other teams). I do see this as a manager-level issue (not director level - the director of the team is OK) - the managers seem to be out for their own gain and not for the gain of their direct reports"
134,1,Miserable Leadership / Terrible Work Life Balance,Manager,"A decent place to work if you're into games, but that's about it.","PlayStation (Sony) is a miserable place to work, and here is a non-exhaustive laundry list of why: 1.) Compensation: First off, compensation is weak and far from competitive with the market. My offer letter included no signing bonus, and there are no stock options for the vast majority of employees, even at the manager level. 2.) Work/Life Balance: Since the huge ""globalization"" effort, separation of work and life became impossible. I would wake up for 6 AM meetings and then take 10 PM meetings in the evening. Leadership did little to support a healthy work/life balance and would respond to people outside of working hours, expecting swift resolutions at odd hours of the day. When I was a Manager at Sony, someone on the Marketing Team took their own life. It took that tragedy for leadership to respond with resources and workshops for mental health. 3.) Out of Touch: Everyone director-level and up is a straight, white male that is insanely out of touch with the world at large and clueless to how other tech orgs of this size operate. As boomers, they feign a sense of care for DE&I initiatives, spew corporate poo poo words, and think that's enough to cover their butts. 4.) Cult-Like: If you're not into the industry, you are immediately ostracized like an outsider. Be ready to fake a passion for gaming or forever be an outsider to the cult. 5.) Org Hierarchy: The structure at Sony is extremely hierarchical, and employees are not empowered to make decisions. Instead, be prepared to be stifled for trying to innovate or implement change."

164,4,Overall good place to work,Software engineer ii,"1) WLB is off the charts great, IF you happen to find the right team. 2) Benefits were really nice! Free PS membership each year. Discounts on Sony products. 3) Probably depends on the team, but technology is progressive for the most part, and can be a good challenge. 4) Managers were emotionally very supportive.","1) The pay is lower than other companies 2) They don't allow fully remote, but do hybrid, depending on the bigger group you're in 3) Promotion is difficult, and some managers promote by the length of time you spend with that title. I saw other people around me get promoted without fulfilling the cultural requirements 4) HR is very slow to respond. 5) Some teams are definitely stretched thin, and could hire more so that deadlines can be met for dependencies."

169,1,Worst place to work,Anonymous employee,Free games and average benefits.,"Toxic environment with no career growth. Compensation way below market. Work hours all around the clock with teams in US, Japan & UK which leads to no work life balance. Things move very slow and projects take forever to launch.

247,3,Engineer,Software engineer,Fun place to work because you deal with PlayStation,Very uncompetitive pay because they use their name to pay you.

271,4,Way too much bureaucracy and process,Senior software engineer,"Rancho Bernardo office is beautiful. Employee cafeteria is on the 10th floor with a view to the ocean. Level 6, the Sony gym, is 100% subsidized and right on top of the parking garage, it's beautiful. In general the engineers are good to work with. Will pay for some people to go to offsite training, but the paperwork to get approval is outrageous. Fantastic relocation package. Decent profit sharing. (annual bonus)","Management won't allow upgrades of the technology even when it would benefit the bottom line. Up until this year they used C++98, a 21 year old compiler. (They moved to C++11) Claims to move projects to JAVA or at least micro services but never actually starts those projects. Sony back end services moved to AWS but won't allow teams to use the AWS suites without major reviews by ""architecture team."" Claims to have a sandbox area for engineers to experiment in, but it's so locked down nothing actually can run there. Low level management has no clue how to run a team. Mid level management spends 110% of their time in meetings. Upper management puts out great ""Dream of a new company"" speeches but doesn't move the company fast enough. Playstation 5 will be the last set top box and then the companies profit line is going to tank as cloud competitors eat their lunch. Says they don't do stack level ranking but they do. Performance reviews have almost noting to do with actual work performed."
272,5,PlayStation is a phenomenal place to work,Software it analyst,Great work culture with a strong outlook.,Career paths can take a long time to progress in.
273,4,Great if you're not focused on pay and ambition.,Global manager,Chilled out place to worked that supports remote working,Not the smartest people working here. Dated internal systems.
274,3,So much red tape I'm drowning,Systems engineer,Great team. Slowly building up collaboration and trying to build up proper infrastructure.,"Corporate IT Policies block production progress at every turn. There is a HUGE disconnect and lack of communication between departments. No one knows what anyone is working on, and not just in secret projects but in building up infrastructure. We need to be working on coming together and bridging the gap between IT and other departments. They either need to give up our own environment to properly manage or to learn to work closely together. They believe obscurity is security. All this does is put a black cloud of paranoia over all departments and causes major administrative overhead and time wasting."
275,5,Very good,Administrative assistant,Nice place to work. Enjoyed it,"Very fast pace, very busy."
276,2,Dull,Artist,-Sony PlayStation project titles as portfolio,-boring and dull task - soul crushing

Lots of great internal talks and KT sessions almost every week. Bi Annual Hackathons where interesting projects are made and productized. Some of these projects are already in the market.,"- lot of Politics creeping in recently. - Hiring is rarely quality driven but more quantity driven. get a feeling managers are Not confident of brining in quality candidates so try to hire people without feeling entirely convinced - Growing Too quickly and now is unable to look after The Career paths of The employees. also leading to quantity based hiring. - unable to move out or motivate poor performers leading to bad team morale within The various teams - Tokyo is The boss which no one Can question. Tokyo teams try to take over work from US teams in an effort to get more work to Tokyo. - poor communication and coordination among teams. information is rarely shared among sites/groups since there is a huge fear of taking over projects by other teams. - Above all else, The Pay is much below market rate."
280,5,"Great place to work, with plenty of opportunity to learn and grow",Lead operations analyst,"- Fun place to work - exciting new things happening all The time - Great opportunity to learn a range of skills within It, Testing, development, project management etc.","- ceiling of job roles at times, and guidance on what to path to take next"

283,3,Not a review of SCEA as a whole. I predict that the boat is sinking at the First Party Quality Assurance department.,Contingent game test analyst,"I've never worked with a bunch of better people before. Fun and relaxed job. Of course, this is limited to my peers and my direct supervisors. I am extremely skillful and consistently win praises from them. Unfortunately, Senior Management doesn't know who I am. More on that in Cons.","Hours have been cut dramatically over the past year. I would have repeatedly returned due to overtime. I'm a person who does overtime for the success of the project and due to team loyalty, not necessarily money. But, due to changes by Senior Management that is gone and the quality of testing has suffered dramatically. Senior Management is comprised of friends and gaming buddies. If you're not their buddy, don't expect to get a permanent position and you don't necessarily have to be a good tester at that. There are a lot of lazy and useless permanent employees because of this. In a word: Politics. Temporary employees do not get any of the perks that a permanent employee do. This includes: Medical, paid time off, free games, food, and employee discounts."
284,5,engineer,Game developer,I love it so much,I can play and share my ideas anytime.

286,5,Salary,Network administrator,You have nice people around you and its very good job.,For me the only problem is time because you work all day
287,3,Some highs some lows,Senior software engineer,"1. Very stable, consistently increasing business for the last 8 years 2. Many opportunities to work on something interesting 3. Working with a lot of nice and intelligent people","1. So so health plan: both wife and ex have a better plan than mine 2. Whomever wrote about the Intuit mafia in another comment here is right. 16 people got hired from Intuit in the last 6 months, and, it seems mostly for management positions. 3. Newer management in question doesn't really understand our business, and doesn't listen to old timers. They often act like they understand and know more about the platform than us. 4. Newer management makes a lot of ill conceived decisions that are discouraging real talents, thus increasing loss of tribal knowledge."
288,4,YOU CAN BE,Product manager,We at Playstation admire the workplace of engineers and coders etc,Ideas for games and easy coding experience needed
289,5,Wonderful Company,Regional manager,One of the best brands in the business,Globalizing the US market took 2 years. This was very unsettling.
290,1,Good Company Benefits. Poor Team.,Anonymous employee,"Decent Company Benefits
Free Games
Free Swags
Discounted Sony Products","Very Poor Management
Constant Bullying from certain peers. Felt like High-School."
291,3,Leadership is incredible and Management is terrible,Anonymous employee,"The leadership is fantastic. You will be hard pressed to find more visionary, likable and intelligent leader in your department. They have a clear vision of the future of the company, the possibilities and it's incredibly contagious. They will give you a lot of vigor to fulfill their dreams so that the customer is well taken care of. They're also not afraid of taking their own risks and trying new things (as long as it meets their superiors agenda). As much as they will deny it at PlayStation, a love of gaming is near required. Which is a pro if you have a affinity for games. A con if you are not.","Management is incredibly powerful and they keep that power for themselves. The simple fact is that you were hired for a job, and for that job only. While some companies hire for creativity, intellectuality, boldness. You are at PlayStation to fill your cog in the machine. Giving me the feeling of being a Temp / Contractor more than a Full Time Employee. For example, exploring other aspects of PlayStation (let alone Sony) is near impossible due to the dozens of security, management protocols and other walled garden approaches that the company has taken in order to enforce this. However, the leadership within PlayStation or those who have their ears, will enjoy pushing the boundaries of entertainment while taking advantage of PlayStations bright and friendly workforce. In summary, if you're looking for a company ready to invest their dime in you to take risks or explore in any facet of the word without being in a position of power, then you best look elsewhere."
292,2,Process Heavy and Politics,Product manager,- Cool brand - some teams are Fun - Cool initiatives in The pipeline,- Process driven company where change is slow - Lack of diversity (in all ways possible) - Politics between teams makes It difficult for newcomers to ramp up - work is done in silo and difficult to track owners
293,4,Good but not fulfilling enough,Senior software engineer,"Good compensation and great benefits, the company makes tons of cash so it's being very generous on annual bonuses, it even has a cash-equivalent Employee Stock Program. Significant annual increases pretty much guaranteed if you're a decent enough achiever, so even if you start average it can climb pretty quickly. Great morale, it helps to work on an industry leading console which blows records month after month. Awesome to be able to show people your work on your PS4 at home. Nice people overall, very laid back atmosphere, lots of video games and Japan enthusiasts. Good diversity and very respectful atmosphere among employees (no brogrammers)","A lot of mediocrity among engineers: some of them barely knew how to program, others would spend more time on social media than working, or even some more interested in running their own interests before their assignments. If you end up locked up in one of these teams, it's very hard to get out. Also lots of politics going on, way too much for me. I was also not a big fan of the widespread SAFE methodology and the over-reliance on tools like Rally which created lots of overhead. Working with Japan is interesting but also very frustrating at times, especially as they have ownership of the platform. Finally, very limited remote work options, given that most of the work requires devkits that can't be accessed outside the office."
294,3,"San Mateo is great, San Diego...Not so much",Anonymous employee,"I have been with the Company for almost 10 years now, and I can say that the benefits and perks that come with the job are great. We get paid holidays and yearly bonuses as well. The passion that the employees have here is great, and there are tons of creative people you get to work with.","As the title mentions, the San Mateo location seems to be a totally different company than it's San Diego counterpart. The culture in SD has not changed for years, and often employees are bringing up the same issues year after year. I love the Company as a whole but things need to change. Moving up in the Company is difficult unless you know the right people, and the poor performers stay around for way too long."

If you are here in person on time, that is all it is about. Best for hourly workers and watch dogs. Measure your performance by timing, not results. Very strange culture for software industry. You have to come to daily stand ups in person only. Micromanager does not time themselves though. ""It"" can come late and leave early as ""it"" wishes. Because ""it"" makes rules only for you. ""It"" is above the rules ""it"" makes. ""It"" can cancel or reschedule meetings at the last minute without any heads up although requiring you to give 24 hours notice to change a meeting. Because ""it"" ""owns"" the team including you. You are just a slave. ""It"" does not need to do real work. ""Its"" job is ----- watching you!!!!!"

Your kids will be impressed. :-) New leadership is driving badly needed change, including a better focus on availability and a transition to a new architecture to support the next stage of growth. Management brought it from Intuit (and elsewhere) over the past couple of years are very good.",The organization is recovering from years of poor leadership that has left a bloated and inefficient organization. Many of the bad reviews you are seeing on Glassdoor are from a minority of disgruntled employees who are unwilling or unable to adapt to needed change. It is no longer acceptable to be paid just to come to work which is a good thing in my book!

309,4,Good Place to work,Staff site reliability engineer,Very innovative Strong tech stack Supports Diversity Good culture,Security is eggregious Cross functional chaos too many acronyms meeting madness
310,2,"Fun atmosphere, but frequent layoffs",Anonymous employee,"There are a lot of great people and passionate gamers at PlayStation. There is also a lot going on and projects can change quickly, so if you thrive on rolling with the punches, you will be happy here. There is very little bench depth, so you also have to pull your own weight - but the people are willing to help and work a few extra hours so you can be successful.","Limited advancement opportunities and layoffs every 3-6 months. Employment is very unstable and management will not give you a heads up before you get a pink slip. In fact, we were told that no layoffs were being considered at a quarterly meeting by our SR. VP, yet 2 weeks later 50 positions were eliminated. Management is also pretty dishonest in general, and you can never get a feeling if the business is doing well or is in trouble. Finally, all the horror stories you hear about how people are ""let go"" in the gaming industry is very true at PlayStation - basically, your position was eliminated - give us your badge and get out."
311,3,"Good culture, not very competitive compensation",Senior brand manager,"Good culture, good people ad exciting products.",Does not have competitive salaries compared to other companies in the same area.
312,3,"Great place to be hired at, bad place to stay",Senior systems engineer,"Tons of openings, because all the long-timers are leaving; underpayment is the biggest single issue. Very competitive pay for new hires, which is the only way to get paid market rate here Excellent employee discounts Generally good benefits Very interested in diversity; diverse candidates should definitely apply - just don't stay long enough that your pay falls behind.","Zero effort to maintain current compensation for employees. Work/Life balance is a marketing blurb, not a commitment. They will tell you that you shouldn't work more than 8 hours a day and 5 days a week, and should use your vacation time, BUT will also hound you about maintaining deadlines which require 60+ hours a week to meet. Repeated statements that compensation will be brought current, but with NO follow through or broad correction, over a multiple year period. It's disingenuous at this point and the company is bleeding long-term talent because new-hire salaries are currently following market rates and going crazy, but no meaningful adjustment seems to be planned for existing employees. If you stay more than a few years, you'll see people hired in at your same job title making 10%-20% more money than you, just because the company does not value long term employees at all."
313,2,Don't be attracted by the name of the company.,Anonymous employee,"Less number of people, work is fun, not much pressure. Good for gamers or people who are ready to compromise ambition with leisure in their career. Few really good chaps work in there and its good to converse with them.","Do not expect anything in terms of growth if you are on a contract. Its peanuts. Process is not transparent. Feels like you are being mugged for your contribution tothe projects. Projects are scarce and learning is literally zero. The workplace does not contain the appeal and feel of a game testing lab and has more strict corporate feel to it. Canteen food is a real disappointment. Contracted employees are not made to be felt as a part of Sony, they are not involved in team outings. Ratio of contracted employee to permanent employee is 1:15 Dependent on other playstaion regional offices to get a project. No direct client interaction. You interact with a QA of other region who interacts with the developer, which results in non-transparent process and zero learning. Logistics are outdated and slow. Zero female employee, all males. The management does not take this department seriously and consider it just a time pass job."

315,5,Full Time SDE review,Software engineer,"After interning at two different offices over two years, I converted to full time. My time with Playstation Network has been good, both of my managers were cool in their own ways and the work was interesting. The San Diego office is more laid back and the San Francisco office is more like a standard hot tech company in the bay. Since I am going to be working fulltime in the bay I will give the Pros and cons of that office. Pros: - fun work environment, many avid gamers if you're into that kinda thing - Smart workers: all of the people I worked with knew what they were doing and were helpful, it's good to see that at a fairly new company. - Agile software development: The software development pace is quite quick which is great for rapid development and actually getting to see your changes in production. - The office is nice and in a good location to bart to. They are remodeling and adding some more entertainment like a new pool table.","- some times The work environment Can be stressful, but that is to be expected when working on PS4 features affecting millions of users"

In relation with other companies I have worked in past (Cisco, GE Healthcare, Symantec) - At heart of this company its still stone aged in terms of technologies used inside (e.g. Lotus Notes - I hate it - trust me you will. , very mediocre intranet, no internal chat or IM, ) - No co-operation from sister concerns like SNE and others. A lot of politics in terms of who own the project/data rather then making a impact for benefit of greater Sony."

It's absolutely dysfunctional and close minded. Old school top down micro management style that closely watches you when you come in, when you go to lunch, when you leave, even when you go to the restroom sometimes. I'm not kidding. I had the worst manager ever in my career. Super low eq. Nobody likes to work with my manager. Rigid thinking. Unappreciative. Arrogant with I'm always right you are always wrong attitude while my manager only understands 20 year old methodology and technology. Things have changed lately, especially in the valley. Good luck with your so called gospel of truth thinking. You won't comprehend how laser works. Just stick with your stones. Super political. A lot of incompetent and skill set outdated people in house trying to stay employed while hiding their incompetencies. If you are forward thinking and naively think you can change these people and environment? Good luck with that. Human beings just can't survive during Jurassic period because the dinosaurs are too big and too strong to eat you up before you can even discover fire. If you are on the non operation side, I heard life is at least more ""normal."""
332,2,"Great employees, horrible management",Anonymous employee,"Most engineers are smart, dedicated and want to build great products. Some ""Silicon Valley"" type perks. Very casual environment where having an adult beverage is OK.","Management is ruining what used to be a great company. The new leadership from Intuit has killed morale and is forcing out the aforementioned smart employees. They are bringing in sub par former colleagues who were forced out of their previous company and buying ""Enterprise solutions"" instead of letting the engineers build great things. Do you like working a full day, then supporting midnight maintenances only to come in a few hours later for another full day of work? How about working Christmas day in the office? Good, because both are required. Non technical people leading and making the technical decisions? I'm confused. Every decision has become only about money, which I partially understand from a business perspective but it wears people out. Although management wasn't around for the development of the PS4 and the supporting services they like to take credit for how the company is doing."

I look forward to coming to work everyday and enjoy the people, the environment and the scope of work. I was not sure about working for a company that was owned by a Japanese company, but that is not an issue. Instead, it is such a huge benefit because we have the autonomy to work independently, yet all the benefits of the support and funding from such a huge corporation. Every work area has a gaming station and you are encouraged to play during work hours! How crazy fun is that! Plus, having the opportunity to work so closely with the executive team, I am able to see clearly our mission and why what we do is important. Passionate people, phenomenal products and great benefits! Also, pay is great and the bonus program is killer, not to mentions the perks like deep discounts on ALL Sony products, matching 401K, generous medical and dental and the PTO and paid holidays makes it easy for work / life balance.","No real cons other than the commute is long -- but given the amenities, the gym opens at 6am, so you can come in early and workout and beat traffic and the coffee bar and cafe open at 7:30am - so everything you need!"

352,2,Uninspiring place to work where mediocrity is tolerated and excellence is discouraged,Senior software engineer,"The perks are nice. The work environment is extremely lax. Expectations are low and there is little accountability. Middle management is mostly clueless so it's very easy to slack off during the work day. You will never get fired. If you are writing a comedy series or a comic strip about indifferent workers and clueless managers, this job could be an excellent source of material.","It is an extremely political environment driven by insecurity and paranoia. If you can tolerate being in the right clique, you will do okay. You will also do okay if you are indifferent about work and are just there to collect a pay check. It is not the place to be if you are a high-achiever. You will be seen as a threat by middle management, lose what little autonomy and decision-making power you had, and get criticized when your less-capable peers complain about you refusing to do their jobs for them. Most of the high-achievers have already left so what remains are lazy ""lifers"" and the naive who do not know any better (do a search on the ""dead sea effect"")."

Lots of good management who are genuinely passionate about the business, have input in setting their own inspired goals, and are not just trying to meet quotas handed to them from above. Headquarters was recently moved to USA, making one of the cons that almost everyone mentions here a little less con-ish.","Working with the parent company in Japan can be frustrating (but maybe less-so moving forward). It's an older company with an established management hierarchy, so don't expect to join on the ground floor and then be able to move up the ladder quickly. The food court in the Foster City isn't especially good or cheap."

Cool discounts on PlayStation and SONY products.,"Depends on departments, but if someone ends up in a department where managers and majority of the workforce are in another country then US counterparts are seen with disdain and with open racism. No matter how talented you are, your contribution will never be credited as foreign and openly racist managers hate you. Career path is non existent and managers want to stick to old tech/tools/designs as much as possible. Anybody happy with using same tool/tech for several years with no aim for new thought but can run an operation day to day is rewarded more than anyone with newer and more practical experience. At company level the compensation is at the bottom tier compared to other similar SF Bay Area companies. No RSU/ stock based compensation or no effort to balance that with higher bonus."

If you possess talents, are good with people, take the initiative, and possess some measure of patience you can go very far.","It's not for everyone. Successful employees tend to put a lot of effort into decoding the large and complex org. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone who wasn't open to putting in at least two years of service before passing judgement - this place takes time, but the benefits can be worth the wait.

In less than a year, I watched 70% of my team leave. 2 top executives quit outright (giving no notice), leaving their positions unfilled until a year plus after. New middle and senior management has little to no experience in the space. The culture is becoming increasingly conservative, cliquey and less diverse as the parent company struggles financially. Said passionate and skilled workers were burned through, weren't recognized for their efforts, and left. Successful or innovative work is considered threatening and not rewarded. Not-rocking-the-boat is encouraged. Remaining and new employees are necessarily apathetic and mediocre in order to survive. Zero career growth paths. Strategy is often abandoned and teams are randomized due to pet projects and poor operational planning. Groundhog Day."

He attempted to relate and engage with you on a personable level and provide flexibility, support, and discretion for how you chose to pursue objectives, as well as feedback and resources for personal learning and development and encouragement to learn about different areas and departments of the company that might be of interest to you.","I did not feel there was a downside to working for the company itself. I had ample opportunity to learn the material and concepts that I was interested in even though they weren't directly part of my core tasks, as well as the opportunity to meet and learn from other industry workers who lent their experience and willingness to answer questions about the industry. The only issue that could have been improved was the occasional confusion over reporting of work hours as an intern, partly because they prefer you not to log hours overtime, and because new hire orientations can happen months to over a year after your start date."

There are a lot of perks working for Sony, including great benefits, movie premiers, hackathons, game tournaments, off-site team-building events, and discounts on products. Sony also has a great diversity program that's very friendly to women.","Any time you drive change, there are going to be some growing pains.

Rancho Bernardo office culture is Siloed and Stifling. Yes, the salary was good but it really wasn't about the money. I felt stuck and stifled. I had already been there for 3 years and I could no longer handle the obscurity of its culture, lack of direction and transparency. The workload was too high and the pressure was constant. Additionally, having a manager constantly breathing down your neck was disheartening. C-Level leadership based in this office lacks vision and strategy, as well as the fortitude and insight to do what's necessary to generate process improvement and forward momentum.

Yes, we are all locked in a room together to collaborate...feels like electing a pope where no one is getting out until we are done...only we have food, snacks, and breaks. They listen and make changes to improve our overall culture. Culture is pretty laid back. Facility is amazing. Benefits are improving. Great holiday parties.","No defined career paths for employees.

It's exciting and fun to know that you are part of something big.,The new untouchable upper management that was pulled in from intuit is ruining this company by striking fear in everyone and firing good employees. Mediocre VPs with no experience bring in directors of engineering who have never been an engineer just does not make any sense. It's hard to respect directors who acts with a brute force without even understanding the perspective of others. They completely threw away everything we have been working so hard on and come into the company demanding to rebuild everything for the sake of rebuilding. The moral is really low in the company and it kills any innovation because we have no freedom to innovate.
372,3,"They care for customers, not so sure about employees",Technical project manager,"Hands on with gaming consoles and games. The company strives hard to keep customers/gamers happy by keeping content fresh and introducing new technologies. Lots of talented and passionate employees work here. The ""cool"" factor about working at a gaming company, your family & friends flock towards you at parties/gatherings.","The gaming community as a whole are very spoiled customers compared to other industries. They get to whine and complain about the smallest details about games and consoles that will cause the Nintendos/Microsofts/Sonys to have knee-jerking reactions to their strategies and decisions. This often comes at a price of causing stress to employees in forms of constant team restructuring, projects being in constant flux, management changing directions, layoffs and OFFICE POLITICS. If you can't handle being thrown under the bus or not being sure whether people are talking $h!t behind your back, don't work here or at any gaming company!"
373,1,Not Bitter Just SAD,Character artist,Worked on many KICKASS games with some awesome people.,"Worked for the company as a ""Contract"" employee for 8 years. To get around the laws of California they would ""lay me off"" for a few months then have me back so they didn't have to pay for my benefits. I loved what I did but management refused to give reviews, pay raises or hire me on full-time even though the position was available and I had received a Masters Degree in the same field. That all isn't the worst. The worst was after 8 years they ""ghosted"" me. Basically, they told me they were going to lay me off for a few months, then when I contacted them repeatedly for when my start date was...NO RESPONSE. I thought these people were my friends ...The biggest slap in the face was my job was posted on their website 3 weeks later. ....Thanks Sony San Diego!"
374,5,"Great gamer culture, great growth opportunities, some shortcomings",Product manager,"- Great educational, medical and transportation perks - Great bonuses and employee discounts on PlayStation and Sony products - lots of opportunities to travel overseas, particularly to Tokyo or London - Supportive leadership that Lets employees explore different Career paths and grow - Passionate coworkers who love gaming and are really into what they are doing - a low-conflict environment with a Strong drive for consensus and respect - Agile development practices with continuous improvement, hackathons and quick adjustments based on lessons learned - work from home opportunities in The U.S. and management focused on Results, Not attendance - a quirky and creative environment typical of The gaming industry - a company that encourages playing games at work - a very approachable CEO and most other top leaders - lots of women in leadership positions, even in Japan (mostly up to Sr. Director level but also some VPs)","- Incompetence is sometimes tolerated indefinitely, true to the life-employment model of Japan - Managers frequently lack the most fundamental people management skills and don't know how to motivate their employees - Lack of open conflict leads to a lot of back-channeling, politics and having to read between the lines - In the Tokyo office, expectations about work hours are insane and no one can work from home, which leads to female workers still largely being forced to choose between having career success and being single, or having a decent but unimpressive job at PlayStation and having a family - The super-Agile style of the San Fransisco office frequently clashes with the Waterfall thinking of Tokyo - As of 2018, analytics is still not a big part of decision making and a lot of product managers are weak - Employee performance management is unpredictable and convoluted. There are no company-wide OKRs and it's hard to understand how performance goals are measured"
375,2,"Sometimes fun, but often a let down",Anonymous employee,"So many of the people are incredible and the products are really fun. The games, the people, the culture of play could make it into a terrific place to work... But","There's massive chaos right now on what the company will become. They've had three new CEOs in 18 months, and their Network still lags behind the competition. Overall, the company is in major upheaval, which is surprising and often creates some major confusion about where one fits. Companywide functions are really underpowered -- some are barely even paid attention to while others dominate. So often, stuff happens with in one function in a complete silo, and then it breaks across other groups."
376,3,Volatile environment with no respect for employees,Anonymous employee,"There are some very talented people at SNEI in San Diego who work hard to achieve results, believing in doing the right things. The business has challenging goals to achieve and they will likely succeed with proper attention to delivering experiences to beat their competitors. Salary is good and the onsite gym is great. Culture there is fast-paced but allows for company outings to get to know your colleague and just to have a good time.","The business is volatile and can be crushed easily by their competitors if not done correctly. The turn-over is high and I've seen people let go immediately with no notice and there's a hush-hush attitude about it. Work environment is fierce so you have to be careful whom you may disappoint or else management will easily let you go, I've seen it with my own eyes."
377,5,Wonderful place to work!,Anonymous employee,"SNEI is a great place to work. This division of Sony only started about 6-8 years ago, as opposed to SCEA which has been around a while. Anyway, because its new, you feel like it almost has a start-up feel to it even though its such a well-established company! People really care about your growth here, they want to hear your opinion and your input, and they are very smart people! They're also super down to earth. The quality of work is amazing you get to work on an entertainment platform - games, movies and music!! I definitely give it the highest rating!","There are always some negatives to a job (certain employees, processes' etc) but its all what you make of it. Its like taking the bad with the good, but generally I see everything is pretty great at this place"
378,4,Good place to work for but effective management is a bit lacking.,Anonymous employee,Working at PlayStation is pretty fun if you love video games. The work environment is laid-back in general. The company is not a stickler for when you get in or leave. People are pretty understanding if you need to leave early for personal reasons or need to take a few days off for vacation. The employees are nice and it's relatively easy to become close to the people you work with.,"In the time I've worked here, I've come to realize the company is not as organized as you hope it would be for such a big corporation. Communication is lacking and sometimes things aren't done effectively or on time because of this. I think this partly has to do with how many people are involved in one project. With so many people, there is a tendency for projects to lose focus because there is not one person or group taking ownership."
379,3,Lots of weekends!,Merchandising field representative,Anything that PlayStation makes you get for free! Very generous PTO policy. Company is closed between Christmas and New Years with pay. Cool products and great brand recognition. Merchandisers get to make their own schedule with some parameters.,Being a merchandiser used to be a fun job. You got to meet different people and every day was different. But now all we do is go to the same store every weekend and demo VR. My work life balance has gotten really bad. I work almost every weekend and I often work 8 days in a row or more because I am still expected to perform my normal duties along with the weekend work. I am getting burnt out.
380,1,"Good People, Terrible Management",Senior software engineer,- large-scale - really Great engineers - Weekly lunches - benefits,"- 25% of the advertised compensation was a yearly bonus. Don't be fooled. Depending on when you join it might be 1.5 years before you get it. - Also, if they decide you are not worth what they're paying, which base salary is already below average, they will string you along until just before bonus time and cut you with 0 days warning. - Also, and this is a first that I've ever heard of in the Bay Area, no severance whatsoever. Yes, none at all. Nothing. No 2 weeks pay, no warning, no here's rent money until you find something. Just, don't show up any more. - They work you like a start up but you have none of the creative input. - Management is incompetent and out of touch with the technologies and decisions. - Politics. A friend who spearheaded a major initiative to change the entire server deployment process, working day and night, did not get a promotion while the manager is taking all the credit."
381,2,"Used to be great, recently lost its way",Anonymous employee,"- The individual contributors are very good. They're smart, driven, and very easy-going. - The benefits and perks as part of the Sony family are great: Good health plans, huge discounts on sony products, free playstation games, etc. - Workers are encouraged to develop their skills by learning new tech and attending training and seminars. - Work / life balance is great. People are given flexibility as long as the work gets done. - Office culture is relaxed and casual.","- with one or two exceptions, middle management is Toxic, tribal, and self-serving. - Zero opportunity to move up in your Career - Pending merger with SIE is causing dread and rumors about job security, made worse by silence from Upper management. - office space is outdated and falling apart, management has no plans to do anything about it."
382,3,Used to be a good place to work.,Anonymous employee,"The people were good. Discount on Sony products. Occasional in-house happy hours. Ability to watch some movies pre-release. Without question, the company brand name was good.","Once the Sr Mgmt crew (all formerly from another well known company in the area) came in and took over things started to go downhill. The company used to support Scrum but started doing things that seemed to be very contrary to agile practices. The attitudes of the new ""leadership"" was very negative, at least towards existing SNE employees. They were better with the ones they brought in from their former company. This caused many to feel they were being adversarial."
383,1,Awful company with fake people,Operations analyst,Free games and that's it,"Everything, payment , management, work hours , yoh"
384,2,Independent place that lacks direction and vision,Anonymous employee,"Informal atmosphere, good benefits, good time off. People can be very friendly.","The company feels like it lacks direction. A great deal of bureaucracy strangles innovation. Company feels like it's loosing it's competitive edge in the age of online gaming. HR is a nightmare. No solid plan for advancement within the company. Company doesn't mentor. HR has no strategy in place to retain top talent. Pay is low. Talent is mediocre. Japanese style hierarchy and decision making structure is out of place in Silicon Valley. The company ""events"" have become an embarrassing joke (karaoke in the parking lot anyone?)."
385,1,Intuit Mafia is ruining SNEI,Anonymous employee,Sony has a good work/life balance. SNEI revenue is growing rapidly and should continue to do so for at least the next year or two. Most people working there who are not former Intuit employees are good people to work with.,"Over the last year a new executive in the San Diego office has been aggressively clearing out people and installing yes-people from Intuit. We're not just talking about clearing out people that perhaps needed to go, but clearing out anyone that asks questions. The entire atmosphere of innovation, collaboration, and desire to produce the best result for the company has been replaced with one that punishes innovation and enforces conformity and acquiescence over all else."
386,1,It's all a ploy for cheap labor,Intern,"Having PlayStation on your resume is cool, telling your friends about it is cool, and the free swag is cool.","Don't expect to be valued as an actual part of your team. I was often left with no projects and when I asked for more, my peers and manager would tell me they were busy and I couldn't help them. There was a lot of politics even from an intern level. Although the dress code is laid back, the culture in general is not. I saw many team members staying late to meet deadlines and could feel the stress in the air. Sony will tear you apart and does not value their employees. It also sucks because they offer a lot of contract roles and you never know what your status may be with that. Very little information was offered to me in my performance review and I was never told how I could improve or what could have gone better."
387,2,Toxic,Anonymous employee,"Working on PlayStation and being a part of the video game industry. The PlayStation ecosystem is always on the cutting edge, and the time I spent there was during the PS4 launch so it was doubly exciting. The passion and enthusiasm many of the employees have for what they're doing is unrivaled. It wasn't uncommon to find people who just loved what they did.","Management was terrible. The value of human resources was lost on many people, and the people in positions of power were too interested in saving face to make sure their workforce was being managed and treated properly. There were countless situations where management was aware of a terrible work environment but actively avoided the subject and did nothing to rectify the situation."
388,3,Good place to learn,Senior engineer,"Good place to learn, gain experience and make connections. The London office is in central London with a lot to do nearby, great restaurants and culture. You work for Playstation which people are generally know and interested about. You work with game studios and technologies that will be used in future games and media. The culture is inclusive, you will find many different looking faces here. There was no crunch and a pretty good work-life balance in my team.","Lot of company politics to deal with, secrecy and distrust between different teams. Lots of emails on the start of day and multiple meetings per day that are unproductive. Collaboration between different regions is sparse. Some internal systems that are being used are ancient. Salary is a joke, people working at Playstation are often living in house shares in London, and you will not be able to save up on an Engineer salary."
389,3,average company,Business operations manager,"I worked as Department Operations Manager. Average employee experience compared to other companies in the Bay area. HR people are nice and receptive but a mouthpiece for the Sr Directors and VPs- forget employee advocation! Nice HQ, good holiday parties. Good learning module on employee central. Legal people are also very collaborative and friendly. Good Pay and bonus.","Facilities workers are efficient but the managers are totally narcissistic. R&D department is run like a concentration camp. Have no idea how to efficiently manage people. Slave drivers rather than inspiring team to engage. Very Very hierarchical, political charged culture, employees with Japanese background are favored and not reprimanded- high level of Nepotism. Not at all entrepreneurial. Employees not promoted based on merit, but based on their national origin (or who they know)."
390,4,SCEA sucks,Anonymous employee,"Benefits, culture, free food and drinks, parties, my management is awesome (YMMV), opportunity to explore different things, some work from home, flexible hours, tons of paid time off.","Perks like holiday parties are declining, upper management cuts money on necessary small return items and spends liberally on unnecessary stuff; high turnover and onboarding of every single application anyone wants creates a lot of work and hemorrhages money, but they cut spending on office cleaning and other minor expenses. Merging of SCEA and SNEI has been appallingly inept and there has been little or no engagement of stakeholders for anything."
391,2,"Formerly a good workplace, now going down hill.",Anonymous employee,Discounts on the limited selection of first party games.,Pay isn't great when they're trying to compete and act like a tech company. Benefits are mediocre and don't compare to other companies in the area. Big distinction in work place benefits compared to their first party studios. No employee development or major support towards paying for education. Educational support is on the low end.
392,5,Best Place I've Worked to Date,Information security engineer,Sony Interactive Entertainment evolves and changes to improve not only innovations to become more profitable but I really feel like they care about their employees. They continue to improve processes and policies if they aren't successful. Fantastic benefits package Emphasis on work/life balance Great coworkers - lots to learn from others There is a sense of community to solving problems (lots of support from others) Wonderful company goals that are actually strived for,"At least in my department, meaningful self improvement training budget has been cut which is a bummer. As in many places, opportunities for advancement are limited but there is a balance to be met here between becoming too management heavy but I think SIE does a fair job of figuring that out. I really respect the executive team and believe they have a good vision for the company, however there are some middle managers that tend to play politics instead of focusing on improvements."
393,2,"Company with good perks, but the system is suffering from a lot of growing pains",Brand manager,Good perks if you are a gamer. Benefits package is alright. The company is an industry giant and has market leadership.,"The system is so entrenched in a kind of boys club attitude. Time spent in the company, deference to leaders, and maintaining the status quo are the main concerns. You will be thrown out if you do not move with the grain or if you question how things are done or try to think outside of the box. The way they treat contractors is embarrassing. Pay is much lower than a good majority of the Bay Area companies. The benefits package is alright, but there are no stock options. The company is still smarting from globalization and if you are on a global team, you can pretty much kiss your work-life balance goodbye."
394,1,Don't apply if you want to progress,Functional tester,Games given out to staff on launch date for free. Occasional raffle for freebies. Cake table at end of the month.,"Unless you're in a certain circle of people don't expect to get an interview for a promotion, even if you've worked hard at the company for years. People are promoted based on favouritism and not experience/skills which leads to some staff lacking in skills to manage a team. Certain seniors abuse their position and treat testers like children, some going so far as to bully staff and get them into trouble. If a person is favourited they can get away with pretty much anything, even if a higher up witnesses them doing something bad. Test floor gets super toxic whenever a new position gets announced and some staff don't hold back on saying what they think of others capabilities."
395,2,Sr. Designer,Senior designer,"Very nice campus. Good benefits. Nice cafeteria. Some fun perks like monthly $10 game vouchers and discounts on hardware. A week and a half shut down during the holidays which is good for full-time employees, but not contractors (which don't get paid).",Some inexperienced employees waste multiple team's time and energy by being reactive and flip-flop in their decision making. This wastes time and energy for multiple teams and is frustrating to be effected by inexperienced employees with too much power. Pay is below market rate and hours are inflexible (9am-6pm).
396,4,Cut your teeth,Cinematic animator,"Projects, people and location. You will be able to apply to a huge selection of studios if you spend a few years here.","Contract oriented, static pay, no upward mobility or broad knowledge learned. If you want to focus on the core of being a cinematic animator, you do that here. Get in some beach time while you are at it because you may not want to wait five years to move up the ladder or get a raise. It is a well known fact in the studio that you have to leave and come back to get a meaningful raise, and you might find yourself priced out of the studio with how competitive the rest of the industry is now."
397,2,Not a place for ambitious people,Engineer,"* Amazing product (PlayStation!!!) * If lucky, you get to work on very visible parts of the products * Get to try pretty cool games or tech (Morpheus) * Nice campus","* Work/life balance can be poor - a few people do all the work - others do the minimum * Don't even think about being a contractor there: you will be treated like garbage * All key decisions are made in Japan, no involvement of US people in the decisions * Impossible to have a relevant role or any ambition - dead end for your career * Low compensation compared to the rest of Silicon Valley * Management aware of all these problems - not doing anything about it."
398,5,work hard....have fun,Anonymous employee,"The culture here is pioneering. Not quite a startup anymore, rather an organization striving to grow. Not for everyone. People who excel here are ingenious, see around corners, have an “anything is possible” outlook, live for the mission, are cool to work with, possess tons of resilience and are really top in their craft. Personally, have a great boss, great team and super cool work to do. It's not by any stretch an easy job - but it's one where I make a difference every day and have fun doing it.",The org is behind in building out infrastructure and systems. Organizations have a lot of autonomy - but it also results in silos.
399,2,"Major Issues - Too Many 'Lifers', and Not Open to Change!",Anonymous employee,Decent benefits package Ok work/life balance Relative Flexible Schedule,- Employees that have been there a long time no longer have to prove themselves. Too many old fat cats. - New employees are held to a different standard. - There are double standard and unfairness in how employees are treated. Too many old 'cliques'. Somewhat like high school. - Communication from ANY management level is sorely missing. - Change is at a snail's pace.
400,3,Enjoyable at times yet taxing almost always,Anonymous employee,- I get to work with a product I've grown up with and love. - I get to work with some of the coolest people I've ever gotten to know. - The team you get really starts to become family after a while.,"- Favoritism is a huge issue here and the only ones promoted are those on the inside, not the qualified. - Management doesn't really disclose things that are pertinent to our job ahead of when we'll need the information. - We're often left blindsided by some of the issues that happen and our stats are used against us even if it's a new issue that we don't know how to resolve. - The turnover rate here is pretty high and good agents leave due to management's lack of transparency/flexibility or other stupid reasons."
401,5,Great place to work with exciting products touching millions of users,Senior manager - product management,"Once in Sony, you will have a hard time leaving, it is hard to beat when the products and services you are in charge of affects millions of people around the globe. Lot of opportunities to grow and at the same time enhance exciting products and services. Great and smart people. International culture and opportunities for working abroad.","Being part of a huge organization often also unfortunately mean slower in many aspects as there are more stakeholders and customers to consider and keep happy, which can be frustrating. Large old solutions that takes a lot of time to change and keep up to the changing market."
402,4,Very nice company with dedicated enthusiastic employees,Anonymous employee,"Company culture overall is great. All employees want to or think they are doing the right thing, very few really bad apples (tho some incompetence). People really are company's strongest asset. And of course PS4 is such a great product to be associated with. Business is booming and lots of excitement over new SIE formation.","Some employees need more guidance than they're getting. Still seems like poor performance (behaviours that are self-promoting rather than for the good of the business) is not sufficiently counseled to stop. Lots of valuable time wasted this way. Also, poor performers need to have good workers cover their poor performance, further setting the company behind."
403,3,A great industry somewhat undone by over-reliance (and staffing) at the senior management level,Finance,"Sony is a company with a rich brand history and this makes for an interesting work environment. The video game industry is still in growth mode, which creates an environment where contributions can be made at all levels (of course, provided that management allows for such contributions to be made). Entertainment is a integral part of people's lives and working for a company that develops entertainment product puts one ""front an center"" in this part of lifestyles. Benefits are reasonably good at Sony and the fact that many video game companies, including Sony Computer Entertainment America, are closed over the Christmas holidays is a nice perk.","Room for advancement is limited, particularly in certain functional areas. Japanese run leads to some complications when trying to address US or European markets."
404,4,Great company on the cusp of being Excellent,Anonymous employee,"The products we work on are amazing, innovating, and inspiring The benefits are great Lots of vacation time to decompress from working hard Having all the technology available to complete your work Management encourages initiative and responsibility, you're not just a cog","Growth opportunities can seem slower, not provided, or not communicated how to achieve. Sometimes someone from outside takes a position in which an internal promotion would have been a better fit. Trickle down of information lacking. There are lots of innovative, exciting things happening and new directions SNEI is moving, but this information sometimes doesn't trickle down. Try to bring those high level meetings back down to the employees."
405,4,Great benefits and salary,Anonymous,"The benefits and stability here are great, especially for a company in this field. And, this is from someone who was laid off. They are also one of the top game companies, when it comes to paying their full time employees a good salary.","Although their salaries are great, the raises aren't, even with top yearly review scores. Over the course of 6-7 years, I received a total 9% raise. The actual salary was still better than all other places, but in a better market, I probably would have looked elsewhere. #2 absolutely no career advancement opportunity. Everyone is pretty much locked in place."
406,4,Fun and challenging company with a bit of an addiction to managers.,Anonymous employee,"- Very laid back environment - Challenging work - Small, fast-moving teams - Get to work with and develop some extremely cool tech - Since being acquired by Sony, work hours have been reduced to ""normal"". - Lots of company sponsored events for the employees.","- Company is a bit ""top heavy"". It feels like every new person who gets hired is a manager or a manager or managers. Most of which, I am not even really sure what they do on a day to day. - The release process is a bit painful, but it is improving."
407,5,Good Company with a little too much management,Programmer,"- Incredible people (intelligent and creative) to work with - Amazing work/life balance. The occasional worked weekend is sometimes given back in lieue (worked two weekends in 5 years - one was returned). - Generally cool with semi flexible hours. 8:30-5, 9:30-6 or anything in between.","- some of The projects have a lot of management, and its Not really obvious what all of them do. - Legal is a joke. they do Not actively know what The requirements are for a lot of games, but tend to simply require The harshest restrictions possible. Advice: never suggest anything to legal. get them to return specific requirements."
408,4,"Fast, fun and exciting place to be. Working on the cutting edge and possibly changing an industry.",Anonymous employee,Everyone is great to work with. Most people are smart and hard working. Plenty of team building events throughout the year. Lots of little perks.,They will work you to the bone day in day out. Expected to work long hours. There is no real structure to projects. Most of the management have unrealistic time tables. Difficult to move up in the company. A bit understaffed. On the lower pay scale for this type of company. No appreciation of the hard work accomplished when going above and beyond the call of duty.
409,2,A place to kill your time but not to develop your career future,Software engineer,flexible working hours; every year there is a holiday shutdown between Christmas and New Years day... that's the only pros I can think of...,"too many/frequent changes at management level, senior managers/directors come and go, the working experience in the same company is not recognized by itself, incapable mid-senior management team, almost the entire DB department is called Indian team which implies its recruitment might not be a fair play, too many politics at all levels, you have career future here only if your manager likes you personally, work performance has nothing to do with it...salaries of same level engineers from different groups can be a huge difference...over the long term it's a sinking ship..."
410,3,good place to get a big name on your resume,Anonymous employee,"Friendly work environment Great company perks like happy hours, company events, holidays, etc. Great brand with a lot of pride in the work, work is extremely interesting and fun Company is doing well as a whole",Do not contract here - they treat contractors differently than they do FTE. There are no guarantees you will be hired once your contract is up Very political culture as is every big company - hard to move up in the company if you do not have the right 'relationships' Management only looks at success based on team as a whole - does not look at specific individuals (aka there are a lot of terrible managers that slip through loopholes)
411,3,Lucky that games are selling so well,Software engineer,"Good salaries, benefits, work/life balance. Exciting technical problems to be solved. Engineers work well together and have respect for each other.","You know if the company has to pay for a featured review to refute the other bad reviews and blame existing problems on past management (even though new management has been around for over two years) then there is probably a problem. Almost all middle level development managers (who have been there more than a few years) have left (or fired) because of contention with upper management. Development direction is based on good principals, but lacking in details and leadership."
412,3,"Great co-workers, zero career advancement",Marketing,"- The people at PlayStation are passionate about the products we're assigned to, and its apparent in our work. We are pushed hard to accomplish a lot with little time. - There are many resources from within the company to manifest outward facing communication. - on-site gym and cafeteria.","- we work so fast, that we forget about our own careers... and HR does Not seem to care. our goals for The fiscal year are written within The last two month of The year, rendering them meaningless. - Prerequisites for promotion are vague. when a straight answer is obtained from management, The Prerequisites change by The end of The year, making promotion impossible to achieve. some employees stay in The same position for a decade (or more) before promotion."
413,2,Crummy work environment - lack of inovation,Software engineer,Some of the coworkers are really great friends and companions and fun to be around. Great for people without experience to get a head start and move up in a corporate environment.,"Terrible work life balance, 40 hours a week is considered not enough by management, which as a programmer is pretty bad. Worked for months until 8 or 9 o'clock at night plus some weekends and was still reprimanded for not working 'hard enough'. Management would intentionally steer away from new technology and favor the old just to get products out faster. Constant unrealistic deadlines set by inexperienced managers who have no knowledge of software development themselves."
414,4,"Great opportunities to learn, grow, and keep healthy W/L balance!",Engineer,"Always exposed to new and interesting topics. Plenty of opportunities to grow and learn. And the work-life balance seems very healthy overall, with a few exceptions.","Although they've made a lot of progress in recent years, there really needs to be more coordination, communication, and better organization between all the many parts of Sony. It is very challenging to work with all the different parts of the company scattered all over the world. On the other hand, it certainly makes for plenty of fun work-related travel. This company definitely has the resources to make great things happen, but still lacks the coordination among all its disparate parts."
415,5,PlayStation Europe (London HQ) Great people and culture to work for,Group marketing manager,"Dynamic and exiting working culture which doesn't overwhelm or stress employees with tight and unreliable deadlines but it encourages creativity and innovation. Also it has recently started to substantially improve how PlayStation look after its employees with initiatives such as flexible working, new facilities including a gym, or session well-being related. People there are amazing and its a classic to pop down to the canteen on Thursdays or Fridays after work to have a drink and have a laugh with your colleagues.","Rather than a con it's more a challenge the company has come across due to its impressive and fast growth over the past years, specially since PS4 launch, which has made that the company structure and some behavioural process are still catching up with that fast growth."
416,4,I enjoyed 6 of my 7 years,Anonymous employee,"Decent workspaces, new computer every couple of years, flexible hours, on-site health club and cafe, most of the employees are smart and motivated to make the best product possible.",The recent management shakeup has been driving people out of the company by telling them that everything they've done for the last 7 years is crap and it all needs to be redone. Not the way to inspire loyalty.
417,2,"Leadeship heavy, powerless engineers",Senior software engineer,- Pay is OK - bonus is Above average - socials and PlayStation consoles available if you find time to play,"- leadership heavy, powerless managers of all kinds for a single project - department Director gets The final say on every Small decision - be prepared to work Late shifts and holidays supporting production even for SW Engineering positions - people being hired (previous coworkers) without proper interview and causing lots of issues - Horrible HR tools"
418,2,"SNEIntuit ""Leadership"" is Proof of ""Be Careful What You Wish For""",Software engineering,"The overall PlayStation product line and offerings are something the employees are proud of. The engineers and the line managers are hard working and competent. The grassroots attempts of perks and innovation programs are cool. Just not fully supported by upper management. Job security and overall company performance is positive. As is the work/life balance flexibility. There are times when we need to work off hours and off holidays, but the flexibility of daily activities makes up for it.","2 years ago, there was a leadership void in San Diego. The solution was transplanting Intuit employees up a ladder rung across the board atop SNEI employees. However, the leadership above line managers are not new leaders, but simply new managers. All Intuit employees coming to SNEI for promotions in your career beware, your ""contributions"" are not completely welcomed. Simply assuming you know best without asking questions or listening to feedback is an ignorant approach to management. Force feeding architecture and projects and getting acquiescence is not a sign of agreement but simply a sign of fear and sense of hopelessness. There is no trust. Some of the new regime are decent human beings, but others are simply egotistical, arrogant, micromanaging, over their heads, inexperienced, and disconnected from human interactions outside their circle of trust. All of this goes without saying that career movement opportunities is non-existent unless you break into the circle of trust."
419,2,"Great Brand, Great People, Poor Management",Anonymous employee,One of the coolest brands in the world and amazing products with a healthy financial outlook. Great people and working culture in EU.,"Middle Aged White Men's club. A lot of management have been there more than 10 years and lacking diversity in both management style and ideas. How well you get on with your seniors more important than your output. Literally no performance management, have many examples of people coasting for years doing nothing. Trying to be a global company but nowhere near in terms of organising themselves wasting loads of resources and time. IT services in Europe stuck in 90s (example migrated from Lotus Notes to Outlook only 3 years ago!)"
420,2,Burnout Culture and Bad for Women,Anonymous employee,"PlayStation is a great place to work for anyone who wants to make a serious career in the gaming industry. Having PlayStation on your resume opens a lot of doors. You should also consider PlayStation if you prefer an indirect conflict resolution style because the company culture discourages open confrontation and disagreement. A lot of alignment is done through back channels. Lastly, PlayStation is a good place for anyone interested in the Japanese language or culture. Japanese is used for product development discussions on a daily basis and the corporate culture is similar to what you see at big corporations in Tokyo. There are also frequent business trips to Japan (outside of the COVID pandemic).","- Burnout Culture At PlayStation, you'll have unnecessary meetings until 8 or 9 pm three or more times a week, without anyone asking if you have small children, or what exactly your children are doing while you are stuck in unplanned video conferences. None of these meetings are useful or necessary. Most of them never even needed to be an email. They are tedious status updates that go on for 2 hours and suck the spirit out of everyone. 10 or 14-hour work days are common, and no one knows why or what for. Nothing is automated, everything is in Google sheets or 60 Slack channels. Everything is always on fire and not being available is unacceptable. Vacations don't belong to you either, and your manager will pull you into meetings during vacation time too. PlayStation seems to have imported the concept of ""karoshi"" (death from overwork"") from Tokyo into Silicon Valley. - Terrible for Women As a woman at PlayStation, please prepare yourself to have supbar maternity benefits, the least desirable projects and performance reviews filled with gender-biased language. All of the most important product development always goes to the bro-culture dudes and there is a general lack of opportunity for women. Men always talk over women in meetings and no one ever stops them. Men also attack women when they are not available for meetings due to childcare conflicts or during no-meeting hours. PlayStation isn't at all interested in supporting mothers. That said, to create an appearance of caring for womens' issues, PlayStation has a number token womens' initiatives, except they are run by men and do exactly nothing to empower PlayStation women. During the COVID pandemic, PlayStation women were hit especially hard. Managers asked mothers to take paid vacation days to support their kids' virtual school. The CEO was extremely tone-deaf and kept sending messages about his sports interests and his barbeque parties as PlayStation women came together to cry because the loss of childcare was ruining their lives and their company didn't care. A lot of the company gender discrimination seems to be based on covert patterns of gaslighting. Not promoted or empowered? It's because you are incompetent, not because you are a woman (never mind statistical data). The company has consistently refused to release gender-based pay data. If you are a woman, just say no to this company. - Horrifyingly Bad People Managers. If you haven't had your share of bullying, yelling, humiliation and continuous put-downs, PlayStation is the company for you. Old-time individual contributors get promoted to people managers and then there is no one to keep their abusive behavior in check. If you are unhappy, please prepare yourself to accept a severance package because HR will never believe you or take you seriously. - Biggest and worst of all, PlayStation leadership is incompetent and runs the company on their gut alone, while serious players come into the gaming space with analytics and data-driven insights. PlayStation is stuck in trusting its long-time ""bros"" and their gut feelings. PlayStation will go the way of Blackberry unless it wakes up."
421,2,Good people - bad senior management,Anonymous employee,People are nice and helpful. The brand is great and the overall vibe is good.,"Senior management is like and old men club. Really old school. You need to be friends with senior management and flatter them to get noticed or to make any career progress. Also, there are so many layers of management that it is almost impossible to change processes of get things properly done or sorted, and by the time these are looked into, you are just indifferent. Everything takes for ever. From a manager to look at a small request, to making important tools or software available to you. Ultimately, there is no accountability whatsoever, so it is really easy to get unmotivated after little time. Arrogant attitude towards partners ... Fun place to work but for one year max."
422,3,Nice place for a young person......but then move on.,Manager,Free t-shirts and games. Decent pay.,"Nepotism + favoritism + ageism + blind faith  dysfunction. After making record profits in 2018, Sony Interactive Entertainment (also known as PlayStation) laid off a bunch of talented hardworking people a year later. Do you really want to work for a company that acts like that ? I heard Facebook and Google are hiring…. Sony is just another stupid corporation, and it is top-heavy with executives and directors. Like any other corporation, they treat staff unfairly, as there is a culture of nepotism, favoritism, ageism, and blind faith. Many older employees have been pushed out since 2015. Problems fester for years because the overpaid execs are too lazy to actually care. I was at Sony for 10+ years and I saw many smart, experienced people lose their jobs. Sony has a history of dumping smart, talented people. Their constant use of temp staff is extremely unethical. Sony has improved a little over the years, but it still has the common corporate problems: age discrimination, negative and chaotic management, lack of direction, lack of planning; lack of work-life balance. SONY Interactive is a nice place to work when you are young and need experience. But it's best to move on ASAP and get a job at Google, NVIDIA, Facebook, or Apple instead. Don't bother waiting for a promotion, because for many people it will never come.….You're better off jumping ship and going to some other company. Maybe in twenty years they will figure out how to grow up and be a smart company. All the free popcorn and t-shirts won't make up for the bad karma Sony has earned. Even when they make huge profits, much of that money gets sucked back to Sony headquarters in Tokyo, so your raise and bonus is not as great as it should be.Sony is still suffering from bad decisions that were made back in 2006 by upper management. Directors don't listen to staff, and they don't take time to communicate to the staff. Petty and passive-agressive behavior is standard among upper management. Sony is still having growing pains."

What they did not say is that this will be an auto-renewal subscription. After 1 year employees have been charged $49.99 for the PS Plus renewal (BTW PS Plus really sucks), and If you request a refund of your money you have to wait 2 months. The company literally calls this refund a "" Gesture of Goodwill."" Like if it is coming from a higher power. This is how this company cares about its customers (its employees), they simply don't. They are in business to make money, they care less about your experience as a customer or employee."

Most of the work you will do will never make it to market. Directions change faster than products are developed.

Ex-Intuit leadership uses bullying, intimidation, and public humiliation to strongarm people into their ways. Japanese culture is typical hierarchical, micromanagement, imitation of your superiors, rule following, and don't color outside the lines to command and control the staff. The result is there is no leadership at Sony because the focus is all on managing down to control the Engineers and tell them how to do their job. To add, since the Japanese culture is robotic and lacks human empathy, they do not understand or recognize the criticality of soft skills and human interaction in business leadership, so tend to make poor business decisions and hiring decisions."

At the same time, the existing senior Sony people have been squeezed out, quietly encouraged to leave, or just fired. No one from the original Sony Network San Diego in any position of responsibility and no one from the original Sony days has been promoted. There have been many new senior level positions filled, but none from within the company. Some have been given new titles, but no real promotions. Existing engineers have not been allowed to participate in the technical direction of the network. They are seen as hindrances and not as contributors.

459,2,"Good company philosophy -- poorly vetted, hostile management",Anonymous employee,"Many good people in the organization from diverse backgrounds; on-premises health club and cafe; hot food is available almost all day. Easy parking, safe work location.","Where do I begin? The hostility in this place is rampant. It exists at all levels, including the administration. Legacy employees live in silos and treat new employees with utter disdain. On the platform engineering side, the formerly-Intuit management solution to growth is to stack layers and layers of management between themselves and the worker bees. This is offset somewhat by the Japanese philosophy of owning the outcome - they force managers to rotate on-call; eating their own dog-food, so to speak. Instead of studying and refining current tools and processes, they create a new management position to address a shortcoming. Right now I have four managers between myself and a director. We have three engineers and one manager in my group. That's one manager for three people! Forget about fair consideration for a job. Some managers post jobs only as a necessary requirement, but could care less about outside candidates. I've seen highly qualified candidates completely overlooked because the hiring manager wanted to give that job to an old colleague or friend. If outside applicants had any idea, they probably wouldn't apply. Why should they? They'll likely get other offers before Sony gives them a chance. I can go on and on, -- the micro-managing, the meaningless gestures of generosity, the lack of coordination and standardization, etc., but I won't. But let me say this... if you apply at the Sony Taleo web site, and someday you get an email from Sony, be wary. The only reason why they would seem eager to hire anyone is to fill in a position that is badly understaffed. You'll get quickly hired thrown right into the fire, without even a semblance of proper guidance. Then what? Before you know it, you're stuck in a lousy job. And don't let them offer you a bonus with your salary negotiations. It's totally bogus. Unless you work 12 hour days and weekends and nights, you won't see squat for a bonus. I paid in blood, sweat and tears for this company, working weekends and nights and early mornings, only to be ""rewarded"" with a bonus that was a fraction of what was due. Sony pays out very little in bonuses even though the platform is making almost $8 billion this year alone! Over 1000 people work their butts off at SNEI to guarantee this 24/7/365 revenue stream for Sony, and for them to turn around and pay out a tiny fraction as a bonus is beyond insulting. It's a slap in the face. Don't waste your time with Sony Network Entertainment. Between the hostility, layers and layers of inept management, long, long hours and sheisty bonus payouts, there's very little reason to want to join this company. Which is too bad because I find the Japanese principals I work with --nationals from Japan-- to be wonderful people with honest and kind intentions. They're polite, generous, understanding, forgiving to a reasonable degree, and eager to come up with cool stuff, like the Playstation Network. It's the middle and upper management from the US and elsewhere that are ruining things for SNEI. This could be a much strong and more profitable company if it weren't for these management problems."
460,4,Senior Program Manager,Senior program manager,"The people, the technology, the environment, the cool factor of working at PlayStation, the fact that you work at a company that has customers who are not just customers they are fans! The executives are actually really cool people who do not sit on a pedestal. In fact, all of the management team and all of the individual contributors are genuinely sincere people who really care about the product and that's an amazing thing. The VPs and SVPs are incredible, approachable, knowledgeable, thoughtful and caring about the fans first. They practice what they preach for sure when it comes to being the best place to play (and work!) It's really an incredible place to work for so many reasons. The benefits and the perks and everything, I won't even describe because they're what you would expect… Simply amazing. It is definitely the coolest place I've ever worked and that's a high bar. There are so many great things to say about this company that I would probably spend the next hour writing them but I don't know if anyone would ever read all the amazing things I could say.","No clue how they ever delivered any product in the 20+ years before I got there. The process, or processes, are a total mess. No one business unit has any of the same or even similar processes - even with in the same business unit. Remember now, I am giving a four star review here because it is truly a pleasure to work there. It would be a 5 Star review....But, there are some serious deficiencies in how the company operates that have been solved at software and hardware companies years and years ago. Generally speaking, there aren't many egos to deal with but, there are a few and most of those come from the newer individual contributors, not the management team. Thankfully for the customers, a.k.a. fans, they make billions of dollars and can afford to make billions of mistakes and still deliver consistently. It's a crazy mystery I'll never understand but it does actually work I guess. The fact that no one knows who does what is the biggest challenge. Figuring out what people do in the company, because no one actually seems to know and I'm talking about people who have been there for years and years is amazingly difficult. AMAZINGLY DIFFICULT."

Eagerness on the part of management for associates to take on new roles and step into the green field.","A few too many ""Chefs"" created blurred roles at the top of the house. Long hours due to the start-up nature of the company. Limited budgets created the temptation to build solutions that they might be able to otherwise buy to shorten cycle times and deploy a better solution."

The health and medical benefits were outstanding. Schedule was quite relaxed, so a good work/life balance was possible.","Things moved slowly. Even though there was no dress code, in certain business units there was the feeling you were judged by appearance. Gossip and politics weren't out of control, but they were definitely there."

Some of the smartest people I've known.","Some groups have been growing, which is good, but new hires in the last couple years at the director level have been poor at best.

Too slow to invest on employee quality."
466,3,"Great place to work at a local level, difficult as you start dealing with the broader organization",Anonymous employee,Smart people driven to deliver. It's a fun place to work and spend your day. Compensation is also in the appropriate range so it's a nice gig.,Lack of strong vision and decision making makes for challenging projects and nebulous goals. Many areas could be exploited it we moved aggressively with purpose. Instead we seem to meander into our destination and it's frequently not as good a solution as we could have had with strong leadership.
467,1,"Toxic work culture, horrible management",Software engineer,"- very Talented, capable people - tasks are Challenging, Good place to learn for a short time","- Terrible micromanagement - people are overworked; the Japanese work culture requires you to stay in the office longer than that is usual in the American work culture - everybody keeps a lot of distance, people don't usually talk to each other; they go to the office, work and go home; period - compensation varies widely based on who is the closest to the management - management has the technical abilities to lead, however completely lacks people management skills - no career opportunities; career development completely depends on friendship with the management - the HR is incompetent Avoid at all cost."
468,4,Terrific Product with Siloed Employees,Consumer service,"There is no more passionate group of collaborators about PlayStation who take ownership of issues and share solutions with team members. Management gives individual contributors the autonomy to identify, present a solution, deploy and manage programs.","Bandwidth is stretched tight as there is always more work than there are teammates. As there is no PMO, it is common to deploy projects with insufficient testing with an assumption the issues would be fixed later. The benefit package is good, but pay is below industry average."

Exciting industry (video games and entertainment), with exciting products. Fair salaries, bonus, and even severance. Strong market share after launching PlayStation 4.","Heavily contracting staff in World Wide Studios (WWS), many teams are now half their original size. Executive leadership is not always strategic, and decisions are made slowly. Accountability is poorly maintained in most organizations, and often is culturally set by specific leaders throughout the various groups. Many folks are coasting (which impacts high-potentials/strong performers and team success potential); most global teams are silo'd, and employees are less of a priority/focus and poorly celebrated (besides shallow perks like free and discounted games)."

472,4,Good place to work but pay not great,Anonymous employee,Sony is a good place to work however things can move very slowly as management seem reluctant to make decisions,"Things can sometimes move very slowly, and there can be lots of red tape. The worst thing is the pay is way below industry standards. There are also lots of little clicks if your not in your out."

475,2,"Be ready to deal with excessive levels of management and red tape, all for wages which are far below industry standards.",Software engineer in test,"Good offices, good location. Great projects to work on that genuinely have an impact on many many people. Other engineers can be great to work with.","Salary Biggest con about this company is the salaries they pay. In general they will greatly underpay it's employees because they are working for 'Sony'. And, as HR and many managers will phrase it, that privilege equates to lesser pay. It can take years of bonuses and wage increments for ones yearly pay to match what you'd get elsewhere in the same industry at far, far smaller organisations. This is particularly true for mid-level/senior engineers and employees in the lower levels of the archaic hierarchy who have little management influence in their day-to-day roles. Good pay if your a manager though. Management/Culture This is arguably what destroys employee dissatisfaction most within the organisation/department. Even more so within its own R&D department. This is entirely dependent on who your manager is, so this particular negative applies to my own department and some of the teams I worked with rather than the whole organisation. Management is filled with stagnated and decade-old middle managers (and in my particular case) who did very little to no actual work outside of organizing meetings and providing already-clear direction. Little to absolutely no room for personal growth. My own manager implemented absurdly authoritarian-like methods and checks to ensure engineers were hitting targets and not missing deadlines (e.g filling out detailed excel 'time-sheets' submitted weekly). Managers are never questioned as it is believed their experience equates to infallibility, and when problems do arise blame is quickly shifted beneath them when possible, or otherwise ignored and hushed when fingers cannot be easily pointed down the assembly line. This fostered an environment within engineering teams where we had to constantly proclaim and prove what we were doing. Animosity easily developed between co-workers new or old because of this and would quickly look for excuses or throw others under the bus to shift accountability. E.g: Managment: You reported in the time sheet you coded X feature, which took you Y hours, and Z lines of code (yes they count lines of code). This is bad it should have only taken you minimum X-6 hours (arbitrary estimation with little consideration of actual engineering challenges). Why are you under-performing? Person: I did what I could under the restrictions of teammate A not doing Task Con time, also blame this tool was broken and XYZ teams did not communicate and deliver, etc etc. I hope things have changed since I left because in particular one team at SCEE R&D has extremely high employee turnover for many years. Yet everyone seemed to casually ignore that perhaps the all-wise manager running the team and their methods were the actual cause of engineers leaving every 1-2 years."
476,3,"good company to get experience in, growth industry",Senior developer,"good for resume. experience in the gaming industry. The company has grown very fast so intercommunications are a little slow and organizational stuff is hard to organize. It takes a lot of time to get projects approved, and sometimes they get killled - i guess all big companies are similar.","big company downsides, nothing unsual. Too many discussions with all company branches, a lot of time wated on talking about projects instead of just doing them. Sony's different companies don't talk to each other a lot, this is improving a lot in the last 2 years, and might make sony a much better place to work in."
477,3,Interesting 4 years,Program specialist,"There are great health benefits, great relationships, great environment, easy going","There are lots of groups that don't know what they are doing.

Management is not always clear and open with the direction of the company and how that impacts current employees.
479,5,Great studio to work at,Character animator,"At Bend Studio, you work with some of the most talented people in the industry. Everyone is extremely motivated to produce their best work possible. They really push the limits as to what can and can't be done. If you're an outdoorsy person, the location is a huge plus. Plenty of hiking, mountain biking, camping minutes from the city limits. And if the snow's good, Mt Bachelor's only a 20-30 min drive.","It's the only entertainment company in Bend. So if by chance you end up looking for other work, you'll have to head north to Portland or Seattle, or obviously South towards the Bay Area or Socal."
480,2,Every man for himself,Anonymous employee,"Work on games enjoyed by millions of people. Flexible hours and attire (like holy Australian Nightmare you wouldn't believe the way we dress for work). Excellent facilities with numerous amenities (gym, pool, aerobics, etc.)","Our culture is heavily siloed and relies on ad-hoc individual contributions. There is a very need-to-know culture of secrecy around almost everything. I don't think anyone has spent any time developing and promoting wholesome institutional habits. So, everything falls on the shoulders of individuals and when they leave that bit of institutional knowledge inevitably goes with them."
481,2,Business is Business at Employees expense,Consumer service representative,"Good while it lasts, finally got 8 hours off every month PTO only to get laid off.","Employees are tools, that is all. Local Management more so. Jobs posted should have been filled long ago but no one is qualified to hire so they fall back on Temps or worse Interns. Business suffers and politics says all is well until the next lay off hits. Walked out whole Department midday, not allowed to say goodbye or get a soda. They do Fed-Ex your personal property at least."
482,1,"Negative, stressful, unorganized environment",Anonymous employee,"The food, coffee, and special events.","Senior management is negative and puts others down as if it's a game. This demeaning attitude is also reflected in people who work closely with management. You're constantly criticized by others and never given support/encouragement. This was a regular complaint I heard from peers. You would constantly hear employees in Procurement and Project Management complaining about how stressed they were. The managers are incompetent and promoted without any experience in their field, with bunk degrees (DeVry, Phoenix, etc.). They also hire family members without experience in their field. This makes it difficult for anyone with actual qualifications to work effectively and make improvements. Many employees are incompetent and don't reply to emails or phone calls."
483,2,A great company with way too much drama,Senior software engineer,"Great business model/framework, reasonable workload.",Drama drama drama: Ever changing upper management and shuffle around people at regular basis; A few groupies that hard to work with or talk with; Incompetent middle management walk around like HR nightmares....
484,5,Amazing intern program!,Software engineer intern,"- I've interned for three other companies, and the PlayStation one was by far the best - Intern and company events are very fun - Learning new technologies outside of class with smart people - Amazing perks - Treated as a full time employee - Growing company with lots of opportunities",- This year's response times to possible full time conversion were slower but was mainly due to the merge - Communication with students who were graduating in the immediate future while they wait for a response would have been appreciated
485,5,The Best Job I Ever Had,Retail sales associate,"I was a technical documentation manager and website producer - working with all of Sony's Playstation Studios around the world. Travelled to visit studios in the US, in Europe, and in Japan. I developed media and themes for Sony's internal developer conference, and managed posting conference sessions on the internal website for studios to share. Best job of my career - my boss gave me freedom to define my role as I thought it should be done.",All big companies have a fundamental flaw: lack of coordination among various disbursed groups. I learned to live with that in my 30+ year career in software development.
486,3,Good Hang,Marketing,"Atmosphere is low stress, people are great and the comp is decent. Most senior management are Sony lifers and not very brilliant or inspirational. If you like to game and be part of the industry you'll get some great perks in marketing, sales or development.",Senior managers are yes men and will do anything to keep their cushy positions. The top management is a full time internal PR machine.
487,1,Worst job experience ever,Anonymous employee,"Apart from global brand recognition...there are no pros to working here. Oh wait...discounts on video games, that was cool...better if they were free though!","-Senior management that is not only incompetent, but insane. They seem to pick their sr mgt based on: nepotism, BS skills, or whoever can manage to wait it out there.....15+ years. Imagine that! -No real career advancement path. -Complete lack of communication from Japan about company changes, product development...their employees find out from the media."

489,2,It's not a culture for everyone,Software engineer,"Benefits are great as far as San Diego employers go. They try to compete with Silicon Valley companies on this front. Pay is generous for the area, as far as I can tell. They are definitely willing to pay out for talent. There's a nice cafeteria on the 11th floor, where you can occasionally get an ocean view. There are also many fun activities for employees throughout the year: take your child to work day, happy hours, nice holiday party, video games, off campus events, etc.","Much of this is probably dependent on the team you are a part of. In fact that itself is a major con. The teams are generally very siloed. There is not a lot of communication across teams on the individual contributor level. The management style is very top-down. They pretend to be agile by implementing SAFe, but SAFe is a little too structured and too pre-planned to really be considered agile. The company is very inefficient. Most of the teams at the San Diego location are there to support infrastructure in some form or fashion, but yet there are always outages. The company would do well to outsource the infrastructure support and hosting to a vendor and focus on developing services. There are also cultural inefficiencies. For those that are unlucky enough to have a team with mostly Japanese management, you had better learn Japanese or else you can expect not to be included in any of the decision making process. There is an obvious divide in business culture: Japanese and everyone else. They do a lot to take care of employees (see the pros) but the management style and the inefficiencies just make you not care to try. There is such a culture of mediocrity, and so much of the work seems like work for the sake of work. If you are close to retirement age and looking for a place to just coast for the last few years, there is probably a position here where you can give minimal effort and not get a lot of grief for it."
490,2,Low $$ and toxic management not worth the Fun Culture and Great staff.,Anonymous employee,"Fun Culture, Great People , MD who was passionate about the Brand. Social events and incentives + benefits great. Sales Team leadership was great.","Salary not competitive, OLD systems and technology, No direction from direct management, MD who lived and breathed the brand and cared about everyone was let go after launching the business 20+ years ago. Heartless. Collaboration between departments is not encouraged. Absolute boys club, no female managers. My manager would pile work on top of me even though i was struggling and concerns were laughed off."
491,3,Heavy bureaucracy and office politics,Software engineer,Plenty of company vacation days; Discounted company products,Boys club; Luck is essential to have career growth here; Top-down performance review only - manager has unlimited power; Highly UNcompetitive in salary and bonus; No stock option; Some team encourages bad work-life-balance; Lots of bureaucracy and office politics
492,2,"My experience, and for a few others",Qa functional tester,A gateway into other more permanent opportunities. Certainly gave me the power to seek something else after my experience. I made a few nice friends there.,"Toxic Environment, Poor Training, Favouritism, Lack of Opportunities. People are toxic to one another and step over each other for permanent positions. God forbid you actually get an interview, if youre not liked even with a lot of experience and knowledge, you wont be getting the job. Myself and a few other colleagues experienced the poor treatment to a few of us. This usually happened when they were thinking about letting us go just before our 2 years of service under the Yoh contract. Please get rid of agencies and begin to hire your QA staff permanently. The place is too toxic with everyone too scared to be let go, and so resort to trying to obtain a permanent position in any way that they can. Even if they try, if they arent very popular or dont live in Liverpool you can bet 100% theyll be ignored. Even if theyre hardworking. Seniors do more than the managers, or so thats how it appeared to me. People always left continously due to feeling underappreciated especially since the start of the pandemic. Where are the thank yous, gifts, and free PS5s which you gave to permanent Sony staff but not Yoh? Oh yes, and half-days, sick pay. Yoh get none of it, just 10p soda cans and a free game once a year. Its not enough for all the hours and effort we put in for you. Theyll get rid of you if you arent pulling your weight, or if you are will move you from title to title with no explanation making the experience harder. Great for CV, but not for work relationships and a sense of overall purpose there. Expect your colleagues to treat you as someone under them; acting like your boss. These are usually the ones who are trying to become a senior and unfortunately it always works. Theyll be horrible and get thanked for it. Like huh? Oh, I had 1 performance review from Yoh after 2 years and it lasted 10 minutes. Thats all I get? Thankfully I handed in my notice whilst being accepted into a studio, and I couldnt be more happier. The new place is much more welcoming, and actually cares about my progress. So please, if youre under a temporary contract treat it as temporary and dont attempt to stay. Unless you have old friends there, which a lot of them did. Filling the whole place with nepotism. If you live outside the area, your chances are much lower. Good luck. But I would avoid if I were you."
493,2,Mix of talent and pork,Producer,"Brand recognition, relatively competitive benefits package, office facilities were adequate for an office of this size, some SCEA perks were nice due to affiliation with Sony. Some very talented individuals within the organization motivated to doing great things.","Too much office politics, constant dealings with emotional, irrational management.
