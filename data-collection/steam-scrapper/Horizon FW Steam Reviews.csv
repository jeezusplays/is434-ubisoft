1,Horizon Forbidden West™ Complete Edition,76561198184983610,"Such a massive game and quite tiring to play if you include all the side quests and activities.  The main story is however quite engaging and most of the first game's mechanics are improved upon.. uh well nothing much to complain really especially that this port runs quite well. 

It is a big  thumbs up for now since it doesnt require PSN. But knowing Sony, expect a remaster edition in a year or so lol.. so that they could inject in us their filthy business practices rofl xD",True,17,7825
2,Horizon Forbidden West™ Complete Edition,76561198966009863,"Starting things off, before playing this you should play Horizon Zero Dawn first, if you don't own it already, I'd wait for the Remaster and check if it's any good (but it should be, as there's only updates to graphics and audio for the most part). 

After I completed Horizon Zero Dawn for the first time knowing there is a sequel, I was very interested in how they will continue that story as it covered quiet a lot of things. Interestingly enough, I'm surprised that they pulled it off as well as they did and even teased for another sequel. I'm welcoming this very much, this is one of the best current Story Games in my opinion (In series obviously). 

Talking about the elephant in the room: Graphics
You need a lot of performance to handle this game, so sadly a midrange PC build will struggle with this. If you have seen the Hardware recommendations, the lower recommendations seem to be directed at running the game at 1080p 30 FPS, and to most of us, 60 FPS is the lowest they dare to go, myself included. So if you plan to play this, I'd recommend waiting for an upgrade. 
To compare, I've started playing this on a Laptop with AMD Ryzen 75800H and AMD Radeon RX 6600M, I've got it to run on 1080p 40-50 FPS with FSR 3 on, but it dips a lot in performance, especially in cutscenes. I did not bother to continue on  said hardware and now I'm very fluently running the game at 1440p 120 on an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D and AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. 

Story:
As said, you should play Horizon Zero Dawn first, this game directly places itself behind that Storyline. It will also clear some things up because of some puns Aloy will drop here and there. 
I wouldn't say it has the inferior Story compared to Horizon Zero Dawn, but it is certainly very high up. This is because Horizon Zero Dawns Story really has to explain everything from the ground up and it did that very well. Most of the milestones for the story were already laid, so I don't expect much more to come out of it. What they definitely did better compared to Horizon Zero Dawn was the way they immersed us into the story thanks to the way better dialogue sequences. In Horizon Zero Dawn (Original) especially Sidequests and also some Dialogues in the Main quest lacked expression and emotion. To see it improved here makes me really happy and to know there's a Remaster for Horizon Zero Dawn that will (hopefully) fix that issue just adds to that. 

Getting used to the new melee system was a bit difficult to me since I'm used to the one in Horizon Zero Dawn. It isn't much different, but the new Melee combos weren't a playstyle for me. Same goes for some of the new Weapons. I didn't really get used to them, and avoided them in the best way possible since I either like to stealth or use a Bow or Precision Bow. They are just not fitting for my playstyle. The new elemental effects are pretty great though, though I'd like to have Tutorials for using them correctly. I've been confused a lot of times when using Plasma arrows or using the Shredder Gauntlet. 

Aside from all that, as always, you decide your playstyle, how you go in, what weapon you choose, if you sneak by or attack. Aside from the hunting grounds and the melee fights it will always be in your control how you fight. Difficulty wise, it's similar to Horizon Zero Dawn, Easy to Learn, Hard to Master. So even as a beginner with knowledge of the basics of a controller and knowing where which button is by muscle memory will be enough for you to enjoy this game. 

I very much recommend to play this (obviously after having played Horizon Zero Dawn)",True,8,8462
3,Horizon Forbidden West™ Complete Edition,76561199053188452,"TLDR at the start here

Amazing game with incredible visuals, improved-ish combat system, great story and phenomenal character roster with great mocap and voice acting. Solid 10/10

Now for more a more detailed (spoiler free) review

The combat system in this game is both a massive jump forwards when compared to Zero Dawn and equally more frustrating and overly complex.  It took much longer for me to properly grasp how you can best use Aloy's abilities to move and fight more effectively.

On the topic of combat there are some new weapon types, these include Shredders which I found marginally useful, Boltcasters (think automatic crossbow) which are fun but heavy weapons that I got some good time into using, Sharpshot, Warrior and Hunter bows all make a return but sadly the Tearblaster doesn't (big sad) I like that the game tries to make all weapon types viable depending on your particular build that you run, changing weapons on the fly is certainly a good tactic and one I used multiple times.

There are some negatives with the combat though (as previously alluded to), the biggest one for me was the removal of the ""long dodge roll"" which was a really good move in Zero Dawn that allowed you to dodge AoE or large slashing attacks more consistently, I wouldn't mind the removal of this so much if the game didn't have a greater emphasis on melee attacks and combos, personally I didn't use them outside of when the game forced me to and the rare time an enemy snuck up behind me.

The skill tree is massively overhauled with more skills to learn in more branches, most have a good use and the valor surges are fun to use, on future playthroughs I'm going to take a deeper look at which I should use.

Moving on to enemies and the world in general.

The amount of machines has been hugely increased, with Corrupted/Daemonic machine variants replaced by Apex versions, personally I prefer this system as unlike Corrupted/Daemonic the weaknesses generally don't change and aren't set to ""only fire can really harm it"" which adds more diversity to the options you have when engaging them.

The new machines are both great and small, with a large portion of the machines from Zero Dawn making a return, my slight gripe is the first machines you meet in game (Burrowers) cannot be oneshot to the eye like Watchers were in Zero Dawn, this may be a deliberate choice to get the player used to using melee weapons (like previously talked about with the slightly reworked combat system) but I found it slightly discouraging, not the biggest issue though.  The new large machine types are a barrel of fun to fight, I loved figuring out the ways you could most effectively take them down and how to maximise damage while avoiding as much in return, and the design of them is top notch as well just like Zero Dawn.

The world, map and places are incredible, Guerrilla Games really hit the nail on the head with this one, each new area is visually stunning with a distinct style and aesthetic, I loved exploring the different Tenakth tribes and how they're all so unique but related in subtle ways.  I'm genuinely impressed with how well they do this.  Then you have the later groups that appear towards the end (I won't name them here for reasons) which continue the distinct and inspired visual style which is so recognisable and incredible to look at.

The story is well done, although like Zero Dawn I do feel like it takes a bit of time to truly kick into gear, and it's not until about 20 or more hours in that I felt like I was really starting to progress through the set pieces of the storyline, that being said that is most likely my fault for sidequesting so much.  After then I was really captivated by the story, learning and observing all the different emotions, interests and goals combining and clashing with the various factions at play.

Speaking of, Characters time, Aloy returns in full form, watching her grow throughout the game was amazing, going from someone who works solo to embracing the team around her and truly having friends, the new and old side characters that are brought back are intriguing and just as well written, with some moments between them being highlights of the game for me.

And lastly I'll briefly touch on the finale for the main story (excluding Burning Shores, just the main game), very well done, with a somewhat predictable move from one of the characters, but after what had happened just before you start the finale quest watching a scene during the finale got me hyped, it was almost cathartic watching the scene play out.

Anyways, yappathon over and here is my final verdict:

10/10 overall package, can't wait for a sequel (also looking forward to the Zero Dawn Remaster)",True,4,7855
4,Horizon Forbidden West™ Complete Edition,76561198053800601,"A great game, one of the best open world games I have played. Beautiful graphics and animations but most importantly a well crafted and written world with engaging characters and narratives. However, while it has some improvements over Zero Dawn, it isn't a complete upgrade over the previous game. Notably the story, narrative and writing while top notch are a downgrade from the original. The Narrative Director John Gonzalez from the first game left the studio and honestly it shows - it simply doesn't have the same atmosphere or bite the first game had. But that is to be expected Zero Dawn was always going to be a hard (impossible) act to follow.

Seriously, you could just play this game to wander around and look at the scenery.  And the music is excellent.  How neither of these games won Game of the Year is beyond me.

6,Horizon Forbidden West™ Complete Edition,76561198035378354,"Story doesnt match the Zero Dawn levels, everything is dumbed down and blurred, softened. HC scifi fans will cry tears of blood watching this unveil.
Still, story is not the problem here, it is at least good, when being perfect is difficult for the sequel.
NPCs are dumb and boring, half way though the game my favourite character was Sylens, because everyone else was self focused source of endless monologues. I would pay Regalla to get rid of half of the vrew and their giggling and BS.
Still, it would be bearable, and becomes frustrating becaude the worst part...Crafting and Quest system. This is so retarded I lack words for description. Running there and back collecting bullshit from dead creatures, having to slay hordes of them just to get one part that is consumed for one upgrade nad then repeat this for another weapon is hyperfriustrating. In addition, characters dealing quests in multiple instances like...Meet me there and we will talk....ok nice that you are here so lets meet there and talk,...finaly you are here so lets  go somewhere miles away and then lets meet on the original location so I can tell you your reward depends on some BS crature you can kill in another faraway locations...aaaaah that is making me angry even to think about it. Tennakh are supposed to be the fiercest warriors ever, but man they are uncapable of survival during the sunny and peacefull day, you need to solve so much unbelievable crap it looks everyone else aroun the world is just another child. The only mature charactes being Kotallo a nd Sylens, sometimes Gaia. Even Alloy feels detached from real problems, solving every possible issue there is, the immersion into saving the world and any thrill from time pressure is killed by game designers. And thos...lazy bastards solving most of issues with level desig by invissible walls and multiple nonsense obstacles only to prolongue the gameplaya and to keep you in.

8,Horizon Forbidden West™ Complete Edition,76561198125220960,"I really wanted to like this game; but I can't.

Overall: Who directed this? Were they drunk the whole time?

Mechanics:
Are there a bunch of new things, yes. Do they make sense? Absolutely not. Elements on machines got shuffled seemingly at random. New elements exist, but produce useless or redundant effects. Everything has AOEs & your I-frames and dodge distance are reduced. Why is the damage and health scaling so high? Early game a Thunderjaw breaths on you and you die; late game you can let a scrapper wail on you for minutes and be fine.

Story:
For story, the main concept is really cool and has a pretty neat twist. But every individual scene has me wincing like I’m watching something made by some high school edgelord who thinks it’s the coolest.

The whole game just feels like a Horizon-ish cash-grab sequel.",False,3,5661
9,Horizon Forbidden West™ Complete Edition,76561197993472726,"[h1]Highly uneven experience[/h1]
This game is such a mixed bag. While it retains some of the qualities from the first game it also fails miserably in other areas. As I'll get into below, I enjoyed some of the more technical aspects of the gameplay, but if they stand alone there's a limit to how long that can carry the experience. And that - all-in-all - makes it hard for me to recommend the game.

[h3]The good[/h3]
[list]
[*]The core gameplay is basically the same (typical action/adventure RPG) and works well enough as the base structure of the game. Also, things like diving and flying ads new and interesting dimensions to the gameplay.
[*]I loved the combat mechanics in the first game and even more so in this. It retains enough of the elements and qualities to make you feel at home, but it's also changed enough (weapons and machines) so you have to relearn everything. It's a fine balance and I think they did it right. They also expanded the options massively so that there's a lot more scope to find your own fighting style.
[*]The new and updated machines are pretty cool and it's generally good fun to figure out how to fight them.
[*]And just as in the first game, the visuals are just stunningly beautiful. The engine is, of course, updated to bump the detail and quality, but the basic experience of awe is the same. Well done.
[/list]

[h3]The bad[/h3]
[list]
[*]The best thing I can say about the story is that the best parts are unexcitingly mediocre. Sadly, the worst parts are mindbogglingly idiotic to the point where you have to ask what kind of a world the writers are living in. I'm sure my neighbours have heard me shout ""YOU'VE GOT TO BE F-ING KIDDING ME!!"" multiple times. It's so sad - especially considering the story in the first game was SO GOOD. But here I had to force myself to finish the main game because I couldn't care less how it ended. And I gave up on the DLC, because.. why bother.
[*]The side quests are generally uninspiring as pretty much all of them follow the same formula of helping someone finding a lost person or thing, and they generally lack relevance and connection to the main story.
[*]Pretty much all of the characters in this game are insufferable. Aloy in particular constantly acts and talks with a snide smugness - like everyone and everything is beneath her importance. If I'm to spend hundreds of hours in her company as a player, I might want her to have at least a minimum level of charm but there's nothing here. Nada. The rest of the characters are ranging from neutral/anonymous to downright insufferable. Nearly every time one of them hooked up with Aloy for a quest, I couldn't wait for it to end to get rid of them. The only intriguing character is Sylens. With his clear intelligence, rationality and willingness to do whatever it takes makes him stand out completely. And the excellent voice work by Lance Reddick gave him a striking presence in every scene he's in - unlike any other character. But, of course, they had to dismantle that towards the end in order to portray Aloy as clearly superior (hint: they failed).
[*]The ""designs"" (writing) of the various cultures never made much sense in the first game, but it took a step for the worse in this. It's like the writers read ""Tribal cultures for dummies"", made a short list from that, and then filled the massive gaps with whatever wishful thinking that came to mind. These are hunter/gatherer/warrior tribes, but they feel like something out of a nonsensical, hippie, new age dream. If the writers had studied even the minimal amount of history and cultural evolution, everything would have been entirely different. And a lot more interesting.
[*][b]Bad implementation of controller gyro.[/b] The good news is that the game itself supports gyro out-of-the-box, which is still quite unusual. At least they tried. The bad news is, that the implementation is barely an improvement over no gyro. It ONLY works with active focus or aiming (drawn weapon), and the movement is very limited - even with the sensitivity set to max. The right stick still works as a sluggish, motorized camera control with no option for e.g. Flick Stick. You can access the in-game gyro option through Steam Input but it only works with the mentioned limitations - no option to have it generally on, and no option to use a button to (de)activate gyro. What's even worse is that controller and keys+mouse inputs cuts each other off so that they can't be combined, which is the most used work-around (keeping base controls but mapping gyro + right stick ""Flick Stick"" to mouse). As soon as the game detects either input type, the other is cut off. This forced me to spend an entire Sunday to map the whole controller to keys+mouse and several hours after that to fine-tune the setup. I really wish game developers would wake up to how far the use of gyro has come in the community.

[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]
The story is inspired by the first game and is therefore very good, but the dialogue and characters are a disaster.
The characters are empty, they worship the superhero like idiots, no strength, no desire, submission, pride in being weak and the dialogue is pitiful.
Like me, you can skip the dialogue of the secondary missions, but you still have to put up with the silliness of the main story, because the desire to see it through to the end is important.
The wokist ideology is everywhere on the game, all clones with a well endocrtined robot speech.
go woke, go broke.

The fighting and animation save the gameplay, thank you zero dawn. Fortunately, sometimes this woke stuff is able to reproduce what humans have done in the past.
The story is a sequel to zero dawn and in zero dawn we have enemies faithful to this new world, but in forbiden west the devs couldn't help but piss us off with their shitty politics.
Character evolution and the upgrading system sucks, I wonder what it's even for.

[h1] Graphic design: [/h1]
The map is beautiful, the world just as big as in Zero Dawn, maybe even bigger.
The machines are very well made and their behavior is correct and respects that of Zero Dawn.
They also had to make Aloy ugly... well, this stupid wokes hate everything that's not like them.

[h3] This game takes a positive review despite the overly destructive wokism that spoils many aspects of the game, but I must also say that this forbiden west is absolutely no match for Zero Dawn. [/h3]

13,Horizon Forbidden West™ Complete Edition,76561197979858497,"It's been a long time since I've been so disappointed in a game. 

The game looks incredible, perfectly optimized for PC, battles with machines are still as interesting as in the Zero Dawn, but that's about it. 

After the first game you expect an interesting continuation of the story, more varied quests and character interaction, but there is none of that here. 

The characters are horribly characterized, they're not interesting and after 60 hours I don't even remember their names. It's been a long time since I've been in an RPG where I've skipped dialoges just to get to the end as I'm sure the quest will still ask me to go to the other end of the location, illuminate the tracks with my visor and kill a machine. It's like the entire budget was spent on the visual part of the game, and the quests were created and written by AI.

This is a game I can somewhat recommend to those who enjoyed fighting the machines in the first game, but those who came here for the interesting story would be better off watching the lore explanation on YouTube.
